Hillary Clinton’s national campaign headquarters was evacuated Friday evening after a white powdery substance was discovered.The standard, white envelope was found by a staffer at Clinton’s 45th St. office in Manhattan, where mail is received, around 5:30 p.m. It was then taken to her Brooklyn headquarters.The 11th floor office at One Pierrepont Plaza in Brooklyn Heights was evacuated after a second staffer called 911.An NYPD spokesman declined to identify the substance, but said that tests showed it was not harmful. A total of four people were exposed to the substance but no one reported health problems.The incident just adds to an extremely intense and divisive election season. Earlier this week, GOP headquarters in Orange County, North Carolina, was firebombed when a flammable bottle of liquid was thrown through the windows.The liquid ignited the inside of the office and caused a fire to rage before it finally burned itself out. A swastika alongside the words “Nazi Republicans get out of town or else” was written on a wall outside. The Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives was working with local police to determine who was responsible.The Republican offices in Indiana were also attacked this month when vandals threw bricks through the windows. Signs for Donald Trump and Todd Young were hanging on the window at the time. Luckily, no one was injured.In Bangor, Maine, 20 cars were spray-painted outside of a Trump rally. A video of the damage can be seen below… Trump supporters in Bangor, ME >> leave the rally to find their cars spray painted. pic.twitter.com/jW5UzkdkoB— #BasketOfDeplorables (@betioserrano) October 15, 2016   H/T FOX
