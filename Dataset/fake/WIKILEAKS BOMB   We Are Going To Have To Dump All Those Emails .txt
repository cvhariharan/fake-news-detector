It finally happened. A true, honest to goodness easy to understand smoking gun popped up in one of the WikiLeaks John Podesta email caches.  This one came in WikiLeaks drop number 25, but here it is.It just so happens that the date of the email above was March 2, 2015 – the same day that the New York Times published a story titled, “Hillary Clinton Used Personal Email Account at State Department, Possibly Breaking Rules.”  Imagine that.  What this means could be anyone’s guess, but the reality is that when questioned about “intent” and the destruction of emails that would prove either that Barack Obama and company knew Hillary Clinton was using a personal email or that all of those emails that were destroyed by BleachBit were part of some cover up.  That at least points to intent, if not proves it.  Remember, lack of intent is what is being used as the excuse to NOT prosecute Hillary Clinton for any of her crimes.What is also intriguing in this exchange, and one adjacent to it in the full universe of Podesta emails, is the mention of “Lanny.” It is suggested that “Lanny” is Lanny Davis, Bill Clinton’s personal counsel.  From Zero Hedge:Furthermore, a search for Lanny Davis reveals the following curious exchange between Robby Mook and John Podesta from March 8, 2015, just days after the above mentioned exchange, in which Mook saysIt seems the Clinton campaign was not happy with being set on a course of transparency by Bill Clinton’s special counsel.That would be an understatement if the purpose of getting rid of the emails was to cover up their existence. As it was at the time, the White House press people were busy not denying any of this happening.Is this enough to put the final torpedo in the hull of the SS Hillary?  Maybe not. But it is a definite step in the right direction.
