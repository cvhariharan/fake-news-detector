FINALLY! Somebody out there has had enough of Megyn Kelly and went off on her on national television.  No less than Former Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrigh, a far more experienced person in American politics, and towering intellect within the swamp of Washington, D.C., took her apart on her show Tuesday night.Note to Megyn Kelly and all the other women out there trying to make it in a man’s world, if you’re going to go there, expect to be treated just the way Newt treats Megyn here.  Like an equal.  No special treatment just because you have ovaries and a vagina.Watch this all the way to the end.  You won’t be sorry.Being one of the many people who would like to see Megyn Kelly crawl back to whatever trailer park she came from, this was delicious. It’s not hard to figure out that the poll numbers don’t match the empirical evidence of the size of Donald Trump rallies.  The WikiLeaks emails from John Podesta tell the story of poll weighting, not for getting them right, but for showing that one candidate is ahead when maybe he or she isn’t.As for Donald Trump and the pussy statement: WHO CARES! It is possible that the women accusing him of this, that or the other thing were rejected in some way by him. Yes, women will make up stuff like that. In addition, yet more Podesta emails demonstrate that at least some of the accusations were planned months in advance. This is all political posturing, just as Newt says.Newt’s right.  Megyn is fascinated with sex and doesn’t care about public policy, no matter her protestations about wanting to protect the women of America. (We could say that about just about the entire news media, but who wants to get in the middle of that orgy.)Bravo, Newt. That was worth breaking the personal ban on Megyn Kelly in this writer’s life.
