Everyone heard about the black homeless woman who guarded and defended Trumps LA sidewalk star.  She got attacked by a group of radical liberals who beat her to a pulp.  She really took a beating and Clinton says that “Trump supporters are violent”. What a crock! Hillary’s Campaign paid those “violent supporters” $1,500.00 each to cause riots and injury to Trumps loyal movement. This  truth came out in a Wikileaks email. The clip shows how violent LA liberals were to this poor woman.The homeless woman is in hiding and the LAPD is looking for her.  Micheal Cohen, the attorney for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is looking for the homeless Black woman seen on video being attacked by a mob of Hillary Clinton supporters as she protected Trump’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame after it was sledgehammered by a Clinton supporter earlier this week.Trump Organization EVP, Micheal Cohen and Special Counsel to Donald J. Trump, spoke out on Twitter Friday evening about Mr. Trump’s desire–before it was known to him that she was attacked by the Clinton mob–to present an unspecified gift to the woman. Cohen said he had a friend in Hollywood looking for her.After learning she had been attacked, Cohen promised she would have “the last laugh on these thugs.”Cohen told a supporter to not contact the Trump campaign about the woman but to DM him on Twitter with any information as to her whereabouts., indicating this has become a personal matter for Trump.As soon as they find her, Trump will reward her with a fabulous gift that everyone in the USA will hear about and we can be sure it’s a generous gift of cash. It’s just a matter of finding her in order for Trump to give it to her. Many people are searching and everyone hopes she is still alive!A homeless American protects @realDonaldTrump Hollywood star. 20 million illegals & Americans sleep on the streets in Tents #VoteTrump.@DiamondandSilk @realDonaldTrump someone please help me locate this woman as Mr. Trump has a gift for her…. @MichaelCohen212 @DiamondandSilk @realDonaldTrump Yaaass!
