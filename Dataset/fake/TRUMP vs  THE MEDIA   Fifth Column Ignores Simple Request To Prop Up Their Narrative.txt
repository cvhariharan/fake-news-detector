If ever there was a microcosm of the Trump vs. The Media row that permeates the America first movement manifesting in the United States, the simple request Donald Trump asked of the cameras at a rally in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania is it.  Watch what happens when The Donald asks the people operating the cameras to show the crowd.In the video, multiple cameras did move, but the majority did not.  The camera angles are generally concentrating on Trump himself, and what he says, trying to catch him in some sort of gaffe.  The narrative pushed by the lying mainstream media is that Hillary Clinton is leading in the polling, and Trump’s train is losing steam.  From the non-mainstream media sources, and witnesses to the rallies that make Donald Trump look like the Energizer Bunny, We the People know that lines to get into the events are long, and that the people attending them come from all walks of life.This video is an example of why Donald Trump has taken on the mainstream media, the corporate media, the people for whom authority in order to build ratings is everything.  For reasons that most people assume have to do with the ownership of the networks, the people charged with keeping the public informed are telling a version of reality that does not exist – and thanks to some whistleblower out there who provided WikiLeaks with tens of thousands of Democratic operatives’ emails, we know that it is in collusion with the opposition.
