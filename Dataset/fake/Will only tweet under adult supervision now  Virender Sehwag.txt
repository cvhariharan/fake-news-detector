New Delhi: After starting a huge political storm with one of his tweets, cricketing legend Virender Sehwag has now agreed to tweet only under adult supervision. The tweet in question has started a Twitter war that is still going strong after 4 days. From ABVP, AISA to Freedom of Expression to Indian Army to Pakistan to Haryana to literacy of sports persons, the war has covered several phases during these past 4 days.The outrage started when Sehwag tweeted this tweet, which escalated after Bollywood actor Randeep Hooda laughed at this tweet.Speaking to Faking News, Sehwag said, “I just tweeted a joke, not a very good joke either, just like most of my jokes, but I had no idea that this will lead to such a huge uproar. I have tweeted several PJs earlier that deserved a bigger outrage actually but I guess life is unpredictable that way. Anyway, to stay safe in future, I will only tweet when I am supervised by an adult. Every tweet will be checked and rechecked multiple times before I click that send button.”“I have already decided that I will only tweet birthday wishes to cricketers now. They don’t get offended even if my birthday wish is a really lame poem. Still, to be on the safer side, I will be under adult supervision whenever I log on to Twitter”, Sehwag added.However, not everyone is convinced that Sehwag will listen to the person supervising him. “He never listened to me when Iw as the coach, fat chance that he will listen to any supervisor now”, said former Indian coach Gary Kirsten.
