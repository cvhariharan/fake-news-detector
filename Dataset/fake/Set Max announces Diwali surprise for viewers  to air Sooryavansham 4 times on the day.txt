Television movie channel Set Max announced a Diwali bonanza for its viewers after various channels threw their schemes to attract maximum number of viewers. The channel, which holds the official broadcasting rights of Sooryavansham, starring Amitabh Bachchan and Amitabh Bachchan in grey beard, has decided to air the film four times on the day of the festival.After getting several requests from viewers to stop airing the same movie every night, the producers at the channel have become even more adamant. Explaining us the reason behind trying to make Sooryavansham everyone’s most hated movie, a channel executive said, “Like the teenager who has many clothes in his wardrobe but still wears the same pair, we have a great collection of movies in our library but will still air Sooryavansham every night, and we will continue to do so.” A Delhi-based viewer has also filed a complaint in the consumer court against the movie channels. “In my complaint, I have specified that all these channels air dubbed movies from the South all day, which is as attempt to influence our culture. We do not even know the difference between Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam movies, so why show it to us all day?” said the aggrieved viewer.Actor Amitabh Bachchan, who plays a double role in Sooryavansham, has distanced himself from the makers of the film. He further intends to buy the broadcasting rights of the film from Set Max. “They show it every night! On Diwali, they have planned to make it more miserable for me. I will buy the broadcasting rights of the movie so that the channel cannot air it,” said the worried actor. Inside reports suggest that the actor, in an attempt of ‘being human’ who cares for his fans, is doing the social service to clean his image in the Panama controversy.
