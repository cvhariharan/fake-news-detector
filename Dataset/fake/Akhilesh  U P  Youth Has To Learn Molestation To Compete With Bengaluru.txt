Saifai: Samajwadi Party leader Abu Azmi recently sparked a new controversy, seemingly blaming the women who were allegedly subjected to molestation on New Year’s Eve for the shocking incident by suggesting they had strayed away from “Indian culture”.Akhilesh Yadav, the present CM of U.P. has taken this opportunity to inspire the U.P. youth to practice molestation, or else states like Karnataka, Goa and Haryana will always stay ahead of them. Akhilesh has also announced that government will open some molestation coaching classes where youth will be taught to molest girls and run away from the scene.
