Taking cognizance of the anguish among many employees about dry fruits being handed out as Diwali gifts, Supreme Court has put a ban on such gifts.The top court had earlier banned sale of firecrackers in Delhi, which saw people of Delhi expressing their displeasure on social media.However the latest ban on dry fruits did not elicit any such reaction. In fact many welcomed the move and said it was long due.“Every year it’s that same box of dry fruits. My company boasts of good profit figures but falls woefully short when it comes to gifting options. This year my wife threatened to leave me if I got another box of kaaju-badam,” said Manjit Singh, an IT employee working in Gurgaon.Govt has said that it will abide by Supreme Court’s decision and urged citizens to think for some options. While speaking to our reporter Home Minister Rajnath Singh said, “Jo log kaju-badam dete hain unki mai kadi ninda karta hu.”Many who had already purchased boxes of dry fruits to be given away as gifts are now finding themselves in a quandary. “Abhi ye sab mujhe hi khana padega,” said a businessman while pointing towards a room full of dry fruit cartons.Senior lawyer Sam Jhoothmalani however was critical and said that SC should leave it to the people to decide instead of making it difficult for them. “I dont know what the problem with dry fruits is. Free me mil raha hai usme bhi problem. Pasand nahi aaya toh doosra cover chadhake kisi aur ko gift kar do. Mai bhi aisa hi karta hu,” he said.
