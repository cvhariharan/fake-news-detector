New Delhi: A man aged 20 years was admitted to hospital as he collapsed from shock at being offered a seat in the Delhi Metro. Doctors have since diagnosed him with the Privileged Victim Syndrome (PVS) and say that this accident might have helped save his life. He would have probably lost his life if the disorder wasn’t treated soon.The condition is highly prevalent in urban areas among upper-class young males. It causes patients to become insensitive to the plight of disadvantaged social groups and makes them angry at the ‘special treatment’ that others get but they are denied.The patient spoke to us about his condition. “It is quite exhausting to be nice to everyone. This incident has helped me realize that I was going through the trauma of being denied the right to misbehave in my own country. Can you imagine having to struggle to get a good education? Can you imagine having to respect women when I don’t even think of them as human beings? Why am I being made to feel as if I’m not the second-most important person in the country? (I know who the most important person is, I’m not an entitled brat.)”The Chief of Looting Helpless Citizens (CLHC) at Expensively Mediocre Hospital told this newspaper that the number of cases reported is increasing day by day. She advises citizens to watch out for the most common symptoms: having an exceptional sense of entitlement, renouncing any responsibility for their behaviour, and whining about social mechanisms to help marginalized groups.
