WikiLeaks Clinton Goldman Sachs Speeches – Golden Years As Wall St SenatorHillary Clinton’s version of confession is when she goes before Goldman Sachs or their fat cat equivalent and actually tells something resembling the truth. We thought she didn’t have it in her because, as members of the public and the American people that she so loathes, it’s something we haven’t previously been exposed to.The latest WikiLeaks release from Friday included an email from Clinton Campaign Research Director Tony Carrk, dated 01/23/2016 with the subject of Goldman Sachs paid speeches. The email was a collection of portions of three speeches Clinton gave to her financiers at Goldman Sachs. Below are two excerpts from a speech on October 24th, 2013.Clinton said, “And with political people, again, I would say the same thing, you know, there was a lot of complaining about Dodd-Frank, but there was also a need to do something because for political reasons, if you were an elected member of Congress and people in your constituency were losing jobs and shutting businesses and everybody in the press is saying it’s all the fault of Wall Street, you can’t sit idly by and do nothing, but what you do is really important.” [GS2, 10/24/13]Clinton said, “I represented all of you for eight years. I had great relations and worked so close together after 9/11 to rebuild downtown, and a lot of respect for the work you do and the people who do it, but I do — I think that when we talk about the regulators and the politicians, the economic consequences of bad decisions back in ’08, you know, were devastating, and they had repercussions throughout the world.” [GS2, 10/24/13]Like an Albatross, bad decisions follow Clinton wherever she goes.Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.
