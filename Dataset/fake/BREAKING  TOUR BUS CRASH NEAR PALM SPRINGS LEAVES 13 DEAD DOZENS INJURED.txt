A morning tour bus crash in the Southern California desert is now the deadliest on California highways in years. It has claimed the lives of at least 13 people, sending dozens more to area hospitals with injuries ranging from minor to major; five were listed in critical condition with three additional listed as serious.The crash occurred sometime after 5 a.m. Pacific time on the I-10 westbound lanes at Indian Canyon. It is speculated by Poet Aleman, a witness to the incident, that the semi truck appeared to move into a lane occupied by the tour bus, which then ran into the back of the trailer, becoming completely engulfed by it as far as several rows back. Firefighters used chainsaws to extricate victims from inside the bus with little room to maneuver.“The whole front of the bus up to about the second or third row of seats was completely crushed into the left rear side of the semi truck,” Aleman told The Desert Sun. “By the time I got there there were at least a dozen firefighters climbing into the passenger bus pulling people out.”This deadly accident completely halted traffic for hours on the westbound lanes with curious onlookers clogging traffic on the eastbound lanes to gaze onto the horrific scene. All westbound lanes remain closed at this time. The CHP estimates it may be until 4 p.m. until the westbound lanes are reopened.
