True to his word, James O’Keefe of Project Veritas delivered yet another video to the world telling the tale of how back door politics works.  Yes, it is very much a pay to play kind of thing, and in video #4 of the Project Veritas series, the James O’Keefe crew explains a little more of how they managed to get all that undercover video. Yes, it’s sneaky, underhanded…and what undercover journalism is really all about.Isn’t it amazing what can happen when cash greases the right palms? New jobs, immigration lawyers, access to Hillary, etc. Also what seems to be amazing is just how much of the information that came out in the WikiLeaks John Podesta emails seems to be part of the James O’Keefe videos.It’s as if the Clinton Campaign, and the political action committees were actually working together. Thanks to all the whistleblowers, we now have proof that they are.And then there was this:In an unexpected twist, AUFC president Brad Woodhouse, the recipient of the $20,000, heard that Project Veritas Action was releasing undercover videos exposing AUFC’s activities. He told a journalist that AUFC was going to return the twenty thousand dollars.Woodhouse said it was because they were concerned that it might have been an illegal foreign donation. Project Veritas Action was pleased but wondered why that hadn’t been a problem for the month they had the money.Good question.  (For those who know they’ve seen Brad Woodhouse, but can’t quite place his face, THIS happened almost two years ago on C-Span.)The last two weeks of the 2016 presidential election campaign promise to be one October surprise after another – and it’s almost November.  The Clinton campaign is not going to give up with the dirty tricks and it is up to We the People to continue to ignore them and report any voting irregularities we see.
