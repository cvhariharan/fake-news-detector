There’s not much that drives Americans more insane than celebrities trying to prove their smarts only to make themselves sound REALLY stupid.  Take Robert De Niro for example.  The Raging Bull star is renowned in Hollywood for going the extra mile in preparing for new characters.  He’s the epitome of a professional when it comes to that.When it comes to recognizing smarts – street, book and otherwise – and knowing who really needs a punch in the mouth…not so much.De Niro, with his over inflated sense of self importance, decided to demonstrate his lack of recognition in the brains department by recording his own little rant and sending it to Megyn Kelly of Fox News.  And Megyn Kelly being an attention who herself, ACTUALLY PUT IT ON THE AIR!  Watch:It makes most Americans angry that this country has gotten to the point that it’s going to take a street gutter fighter willing to get his hands dirty and his hair messed up to straighten out the mess that the Washington, D.C., incest cesspool made of it.  Someone who is stupid isn’t going to punk the media like The Donald did on Sunday night.  (Brilliant move.)What is also maddening is when people like De Niro don’t see the evidence that those in charge are the ones who sent the country in the wrong direction in the first place.  And he thinks more of the same is going to change that?  That is insanity by definition.Those of us who do care about this country WILL be voting for it in November.  We will be voting for preservation of our way of life, restoration of lost liberties and rights, and stopping the rape of the nation in the form of government interference in the economy and commodities exploitation.  We will be sending a message, even if the effort fails, that we are not happy with the status quo.  We will also be repudiating all those “elites” who think of the little people as deplorable.As for who needs a punch in the mouth?  Why waste the time.  (Besides, I might break a nail.)
