LOC: 40 terrorists killed, 2 soldiers guarding them also reached their end. India claimed a successful surgical strike and Pakistan denied occurrence of any surgical strike. Teekhi Mirchi has exclusive details about why they denied occurence of this surgical strike.At around 4:30 AM that day, an army man went to the house of a guy to inform him about the surgical strike. (The guy, btw is a senior diplomat aligned with the most Sharif govt on the planet). After thinking deeply for a few minutes, he asked the army personnel how many questions did Indian army asked them.Left Shocked, army personnel replied, “Sir it was a surgical strike, not an interview!”“Then go to ‘Newshour’, and you will know what actually is a surgical strike,” replied the guy.“Yesterday Arnab told me that their nation wanted to know why Pakistan did not stop those Jihadis (terrorists) from entering India and perpetrating Uri attack. He ended up raising questions on my lineage. He did not even provide me a single minute in total show to speak, and he kept raising questions. He also asked me 80 times, to ask my mother about who’s my father. That is my friend, a surgical strike.”“What did you say?”, asked the army man.“Well, I called up my mother to check as soon as the show got over. Now I am 60% confident. Next time if he asks me, I will be in a better position to handle him.”“Sir, what about the official response for this surgical strike?”“Well, as I said, my friend, if they kill you without asking a single question, that’s not surgical strike. If they keep you alive and keep asking questions, that’s surgical strike. Make it official and deny any surgical strike had ever happened. Tell them all the camps are safe.And they officially denied any thing of the sort to have happened. Twitter users however laughed at it as well.
