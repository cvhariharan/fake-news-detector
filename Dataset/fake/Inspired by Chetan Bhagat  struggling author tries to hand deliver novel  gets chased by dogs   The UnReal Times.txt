Author Chetan Bhagat’s innovative idea of knocking on the doors of his fans at the stroke of midnight and personally hand-delivering a copy of his latest book has been making news on the Internet.“Did you see that?” an awestruck Unreal Mama asked friend and writer Ashwin Kumar. “What a great idea! We should do that too!”“Um, ok,” said Ashwin, doubtfully.“We too have fans. We too have a book, arguably a far better one than Bhagat’s. I can also knock on people’s doors, hand them a copy and watch their eyes come alive with happiness. I can also click selfies with their entire families! I can do this!”“Uh, sure,” said Ashwin, not looking sure at all.Excited, Unreal Mama picked up a shiny new copy of “Unreal Aliens”, waited until midnight, put on a baseball cap a la Chetan Bhagat, and stepped out of his home. He decided to start with the neighbouring society.As he slipped through the gate, he held up his phone to record himself and said, “I am standing outside Janakpuri C2 Block. I’m going to surprise its residents with a copy of Unreal Aliens!”Unfortunately for him, things did not go according to plan. A shadowy figure in a security guard’s uniform appeared down the road.“Kaun hai be?” he asked, swishing his stick. As if on cue, two black dogs appeared out of nowhere, let out a blood curdling growl and ran full-tilt towards Unreal Mama. Abandoning all thoughts of surprising his fans, Unreal Mama dropped the book, took to his heels, and did not stop till he was within the safety of his home.In conclusion, dear readers, please don’t wait for Unreal Mama to wake you up in the middle of the night.
