 “Its OK yaar, ladkiyan to lakshmi hoti hain, luck le ke aati hain ….Bow Bow Bow……Blah Blah…”“Kanya Devi Hai, Lakshi Hai…..Badd Badd Badd……… “These are lines that I am hearing since last 2-3 days, since my 2nd daughter is born.This is to all my fellow congratulate-ors who come in the garb of concerned relatives/ friends, please stop coming like a cover up artist.You all can come like an actual happy person, and actually congratulate me if you are happy, else don’t bring your banters to me. I AM actually HAPPY Bhai Log. Mujhe Santvana Ki Zaroorat Nahin Hai!On a serious note, I would like to humbly request everyone, please don’t burden the new born (no matter what their gender is), don’t burden them with HUGE responsibilities to be like gods or goddesses. Let a normal child be a sweet normal child, be it a boy or a girl. If you become rich or poor after your child, it is only because of your deeds or may be some law of Karma. But it certainly has nothing to do with that child.Let’s make a clarity to our own-self, that daughters and sons are the child at first place, and then they become a part of this social system at a later stage. Stop measuring and burdening their present with an un-realized future.DISCLAIMER: I and my beautiful wife were only interested in a HEALTHY child and not at all in a boy or a girl. Yeah preference can be there, but abnormally, we both were not preferential. We will try to improve, in order to be a fitment to this system in next lives.
