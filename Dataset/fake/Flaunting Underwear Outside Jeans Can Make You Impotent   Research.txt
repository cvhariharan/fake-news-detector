Massachusetts: If you too are habitually flaunting underwear outside your jeans in order to impress and attract women, then beware.A reputed institute making research on reproductive capabilities of species has claimed it can make you impotent. As the popular saying goes-I wandered here and there, to become Macho-Man, Alas! My bad luck, I became half-man!Like always, this is also a contribution of western influence, and is called ‘sagging’ in popular culture there.Men usually wear their underwear a bit higher than their pant to flaunt their expansive underwear brand, such as Jokey and Hanes. According to psychologists, men do this trick to attract women for mating. This behavior was developed in humans through millions of years of natural selection, and proves Charles Darwin’s theory of Evolution.Although this habit was developed naturally in order to help men reproduce more, because it creates apt environment for mating, but researchers say this has weakened our natural ability to attract women, that according to Natural Selection process, will fade away and go extinct. It will have direct bearing on our ability to reproduce and eventually make our species extinct.
