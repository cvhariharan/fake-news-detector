Never in my life have I seen a political hit job like the targeting Donald Trump. Thanks to Wikileaks, we now know that the liberal media bias is not some right wing conspiracy. Hillary Clinton is pushing outright lies and “news” outlets, such as CNN, are reporting them as if they were fact.This week, CNN has been in full force with their attempts to paint Trump as a rapist. They have interviewed every woman from Trump’s past who had something negative to say about him. They referred to these women as “victims” while minimizing Bill Clinton’s REAL rape victims by calling them “accusers”.The liberal bias has never been more apparent than it was this week. The Hillary campaign was SURE their lies would ruin Trump, they were wrong.New polls released today show Trump has actually closed the gap and is now in the margin of error with Hillary Clinton.From the Washington Post: It seems that American voters have a problem blindly believing women who claimed to be traumatized by Trump 30 years ago, but didn’t really feel the need to express it until 3 weeks before an election. Voters were also skeptical about the fact that Trump’s accusers just happen to be donors and supporters of Hillary Clinton.That wasn’t the only good news, The new polls also showed that Trump holds an almost 90% support rate among Republican voters, even after all the media lies about him. On top of that, reports show that hundreds of thousands of swing state voters are switching from Democrat to Republican. Most people don’t realize that pollsters can only ask voters questions if they have been registered with the party for more than one year. Since all of these voters have switched parties this year, they can not participate in polls.It looks like the liberal media lies aren’t working this time. Americans are on to Hillary’s plan and it is backfiring…BIG TIME!
