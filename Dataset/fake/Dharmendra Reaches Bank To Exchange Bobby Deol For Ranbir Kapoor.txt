Mumbai: Dharmendra is a proud father of Bobby and Sunny, although Sunny turned out way more talented than Bobby. Bobby after his initial success dwindled away from the limelight and started doing some average movies.He has not signed any movie in recent times, and even the audience have shown the red signal to the younger Deol. But Dharmendra has not lost hope. According to Dharmendra, Bobby is his 500 Rs note which is of no value in current market. He wants his bank to exchange Bobby and give him a valuable actor like Ranbir Kapoor.Although this is not possible, Dharmendra has urged the government to think about his idea so that fathers like him don’t suffer because of having a mediocre scheme. Jitendra has come out and supported this idea, which puts Tushar Kapoor in trouble as Tushar’s condition in market is not much better than Bobby’s.
