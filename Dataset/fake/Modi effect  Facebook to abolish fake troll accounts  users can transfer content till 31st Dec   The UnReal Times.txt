Just as the Indian economy is facing the evil of black money, Facebook and Twitter have seen the menace of fake and anonymous accounts growing in the past few years. As per the latest data, Facebook has approximately 71 million active Indian users out of which 15 million are anonymous/fake while Twitter has 22 million active Indian users out of which 7 million are anonymous/fake, posing a big threat to the idea of troll-less (white) social media.Announcing this historic move, the CEOs of Facebook and Twitter issued a joint statement: “All anonymous / fake accounts with more than 500 friends / 1000 followers will be suspended at 12 midnight of 9th November. These friends/ followers along with content can be transferred to the original account till 31st December 2016.”Here are some of the highlights of the historic speech:1. No content can be posted / tweeted / shared / re-tweeted from the anonymous/fake account after 12 am of 9th Nov.2. The content of the anonymous account can be transferred by submitting an original DP/ original name. The last date for the same is 31st Dec.3. In case of an emergency post (like trolling a politician / cricketer / film celebrity), user can login using his original login details and post for the next 72 hours.4. All users with less than 100 followers will continue to exist and be spared from suspension.5. A daily withdrawal cap of 2000 tweets/day has been put which will be later increased to 4000 tweets/day“Your content and followers will remain yours. No need to panic. You have 50 days to submit the proof,” assured Zuckerberg.The decision elicited mixed reviews: some predicted that social media will see a downfall in the coming few days while others welcomed the move considering its effects in the long run.
