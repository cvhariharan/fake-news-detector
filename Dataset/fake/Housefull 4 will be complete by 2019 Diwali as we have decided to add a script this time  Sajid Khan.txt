Mumbai: Famous director of Humshakals and Himmatwala, Sajid Khan is coming back to direct housefull 4. Movie lovers are super excited with Sajid returning as director, but they are upset with producer Sajid Nadiadwala who announced, housefull4 will be ready by 2019 Diwali only.“2019 Diwali means I have to wait for two more years and considering Humshakals came in 2014, we will get a chance to see our all-time favorite director’s movie after 5 long years. Bahut na insafi hai ye hamara saath,” said Kamal R Khan, who claims he is the president of Sajid Khan fan association.When some news channels sources started reporting Kamal and his friends are planning to teach producer Nadiadwala a lesson, Sajid Khan came forward to clear the air. “Housefull 4 will not be like my previous movies, this will have a solid script. Myself and my team have gone through two dozen DVDs, I am sorry, what I meant is two dozen scripts. All are so good, we are unable to finalize which one we would pick for houseful 4. That’s the reason we have not decided the cast for the movie. So, do not blame Nadiadwala bhai for the delay in movie release.”We talked to one of the close assistant of Sajid who is involved with the scripting process. While speaking to us anonymously, he said, “Sajid Bhai arranged DVDs from different corners of the world, which was more than two thousand to start with. After going through all of them we have finalized the 12, which Sajid Bhai is watching with us. Now we have to select one, add some of our own creative footage so that no one can blame us for copy right violation. Our part was ready long time back, we are just checking where it can go seamlessly.”   Sajid for a change does not want to repeat his earlier mistake of saying housefull 4 will be the biggest block buster of 2019. “Box office collection mere haath mein nahin ye. But script is in my hands. Undoubtedly it would be the best script of the year,” said Sajid in his trademark super confident manner.
