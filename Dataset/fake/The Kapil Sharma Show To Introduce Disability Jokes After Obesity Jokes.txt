Mumbai: After its failure to achieve enough TRP and viewer’s interest, despite fueling several controversies, producers of The Kapil Sharma Show have come up with a new idea to reinvent the show and replace monotony with innovation. Host of the show Kapil Sharma would now be seen cracking ‘disability jokes’ often to make its viewers laugh.The development comes after organizers of the show realized that it has merely become a promotional platform for upcoming movies and celebrities desperate of making a comeback and getting some eyeballs for their shitty movies.Earlier, the show had made unsuccessful attempts of making its audience laugh by cracking ‘obesity jokes’ repeatedly almost in every episodes. Kapil would often make fun on Palak’s (Kiru Sharda) obesity at least a dozen times every episode, by comparing him to 2 and a half persons, and wondering how he manages to make his neck disappear.
