Now that the Electoral College is showing a Donald Trump “upset” that those of us in flyover country knew was coming, bigger news is not being reported.  Liberals everywhere are in mourning.  Having a Republican in the White House is great and all, and will take care of all of Barack Obama’s illegal executive orders, but even more threatening to the Occupier’s liberal legacy: on Tuesday, the American people voted for a Republican House and Senate with a Republican president for the first time since 1928.  Look at the bottom of the graphic.The votes will be close, and they will be met with derision and disdain, but say good-bye to excessive coal regulations, Obamacare, taxes at confiscation levels, attempts at gun control, and the mass importation of illegal immigrants.THAT is the real threat to liberals and the liberal agenda.  With a Republican Congress, Trump’s platform has a much better chance of becoming a reality.This, of course, depends on leadership in Congress doing THEIR jobs and not just whining about not having a president to sign legislation.  They have to pass it again.  Both Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell remained on the sidelines of the Trump Train, but gave lip service to their support for the Trump agenda following the presidential victory on November 8.Early on Wednesday, shortly after Clinton conceded to Trump, Ryan said in a statement: “We are eager to work hand-in-hand with the new administration to advance an agenda to improve the lives of the American people.”Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, also a Republican, said in a guarded and similarly timed statement: “The American people have chosen a new direction for our nation.”The American people have spoken.  It is in the best interest of the critters in Congress to listen.  The billionaires may do all the lobbying, but We the People hold the ultimate power of the vote.
