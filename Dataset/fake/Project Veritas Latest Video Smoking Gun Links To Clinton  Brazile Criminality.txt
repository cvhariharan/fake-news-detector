The agitator and violence-spawning goon met with Hussein Obama 47 times and made 342 trips to the White House to discuss their disruption campaign at Trump events. He says these orders came straight from the DNC and Hillary Clinton. They were to use duck costumes to troll trump events, the message a “witty” one that Clinton fell in love with, “Donald Ducks Taxes.”Creamer bragged that he was doing the bidding of Clinton when he said, “In the end, it was the candidate, Hillary Clinton, the future president of the United States, (urge to retch suppressed) who wanted ducks on the ground. So by God we will get ducks on the ground.”

He then cautions the Project Veritas reporter, “Don’t repeat that to anybody.” James O’Keefe reveals in the narrative that the ducks which started showing up at Trump events this year was a co-opted idea of Hillary Clinton herself. The idea was to focus attention on Trump’s tax returns at first but could then be expanded to anything they wanted to claim Trump was avoiding for whatever reason.
O’Keefe quotes campaign law experts from whom they have sought advice as stating, “The ducks on the ground are likely ‘public communications’ for purposes of the law. It’s political activity opposing Trump, paid for by Americans United for Change funds but controlled by Clinton/her campaign.”
Scott Foval stated that the message of the day, be it the extremist one or the duck message, and who specifically they will be targeting at each event, is cleared with the DNC on a daily basis, including through Donna Brazile. Foval seemed particularly pleased with himself as he described a plan to set multiple cell phones to go off simultaneously with duck call alarms inside Trump events. That would be coordinated so that the compliant media would hear it and report on it.

Creamer goes on to explain that there was a transfer of control of the ducks to “Americans United for Change” due to a conflict between Donna Brazile and Disney-owned ABC, proving that responsibility went all of the way to the top of the DNC leadership. Despite public claims to the contrary, O’Keefe says that the DNC was still managing the duck and that that activity was a violation of federal campaign coordination laws.
He explains the post-Watergate Campaign Coordination Law that Clinton and her Democrat comrades are in violation of.  O’Keefe notes that following the release of his earlier videos, Clinton denied her connection to Creamer and AUFC. That contradicts the statements he has documented of those directly involved. He says it’s time America demand she tell the truth. It’s a noble goal, Mr. O’Keefe, but Hillary Clinton doesn’t tell the truth.
