Jhajjar: In a first of its kind course, Sehwag International School is set to introduce Twitter as a subject. School’s founder Virender Sehwag will be taking this class where he will teach kids this very important life skill for today’s world.Sehwag has taken the microblogging platform by storm recently and he will be sharing his wisdom with the students to help them become Twitter influencers in future. Sehwag’s jokes, witty comments and birthday wishes have won him a lot of fans online and now people eagerly await his tweets to see what he comes up with next.This will not be a part of the regular teaching schedule and will be taught in extra classes after the regular closing time. The course will be limited to the senior classes and students below 8th standard will not be allowed to attend.“We have to provide our students with the best possible education to deal with the world out there and social media has become a very important life skill. You can make a living just by using social media these days. Recently, I have been told by many people that I am very good at tweeting so why shouldn’t I share my knowledge with our students?” Sehwag said speaking to our correspondent.The swashbuckling opener further added, “At Sehwag International School, we don’t restrict ourselves to book learning alone, we want to provide all around development of the children, only then they can survive in today’s world. Once they graduate from our school, they can create their Twitter accounts and quickly become Twitter influencers, good money in that job these days. I will RT their first 5 tweets to set them on their way.”Meanwhile, some students also requested for a course on ‘Taking Selfies’ but Sehwag shot that proposal down saying it is not safe as the growing number of deaths due to selfies indicate.
