Following the defection of senior Congress leader Rita Bahuguna Joshi, the party vice president Rahul Gandhi has decided to build a wall around the senior party leaders till the UP elections early next year.The key Congress leaders of the state will be basically confined to four walls of a room in an undisclosed location. They will be devoid of all communications except a hotline with the party headquarters.Rahul hopes this move will prevent the ongoing defection of the party leaders that included the likes of Himanta Biswa Sarma and Vijay Bahuguna to the rival Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) camp. According to sources, he also plans to visit the secret room from time to time to have lunch with those leaders like he does with voters during the election campaign.“Desperate times call for desperate measures,” a Congress worker told The UnReal Times on the condition of anonymity. “This is a proactive measure to stop the leakage of talent from Congress. You see this move should once and for all end the debate on Rahul ji’s leadership.”The Congress is quite relaxed about leaders using mobile phones from within the room to communicate with the outside world. They’re confident about the poor network connectivity of mobile phones in the remote areas of the state.“This is the only occasion when we want to thank the Samajwadi Party for the lack of development in the state,” added the Congress worker sarcastically.The BJP however is not really worried by the Congress’ stealthy move. The party president Amit Shah told The UnReal Times that the Congress leaders interested in joining the BJP need not worry as he can locate them successfully.“I don’t know where you’re. But I will find you and I will induct you in the BJP,” Shah said as he turned the GPS on in his mobile phone.(Originally published on Right to Laughter)
