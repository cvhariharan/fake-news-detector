Barack Hussein Obama has a brother who is three years older than him.  His name is Malik Obama and he is Obama’s half brother. Malik Obama holds different opinions about America than Barack does.  That’s why he’s speaking out.Donald Trump invited Malik to attend the 3rd and final debate in support of him. Malik was thrilled and accepted the invite.  He said,“I’m excited to be at the debate. Trump can make America great again!”Malik — an American citizen who lives in Washington, DC, when he’s not in Kenya blasted Clinton’s performance as secretary of state for exacerbating the chaos and violence in the Mideast. Malik said ousted Libyan leader Moammar Khadafy had been a good friend. “Check out the situation in Libya now,” he said.In Kogelo, Kenya, Malik dedicated and named the Barack H. Obama Foundation to help the poor village their family is from. It’s in honor of his and the Presidents father. Needless to say, President Obama never mentions this foundation but has plenty good things to say about the Clinton Foundation! Malik said,“If I had gotten the support I should have gotten from my brother we would of been better able to help the families village.”Malik last saw his brother Barack in August of 2015 when he visited Kenya.  The relationship between the two brothers seems distant.  He stated, “I went to the White House to say hello. I paid a courtesy call but it wasn’t a very warm and loving reception. As usual, it was a hands-off kind of thing, very businesslike, very formal.”Malik agrees the mainstream media is biased and he doesn’t believe the women who claimed Trump groped them. “I don’t believe them,” Malik said. “Why didn’t they come forward before?”Donald Trump told the press, “I look very much forward to meeting and being with Malik. He gets it far better than his brother.”
