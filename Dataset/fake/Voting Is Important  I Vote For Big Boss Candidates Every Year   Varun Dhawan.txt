Mumbai: Bollywood actor Varun Dhawan was trolled by Twitterati on Tuesday. It all began when Varun couldn’t vote for the BMC elections 2017 as his name was missing from the voter list and came out to issue his statement to the media.He said, “It’s upsetting that I couldn’t find my name on the voter list. My name has not shown up in the list unfortunately, it’s bizarre because I voted last year. Will find out from EC where is my name.”But the controversy has taken a bizarre turn as Varun has apologized for his comments and has said that last year he voted for the Big Boss candidates by sending a SMS. Due to the election season he was confused as to which voting was media referring to and that’s why he said he voted every year.
