Right in the middle of FBI director James Comey letting Congress know that he was reviewing yet MORE emails in relation to the Hillary Clinton investigation, James O’Keefe at Project Veritas released ANOTHER hidden cam video. This one begins with undercover footage from the office of Media Matters, former conservative David Brock’s operation that just happens to be backed by George Soros.  This one is a little different, and allows Roger Stone to get the message out of what is being done to him by the puppetmaster and his minions.Bragging about ruining people’s careers is just…mean.  And getting Lou Dobbs off CNN was a boon to Fox, even if he comes off as naive from time to time.  Glenn Beck off of Fox…no great loss.Of all of the Project Veritas videos to be released, this one may well be the most demonstrative. The actual victims of the organization targeting them get to address the very group that destroyed them. Think what you will of Roger Stone and Alex Jones, but that is powerful. It also proves that the “conspiracy theory” people are being pummeled and defamed most likely to hide their actual message.  If that’s the case, what they have to say may not be so far-fetched after all.Between WikiLeaks (which put out yet ANOTHER cache of Podesta emails today), Project Veritas, and now the FBI reviewing more emails, keeping up with all this news and digesting the scandals less than two weeks before the election is going to be a challenge.  We in the alternative media and blogosphere will do our best to bring all the information to the readers, but it’s not going to be easy.  There’s just too much of it.The October surprises just keep coming, and there is no sign that it’s going to let up any time soon.
