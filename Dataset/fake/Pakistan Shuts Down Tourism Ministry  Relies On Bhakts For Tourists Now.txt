Islamabad: In a twisted set of events, Pakistan has decided to shut down its Tourism Ministry. According to our sources in Islamabad, it will now rely on Bhakts to send people from India regularly to Pakistan, to aid its ailing tourism. It directly accounts for expenditure cuts, and the amount saved has been redirected to Charity foundations run by renowned philanthropists Maulana Masood Azhar and Hafiz Saeed.This sounds strange, but in the last one year, Bhakts from India have found a job under ‘PM Pakistan Bhejo Yojna’ in order to find tourists for Pakistan.Pakistan is easier country to reside, owing to its proven Visa liberties, which was highlighted when Osama was found living there without a Visa for a record 10 years.A year back when Shahrukh was first sent to Pakistan, a lot of his fans reached there to see him, just like they flooded Mannat every year on his birthday. When Aamir left India, similar thing happened. Then Karan Johar reached Pakistan, and he immediately started making movies. His first movie in Pakistan garnered critical acclaim, and was titled- “I am a Hindu and I am not a Kaafir”, though Pakistan did not allow him to release the movie, as it questions secular and peaceful credentials of their respected nation.Soon Salman followed, and their film industry in distress has recovered a bit. Some lesser known names which were sent there started acting in their TV serials, and they are ‘reaching’ India through Subhash Chandra owned Zindagi Channel. Subhash Chandra is the same person who runs National Deshbhakt news channel ‘Chhi News’. People are still waiting for KRK, Tushaar, Rakhi Sawant, Sambhavna, Owaisi, Yogi etc to support Pakistan, so that they can actually send some more people over to Pakistan, and get a sigh a relief from regular bullshit on TV and social media.Jai Hind. Bharat Mata Ki Jai!! (Just proving my Deshbhakti credentials.)
