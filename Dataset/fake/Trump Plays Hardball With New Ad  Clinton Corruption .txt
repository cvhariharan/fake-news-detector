Some political observers would say, “IT’S ABOUT TIME!” that Donald Trump is putting out hard hitting, anti-Hillary advertising in the last week of the presidential election campaign.  In this case, timing may be everything, as well as placement since these ads are running not just at any time of day or night, but during the World Series.  (Given this year’s competitors, the Series has amazingly high ratings.)However, when it comes to the Clintons, and the hubris that leads to scandal and headlines, sometimes waiting until the last moment for maximum impact is the way to go.  That may be the thinking behind the newest ad from Trump and the Republican National Committee.  It’s called “Clinton Corruption” and it hits all the major points.Yes, the Clintons got rich off of their “foundation” that was set up as some sort of money laundering scheme for pay to play politics while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State. Yes, they charged outrageous speaking fees, as prominent people are wont to do, to appear at any number of venues.  Yes, their email system – hers anyway – was illegal for the way it was used.  This is not news.The reality that the FBI is looking into it in five different field offices…that cannot be ignored.My fellow Americans, we are in the home stretch of a brutal election year.  Usually at the end, the campaigns are out of cash and are scraping to actually afford effective advertising in time slots where people will actually see it.  By not spending any cash early, and riding on Mainstream Media coverage – good or bad – Trump now has the cash along with the Republican National Committee to put out the hard hitting stuff.  It’s a different strategy from normal, and far more effective.  Straight out of a marketing textbook, in fact.  (Think the political professionals will notice?  Me neither.)
