In what might be a keep your friends close and your enemies closer move, President-Elect Donald Trump named his first Chief of Staff on Sunday, November 13.  The political appointee is none other than Republican National Committee Chairman, Reince Priebus.In addition to the GOP front man, Trump also named Steve Bannon, executive chairman of Breitbart News  and Trump campaign CEO, as a chief strategist and senior counselor.  From CNN:Video from Newsy.The move to pair these two political operatives from opposite sides of the Republican spectrum is seen as an effort to comfort the GOP rank and file and the nontrusting, Deplorable wing more interested in draining the swamp of Washington, D.C., than preserving any sort of political continuity let over from the previous administrations.Priebus was widely regarded as one of the people who laid the groundwork for a Republican victory for president in 2016 via deconstruction of the 2012 election, and his efforts to hold the party together despite the dissent of many when the primaries produced Trump as the nominee.  Bannon is known to have been one of the two finalists for the Chief of Staff position.  His appointment as a special adviser indicates Trump’s trust in him, and possibly an interest from the Mercer family, owners of Breitbart, who switched allegiance from Sen. Ted Cruz to Donald Trump in the later months of the campaign.Additional staffing decisions are expected in the coming weeks.
