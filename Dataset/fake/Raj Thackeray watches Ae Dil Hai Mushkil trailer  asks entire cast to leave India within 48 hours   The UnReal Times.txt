After threatening Ae Dil Hai Mushkil’s Fawad Khan to leave the country within 48 hours on Friday, MNS chief Raj Thackeray today has asked the entire cast and crew to leave the country within 48 hours.Mr. Thackeray, after issuing the ultimatum to Fawad Khan, realized he had reacted in haste and decided to watch the trailer of the movie to understand the situation better. Hence, he locked himself in his room and secretly played the trailer on YouTube.Two and half minutes later, when he came out of his room, achieving nirvana, he looked visibly shaken and refrained from discussing the experience with anyone. He, however, asked his workers to issue a statement, demanding the ouster of the entire cast and crew of the movie from India within 48 hours.“Movies like Ae Dil Hai Mushkil are the reason why people are losing faith in humanity. Raj couldn’t sleep for three days after watching the trailer and tried to figure out whether it was about a love triangle or a futile attempt to revive Aishwarya Rai’s acting career,” Shalini Thackeray, wife of MNS chief Raj Thackeray, said in a press conference.Shalini, who is the general secretary of MNS, told The Unreal Times that their Chitrapat wing has issued a 48-hour ultimatum to the entire cast and crew of the movie to leave the country.“We would also issue letters to the producers asking them on what ground they hired Aishwarya Rai when there are ample number of actors in the country and struggling to find an opportunity.”“Would you like to specify a name?” we asked.“Her husband, for one.”“But Aishwarya Rai is playing a female character and Abhishek…”“With a bit of make-up, he could easily play the character,” she asserted.We asked Raj Thackeray what MNS would do if they refuse to leave the country and he looked at us blankly for a second before the trailer he’d watched flashed through his mind, “Our workers will push them out before they release the movie,” he screamed on the verge of breaking down.However, Mumbai Police has given an assurance to the production house and said, “Anyone who has a valid document issued by the Government of India need not worry. If Bangladeshi immigrants can live here illegally without any document then why cannot they?”
