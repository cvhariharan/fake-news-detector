I have written enough on the demonetization drive of the government but the ideas keep on ringing my doorbell. 500 Rs and 1000 Rs notes have become redundant now, but there are people who can still make it valuable.One of those persons is renowned director Rohit Shetty. Rohit has decided to write his next Golmaal 4 script on a 500 Rs note. Anyways Rohit Shetty scripts are just 1-2 lines, that’s what his previous scripts have been. 1-2 lines of script and 10-20 cars flying, that’s what precisely is a Rohit Shetty movie.But his new innovation is amazing as we all now that a Rohit Shetty movie will easily earn Rs 100 crores at the box office. He has literally given the 500 Rs note to Ajay Devgn to read the script which of course has been finalized now and Parineeti Chpra will play the lead female in Golmaal Again, as many of us came to know yesterday.
