Former captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s love affair with Chennai continues and it was once again evident when the India wicket-keeper came out to bat during the first ODI against Australia in Chennai on Sunday. But if I tell you that Dhoni’s contribution with the bat won us the match, it would be an insult to the man’s leadership abilities. In the second innings, it was his quick decision making which relieved Kohli off the burden to make decisions as Captain.After letting go captaincy of the ODI team, there were doubts about Dhoni’s place in the ODI set up. But some of his recent performances have put a lid on those openings. In fact, his captaincy skills are still used by India. And yesterday it was relevant enough to say so, after hearing dozens of small clippings through the stump microphone running parallel with match commentary. At each and every juncture where the bowlers were losing their line, Dhoni was quick to transfer tips, change fields, talk to the bowlers and almost every thing that a captain does.In fact the only contribution of Virat Kohli in yesterday’s match was the toss. After that it was pure Dhoni. We have to give credit to the commentator who anchored the presentation ceremony as he could have easily announced Dhoni’s name instead of Kohli’s for having a after-match chat, but he avoided that mistake. Looking at the vast experience MSD carries, Kohli has requested the BCCi to keep all the stump mic recordings in a safe place. These pieces of of information will help him in captaining the side once Dhoni retires. The recordings will also be used by IIMs across the nation to teach leadership skills to management students, HRD minister Prakash Javdekar was heard saying at a press conference.
