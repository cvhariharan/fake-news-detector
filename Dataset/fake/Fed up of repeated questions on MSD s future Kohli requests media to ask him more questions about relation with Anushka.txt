Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s form and future has been under scanner post his Test retirement but a string of limited overs matches in the next three months will enable the former skipper get some momentum and consistency going his way, feels skipper Virat Kohli. Kohli is now too fed up with questions on MSD’s future and wants media to kindly give him a break. In fact in his recent press conference Kohli requested media persons to ask him more about his relationship with Anushka Sharma.The couple has constantly been under public gaze and media scrutiny since their reunion early this year. Anushka has spent more time with the Indian team than Stuart Binny, Karun Nair and Rishabh Pant combined in last 6 months. But still both are quite shy to open up more about their relation. But now with the Dhoni conundrum giving a headache to captain Kohli, he thinks the Anushka connect with help him come out of this catch 22 situation.In his last 10 interviews the first question thrown at  Kohli has been about the future of MSD. So much so that in his recent interview Kohli himself started by answering about MSD even before media threw any question. But ANushka being the true lover that she is has come to the rescue of our aggressive captain. There are rumors that Anushka gave her nod to Kohli about being more vocal about their relationship. Faking News reporter Harneet Ahuja spoke to Kohli in this regard and he had this to say,” Even before you start asking me questions about Dhoni, I want to convey that yes me and Anushka have been quite close and will surely announce something  soon regarding our future.” After this Harneet was left with no chance of asking a subsequent question on MSD’s future.
