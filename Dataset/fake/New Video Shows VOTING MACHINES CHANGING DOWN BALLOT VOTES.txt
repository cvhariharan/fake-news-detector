We knew that the Soros produced voting machines were trouble, but until now, there was no video proof.  Somebody out there in Virginia’s 2nd congressional district took what looks to be cell phone video of a touch screen voting machine CLEARLY changing a vote from the Republican in the race to the Democrat.  Watch:Today in Texas, one county suspended use of voting machines due to reports of straight ticket voting not actually voting straight ticket and down-ticket candidates flipping from Republican to Democrat.  Now, we see this video from the “swing state” of Virginia taken clandestinely by a conscientious voter.This is the case in point for having paper ballots.  When voting on one of these machines, double check that the vote was actually cast for the person you want elected.  The only way elections are going to be honest and officials held accountable is if we all are vigilant about votes cast.
