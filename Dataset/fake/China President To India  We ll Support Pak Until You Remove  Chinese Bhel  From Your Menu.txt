Goa: The recently concluded BRICS summit brought the leaders of 5 big big economies together in their fight against terrorism. There was a consensus related to actions against terrorist outfits.The leaders discussed on all things other than terrorism, that included food, culture, hobbies and future aspirations. The Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has as many as 1 billion pronunciations in India, was very vocal about his distaste for Indian Chinese food. Indians have literally customized the Chinese menu according to their own taste.Some of the famous Chinese food on Indian menu are ‘Gobi Manchurian’, ‘Paneer Chilly’, ‘Chinese Bhel’ and lot more. It’s a surprise that Chinese have no clue about what these fucking dishes are, and Indians are selling it with the brand name of China.Xi Jinping was very furious with the dish name ‘Chinese Bhel’, as it is just a disproportionate mixture of all Chinese ingredients. He strongly condemned the invention of such dishes in India. In fact, he has urged PM Modi to personally look into the matter and ban the dish across India. Once the dish is completely banned in India, China will withdraw its support to Pakistan, he assured.Indians are very attached to the Chinese Bhel, and it seems very difficult to ban it in near future, but with China’s offer of isolating Pakistan, we can very well think of implementing the ban.Or else, we should at least change the name of the dish, for 11 Jinping’s sake.
