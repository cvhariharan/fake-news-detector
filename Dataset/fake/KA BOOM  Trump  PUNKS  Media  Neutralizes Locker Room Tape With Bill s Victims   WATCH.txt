Donald Trump has proven over and over again that he is a MASTER at the news and media game.  On Sunday night in St. Louis, he proved it yet again. According to Neil Cavuto of Fox News, the pool of media people who follow Trump around were led to believe that they were headed to the Four Seasons for a photo op.  Instead, they got a live press conference with The Donald and three of Bill Clinton’s rape victims as well as the victiom of child rape who Hillary Clinton laughed off: Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey, Kathy Shelton and Paula Jones.  (Thanks to Gateway Pundit.)From a few blocks away, in the midst of the land of the moonbats, the Limits household stood and cheered.As it happens, the Four Seasons here in St. Louis is about eight miles from where the debate is happening, north of the Arch on the Mississippi River.  In good traffic, it’s about twenty-five minutes away.  From the photograph, if the room is not the Four Seasons, it looks a lot like the Knight Center, which is a conference center on the campus of Washington University where the debate is happening.  (Could also be the Ritz, which is down the street.)  Plain and simply, the press got punked, and the Clinton campaign – and the DC Uniparty – was outplayed.Consider the locker room talk audio tape neutralized, and the gloves off.  Trump is now playing hardball.  Not only that, dirty mouth talk is NOTHING to legitimate rape.  Nothing.  We the People know that.  So do the media.  And tonight, our alpha male candidate for president made sure everyone out there knows it, too.Bravo, Mr. Trump.  It’s not that often that we get to see someone with brass ones go up against the Clintons and not end up on an internet list.  We the People are enjoying this.
