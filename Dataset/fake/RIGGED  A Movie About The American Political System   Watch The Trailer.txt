The mainline Democrats shrug off Donald Trump’s assessment that the American political system is rigged, but there are many people in the country who agree with him.  One of those people is documentary producer Jeff Hays.  Hays and his team of filmmakers followed Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson around on the campaign trail in 2015 and 2016, and were able to put together a documentary that is sure to confirm Mr. Trump’s astute opinion of the American political system.Their goal with Rigged 2016 is to expose the masses to Johnson and help him to get his poll numbers high enough to be invited to the presidential debates, which right now include only Democratic nominee Clinton and Republican nominee Trump.“The big lie is we only have two choices,” says Byrne. “Let the people compare him to the other two. He’ll mop the floor with them.”Byrne refers to Patrick Byrne of Overstock.com who financed the project with $400 million.  For anyone who has paid attention this year to Gary Johnson and the other third party candidates this political season, the hope of launching Johnson to the White House is a bit of a pipe dream.  No, the choices from the main political parties are not ideal by any means, but neither Johnson or Jill Stein of the Green Party are cut out for the job.However, the main point of the documentary is well taken.  The system as we know it in the United States is rigged.  It is rigged toward established corporate interests who have no interest in anything more than their bottom lines.  The people calling the shots certainly do not have the welfare of the American people, or our mental health, on their list of priorities.And that, ultimately, is the point.
