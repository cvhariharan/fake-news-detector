BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra has shifted to the Republic TV office situated in Lower Parel to save his time spent travelling to the studio for the debate every night.Earlier this month, Sambit had requested Republic TV editor-in-chief, Arnab Goswami, to allot him some space in the office premises so that he can shift there permanently along with his family members.Confirming the news, Sambit said, “It took me a lot of time and effort to travel to Republic TV studio for the debate every day. Arnab and I belong to the same party… oops! I mean, we go to a lot of parties together. So, he had to do me a favour by giving me and my family some space in his office. After all, I have been the most consistent thing on the debate after the noise.” He further added that Arnab has stood by him like a rock, “This is not the first time that Arnab has helped me. Many a times on the debate, he speaks exactly what I intend to, which reduces my responsibilities as a spokesperson of the BJP,” he said, thanking Arnab. Meanwhile, the spokespersons of the Congress party who had allegedly boycotted the Republic TV debates were seen queuing outside the news channel’s office. One of the spokespersons said, “With the high rates of property in Mumbai, it is really difficult to find an appropriate house in the city. We are ready to appear in Republic TV debates again if Arnab allows us to stay in his office like he allowed Sambit,” he said. He clarified that he will not be bringing his family along with him to the office. “My son has frequent exams in his school. Given the high decibels in Republic TV studio, my son will not be able to concentrate in studies,” he said.Arnab confirmed the news when our reporter spoke to him: “IT’S TRUE. I CAN’T REALLY EXPRESS MY EXCITEMENT TO HAVE SAMBIT ONBOARD. THIS IS THE BEST THING THAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME SINCE 2014 AFTER MODI JI’S VICTORY,” he shouted.
