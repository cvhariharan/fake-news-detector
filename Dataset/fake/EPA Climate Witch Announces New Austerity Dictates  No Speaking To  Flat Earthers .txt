This is exactly the next step we’ve expected from the Climate Nazis, forced austerity that destroys America’s standard of living and world status. They seem to be firm in the belief that the global government elites will prevail in the upcoming election, by hook or more likely by crook, and they will have four or eight more years to complete the destruction of our nation.Whatever possesses the demonic little unisex tyrant to believe that she somehow has a right and the power to dictate to “free” Americans their compliance in their own destruction is beyond reason, but she’s doing it. She’s telling some pajama supporter her propaganda as if his agreement with her green authoritarianism somehow makes it legitimate; it’s not. The forces of anti-American destruction embodied by Hussein Obama and Hillary Clinton are not our masters regardless of the excuse or false religion, such as air and dirt worship, that they attempt to use to manipulate us into compliance. That appears to be a fact that will increasingly have to be demonstrated to that for them to understand that they are not our masters; so be it.This disgusting little he-she attempts to psychoanalyze the American people as a tool of persuasion, saying, “People don’t react well when they’re afraid, they tend to think they can’t do anything.” There is nothing about you, you evil little witch, that should inspire any emotion other than disgust, anger, and an appropriate response grounded in the extreme desire to stop you. Only a useless cyber-dork like the human pimple interviewer would find trash like Gina McCarthy or those she serves something to be afraid of. She needs to fear the American people who have had all of this tyranny we’re going to take.The Butch hag says, “And climate will have to not just be what government does but it has to be what people do.” No, Climate is what God does, what the planet does, it is neither what people or the collection of people known as government do. That is the reality whether it be a national government or a corrupt and illegitimate global one. Climate hoax is also not something that the people do voluntarily, it is the result of distortion and manipulation. It is something that is forced upon them by an exploitative cabal of criminal operatives, such as McCarthy, when they are sufficiently complacent to allow themselves to be bullied into submission.
In attempting to persuade those who choose to live primitive, deprived lives in service to the climate change religion, in imposing their beliefs legislatively or by dictate upon the rest of us, McCarthy says, “Individual choices will matter.” Of course she means that only from the standpoint of those who choose obedience to the climate change theology. She adds, “Consumers can make demands. They have always done that and changed markets as a result of it.”
In instructing us to accept their austerity mandates, McCarthy says, “So people have to start living a life that’s commensurate with reductions in greenhouse gases to the extent they can.” She then seeks to bolster her illegitimate authority, saying, “But as you said, demand government to be responsive to this.” That is, tell government that we agree that we must obey unconstitutional globalist dictates. Her perception of “responsive government” is one that dictates submission to its ignorant peasants.
Having recognized that those who have figured out her lies are not going to be manipulated into obedience to her trickery, the little green Nazi demeans those who aren’t led by the nose as does the swollen basement dweller she’s using to promote her propaganda. McCarthy dismisses the self-thinkers saying, “But I would waste no time with ‘climate deniers.’ If they haven’t figured out by now, what in God’s name can anyone say to them that would make them figure it out? The science is overwhelming. I don’t check out flat earth society and I’m not talking to climate deniers, that’s it.”

Just as Obama declared the “science settled” because the facts don’t match up with his declarations, McCarthy has also lost the argument. She’s not going to try to win an argument that has been exposed as fraud and is moving on to the use of brute force and lawless dictates, two Democrat favorites.
They’re going to go full totalitarian in the near future. That’s fine, two can play at that game. If Trump wins the election we’ll have our freedom from this tyranny. If not, we’ll have an enemy that has presented themselves as clearly defined and targeted.
