Sheriff David Clarke did something that not many are willing to do, particularly the treacherous snakes that have hijacked our nation. They won’t identify the enemy, at least not publicly, and never when it comes to their terrorists allies that should be named. Their true enemy is the American patriot, an identification they undoubtedly make multiple times a day in more private settings.Clarke’s not a coward, he is a man of principle who understands the threats facing this nation. He’s willing to identify the enemy and did so in a Saturday morning tweet. Clarke wrote, “It’s incredible that our institutions of government, White House, Congress, DOJ and big media are corrupt and all we do is bitch. Pitchforks and torches time.”The enemy is clearly defined as is the immediate course of action, a taking to the streets by the American people, the “going Egypt” of the American people all over these corrupt elite, banker-type, liberal, Democrat and Republican establishment pieces of crap.Sheriff Clarke went on Fox and Friends to explain what is needed to those who are looking for some direction and leadership. He’s asked, “You said pitchforks and torches time, what do you mean by that?”Clarke says, “I meant the same thing Frederick Douglass, the abolitionist said when he said that the institution of slavery is a system of brute force and it must be fought with its own weapons. I meant the same thing when Barack Obama in 2008, July of 2008 at a fundraiser and talking about how he would deal with Republicans he said, ‘If they pull a knife we’ll pull a gun.'”As Steve Doocy nods in what may be subconscious agreement, Clarke continues, saying, “I said the same thing when during the entire summer we had to listen to Bernie Sanders talk about the need for a revolution in America and the leftist media, Fox not included, Fox News, the leftist media had no problem with that.”.@SheriffClarke: It’s time for ‘pitchforks & torches’ in America pic.twitter.com/xpaTWRZGfd— FOX & Friends (@foxandfriends) October 17, 2016Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.
