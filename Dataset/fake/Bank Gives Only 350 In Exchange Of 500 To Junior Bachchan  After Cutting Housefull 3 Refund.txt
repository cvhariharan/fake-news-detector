But off late directors are not showing faith in his ability to pull in crowds on a friday.But something more embarrassing happened yesterday. Abhishek, who had a single 500 Rs note went to the  nearest bank to exchange it for the new note, but he received only 350 Rs from the bank employee.The reason will shock you but it’s a genuine one. The bank employee had seen Housefull 3 recently at a theater and wanted refund, so he cut 150 Rs, the ticket amount he had spent  while exchanging Abhishek’s 500 Rs note.
