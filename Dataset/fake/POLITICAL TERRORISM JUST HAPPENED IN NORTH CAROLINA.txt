…was the slur spray-painted across an exterior wall of an adjacent building. This show of the hatred coming from the left in Hillsborough, North Carolina, as evidenced by the intentional vandalizing and destruction of property, occurred sometime between Saturday night and Sunday early morning when a perpetrator(s) threw an incendiary device through a window that landed on a couch and a chair in the facility. A GOP official was quoted as saying this was an act of “political terrorism”.Following the bombing, Hillsborough Mayor Tom Stevens issued a statement:“This highly disturbing act goes far beyond vandalizing property; it willfully threatens our community’s safety via fire, and its hateful message undermines decency, respect and integrity in civic participation.”“I believe I speak for the overwhelming majority of people,“ Stevens said, acts like this have no place in our community.”  North Carolina Republican Party executive director Dallas Woodhouse issued a statement as well“Whether you a:re Republican, Democrat, or Independent, all Americans should be outraged by this hate-filled and violent attack against our democracy. Whether the bomb was meant to kill, destroy property, or intimidate voters, everyone in this country should be free to express their political viewpoints without fear for their own safety. We will be requesting additional security at all Republican Party offices and events between now and Election Day to ensure the safety of our activists, volunteers, and supporters.”The GOP office headquarters is a total loss. Republican Party officials in North Carolina will hold a press conference at 6:00 p.m. ET.
