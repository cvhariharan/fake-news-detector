This is just disgusting.We all know that the media is always covering for Democrats, but this takes lying to a whole new level.After the 2nd Presidential debate, CNN was caught telling members of their focus group what to say against Trump. You can hear the host whispering to an African American woman at the beginning of the clip at the 05 second mark….   Now I expect the media to be bias, but CNN was just caught staging the news! The Clinton News Network just couldn’t stand that Trump had an amazing debate performance. CNN even went as far as manipulating their debate poll. They claim that Hillary won the debate 57% 34%.If you dig a little deeper you will see that the only reason they came out with those results was because they over-sampled Democrats nearly 2 to 1. They did the same thing the first presidential debate.After the September 27th debate they released their poll and announced that Hillary won 62% of the vote compared to Trump’s 27%.They plastered their poll all over the internet with the headline “Hillary takes round one!”Too bad that statement isn’t even close to the truth.  CNN only sampled 27% of Republicans in the poll, compared to 74% of Democrats and Independents.  In fact, a staggering 41% identified as Democrat! CNN only sampled 521 people and 3/4 of them were liberal. CNN has lost the little credibility they had left. Share this and expose them for LYING to their viewers and insulting our intelligence!
