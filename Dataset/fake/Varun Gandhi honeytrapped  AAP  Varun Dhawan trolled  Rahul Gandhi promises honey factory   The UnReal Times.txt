As soon as the news that Varun Gandhi may possibly have been honeytrapped and compromised by an arms dealer hit the social media, there was mayhem on AAP’s Twitter handle. Some ignorant of Varun’s political affiliations, assumed he was from AAP considering the nature of charges leveled. They started the customary abusing of the party. As it turned out, Varun was from the ruling BJP. Soon, AAP hit back with double the vengeance and regular queries to PM Modi such as “Will the Modi answer?” and “Is it true?”As the day progressed, the issue was hijacked by Rahul Gandhi who gave it a political twist by promising to get a honey factory built in UP if Congress was voted to power so that no youth in the state was honeytrapped due to lack of honey at home. Soon, Congress foot soldiers from all quarters came to the front explaining Rahul’s statements to control the damage.“Understand the emotion behind Rahul ji’s statement. All he wanted to say was that he would work for the people of UP and not get trapped in scandals. Why this brouhaha?” said a top Congress leader on ‘sibbatical’.A section of twitteratti also trolled Varun Dhawan in confusion. He clarified that the allegations were made for an arms deal and not a Yashraj film deal. Thus, it was more likely that a Gandhi would be involved rather than a Dhawan. A fresh rancor ensued between Congress and BJP supporters subsequently with hashtag #AllDhawansExceptRKDhawan.Yet another busy day on Twitter ended with the good night song from Rajdeep – “Baat nikli hai to door talak jayegi.”
