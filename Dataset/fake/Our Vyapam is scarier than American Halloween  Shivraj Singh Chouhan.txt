New York: On a visit to the US, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan yesterday said that the American festival of Halloween is much less scary than Madhya Pradesh’s very own Vyapam. This is not the first time that CM Chouhan has praised MP during this visit to the US, earlier he had claimed that MP roads are better than the ones he came across in Washington.Halloween is around the corner and preparations are going on in the US ahead of this festival. CM Chouhan has shared some of the images on his Twitter account as well.Speaking at a public event, CM Chouhan said ,”I have seen the preparations for Halloween and I have been really impressed. However, I saw all the scary costumes around and heard a few scary stories from the locals but I wasn’t scared at all since I am from Madhya Pradesh. We have Vyapam there which is much scarier than anything that I have come across during this visit.”“Halloween is celebrated once an year while our Vyapam is being celebrated throughout the year for more than a couple of decades now. That makes it even scarier because you can never relax, you are always wary, it is a never-ending game”, he further added.After looking at some of the pumpkins decorated for Halloween, CM Chouhan commented that Madhya Pradesh has lemons that size.
