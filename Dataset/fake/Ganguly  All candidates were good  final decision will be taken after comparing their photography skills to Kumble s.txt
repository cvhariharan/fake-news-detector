The Indian cricket board (BCCI) on Monday once again found itself surrounded by plenty of drama and controversy when its high profile Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC) withheld the appointment of India’s next senior men’s team coach, saying they needed “a few days more” to make the decision. Explaining the decision, Sourav Ganguly said that there will be a photography test which will decide who will become India’s next coach.The fresh delay in the appointment of a coach comes 47 days after the BCCI invited applications for the role. “What we have decided is that we will conduct a photography skills test as capturing the winning moments is also a necessary qualification of a coach and Kumble used to do it brilliantly. One has to take group photos, make albums and show those photos to players every know and then. This is the secret of good bonding among team members. Even the players have requested us that Kumble paaji used to take their brilliant solo photos, and even the new coach should have those skill sets,” Ganguly saidThis news may not be very exciting for both Sehwag and Shastri as both are not professional enough when it comes to photography. But there are rumors that both will seek guidance from Anil Kumble, the former coach and learn the tricks of good photography. Sehwag has infact purchased a new DSLR and is eager to click some photos soon. Dada also made it sure that there will be a thorough checking of the photos submitted by both,and any photo found to be plagiarized or photo shopped will not be considered for final selection. Leading DSLR sales representatives have a task on their hands to convince both candidates for using their brand of Cameras as big incentive packages are at stake.
