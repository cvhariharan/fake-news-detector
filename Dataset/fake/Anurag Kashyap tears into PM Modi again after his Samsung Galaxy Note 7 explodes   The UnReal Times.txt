Bollywood director Anurag Kashyap, who tore into PM Modi over the theatre owners association’s decision to boycott screening films with Pakistani artistes in them, is at again.Serving a volley of angry tweets to the PM, Kashyap thundered, “@narendramodi Time for you to apologize again sir. My Samsung Galaxy Note 7 just exploded this morning. Why are you doing this to me? You also use a smartphone and haven’t had any problems. Why is it us who are always on the receiving end? As if it wasn’t enough that Lunchbox didn’t win the Oscar, or the Nobel. BTW, Bharat Mata ki Jai.”Kashyap’s rant drew instant praise from Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal. “Proud of u fellow AK. Today it is a Samsung phone. Tomorrow it’ll be the entire country if this psycopath has his way,” the AAP chief claimed.AAP spokesperson The Ashutosh too, spoke up in support of the director. “Hats off to the Cashyup’s cowrage! Will the Modi answer?” the former IBN7 editor tweeted.While the BJP leadership is yet to respond to Kashyap’s second rant, it’s media-nominated spokesperson, the VHP’s Sadhvi Prachi asked Kashyap to go to Pakistan if he didn’t want his phone to explode. “Everything else around him will, though,” the Sadhvi stated.Sports Minister Vijay Goel stated that he’d like a selfie with Kashyap before responding to him.BJP MP Shatrugan Sinha spoke in favor of his Bollywood colleague, stating that there was nothing wrong in asking questions to the PM, but that it won’t do any harm if the PM responded. “To the best of my knowledge, I’ve not told Modi Bhai KHAMOSH! So I see no reason why he shouldn’t speak up,” the Shotgun stated.
