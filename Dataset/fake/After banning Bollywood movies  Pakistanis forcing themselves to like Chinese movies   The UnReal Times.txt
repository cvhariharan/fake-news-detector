Pakistan army may be blowing hot and cold over the Indian surgical strikes – blustering quite a bit about retaliation for the Indian surgical strikes, but not actually doing anything about it on the ground – but the war in the realm of movies has escalated rapidly.On the heels of the Indian Motion Pictures Producers Association (IMPPA) decision to ban Pakistani actors and technicians from working in the Hindi film industry, the Pakistani government has banned Indian films in cinemas across their country. Pakistan’s army chief General Raheel Sharif has appealed to the people of Pakistan to instead watch movies made by China.“No longer will Bollywood screw with the minds of Pakistani youth with SRK chick flicks, Ram Gopal Varma and Houseful sequels. Enough of hawkish India’s treachery. We will only watch movies from our all our all weather friend, China!” announced General Raheel Sharif while addressing a seminar relating to the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).Heeding their leader’s call, regular Pakistanis are attempting to take to Chinese movies. 27 year old Altaf Raza, an unemployed man from Islamabad, who was hitherto obsessed with Bollywood, bought several DVDs of Chinese movies and forced himself to watch them every day.Imran Alam, a resident of Peshawar, took to Ip man movies and let a volley of fast air-punches at his goat, before being head-butted and chased around by the annoyed animal.“Samaj me to kuch nahi aa raha hai lekin, Chinese cinema dekhna nahi chorunga. Bahut dekh liye Bollywood, ab bas, Bollywood ko bata denge hum bhi kya cheez hai, Inshallah! [I can't understand anything, but I won't stop watching Chinese movies. Enough of Bollywood. We'll show them what we are, Inshallah!]” said Altaf.
