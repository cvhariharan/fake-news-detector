New York- A shocking number that raises question over misplaced priorities of humans, a latest research revealed today that overall PR budget of entire planet earth crossed  a whopping $400B last year. This means, earth spent more money than its entire health, food and education budget combined to improve its image in the solar system and beyond.It’s not yet clear who our planet wanted to impress, but experts say it was necessary considering rapidly falling habitabilty on this plant, that, if known to outside worlds, would be enough to discourage any alien interest in settling down here, lowering our self esteem and hurting our ego.When asked if that much amount could have better spent improving condition back here, so the PR wasn’t required in the first place, the expert replied- the damages we’re doing to earth are unjustifiable, irreversible and an ‘evil necessity’, hence the only option left for us is to publicize to outside worlds that we’re not actually doing those terrible things. They just happen on their own.
