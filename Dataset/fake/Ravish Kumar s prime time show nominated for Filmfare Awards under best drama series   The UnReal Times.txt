Ravish Kumar’s prime time show has been nominated for the Filmfare Awards under the category of best drama series. The Filmfare Awards Committee has unanimously decided to nominate the show after watching the thought-provoking episode titled ‘Are we to stop questioning?’ which was aired last night.During the screening of the show on NDTV India, viewers across India witnessed cinematographic brilliance, portraying the unjust system we live with, and Ravish Kumar, who previously produced the cult classic ‘The Dark Screen’ has once again won millions of hearts with his powerful performance.Although the show was primarily aimed at raising awareness about freedom of expression and highlighting the fascism that prevails in Modi’s regime, the jury members were particularly impressed by the dramatized presentation of the show by the immensely creative Ravish Kumar.The show opens with toxic air engulfing the city of Delhi, a metaphor for the oppression we have been subjected to, where the oppressor menacingly walks on the streets, keeping an eye on each and every individual.A couple of mime artists appear on the screen in the next segment and beautifully portray the ugly truth that we as a society should be ashamed of, a horrifying reality that most of us were unaware of.“The views are not only factually incorrect but also irrelevant to the issue he is trying to address,” one of the peons at The Times Group office raised an objection while serving tea to the jury members, “Isn’t this show supposed to be about the ban imposed on NDTV? The channel has been asked to go off air for leaking sensitive information but he is completely digressing here and talking about an imaginary authority that punishes those who question its actions.”“That’s called creative liberty, my friend,” asserts the jury member.The jury will decide the winner by the end of this month and the award will be formally presented at 62nd Britannia Filmfare Awards to be held next year.Meanwhile, TV production houses were queuing up to rope in Ravish Kumar for their next ventures after watching his show, but Balaji telefilms has apparently won the race. Sources revealed that he could be seen in the upcoming season of Kumkum Bhagya.
