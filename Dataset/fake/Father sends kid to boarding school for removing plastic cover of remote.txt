You may have heard of parents sending their kids to boarding school to teach them discipline or to make them independent or other personal reasons. But what happened with Parthiv Gupta, a 16-year old kid, will astonish you. Parthiv’s father, Mr. Rajesh Gupta, has sent him to boarding school for removing plastic cover of their TV remote. Yes, you read it right!Rajesh’s neighbor, Mr. Sanjay Sharma, called us to narrate the incident hoping that media spotlight would make Rajesh change his decision. We interviewed Rajesh and here’s what he had to say.  “Before you judge me or label me as a strict father or give me names such as Hitler Qureshi or tell me to watch movies like Taare Zameen Par and 3 idiots, I would like to say that we are middle class people. Not upper middle class. Not lower middle class. We’re the exact middle of middle class. We are so middle class that we are using belan (rolling pin used in kitchen) since last 20 days to remove paste. We live on 3 things – food, water and EMIs. My son Parthiv very well knows that most of the things we have in the house are second hand. And if there is something that is new, we first worship it for at least 6 months and try to keep it as new as possible for however long we can,” he said. “Just 2 months ago, we bought a new TV after saving for 10 months. And when I came home 3 days ago, I was stunned to see that Parthiv had removed the cover of the TV remote. You go and ask any middle-class family what the remote cover means to them. It is sacred for us. Parthiv clearly lacks the basic fundamentals of a middle class family so I have sent him to an affordable boarding school where they’ll teach him how to value things such as remote covers. So if you want to call me names I’m fine with it, but it is for my son’s own good,” he added.This is when our reporter accidentally broke a glass kept on the table. Mr. Rajesh transformed into a hulk and we had to leave before he could grab us.
