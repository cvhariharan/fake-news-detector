From the sets of The Kapil Sharma Show, Mumbai: With elections approaching faster now in Punjab, and EC having announced the dates, Everyone finally felt a sigh of relief and expected Sidhu to formally announce the Political outfit which is supposedly going to take Kapil Sharma’s place in his life.On whose joke’s he is going to laugh for next five years? On whose tunes will he dance? In whose favor is he going to say all his strong worded poems?But the wait is getting longer and longer.From the time he left BJP, he has done it all. From announcing a new political outfit, to joining AAP. Then from going independent to joining Congress.Apparently, BJP, also called Bhartiya Jumla Party by its loved ones’, was the party tailor made for Sidhu, with all his one liners, that can also be touted as Jumlas he built to disgrace the party.With polling dates getting announced, curiosity of young India reached  its pinnacle, and everyone was expecting an announcement any day.In a strange turn of events however, it is learnt that Sidhu has requested Election commission to postpone the dates by some tenure, till he decides in on the political party he may join.EC is learnt to have asked for the expected timelines they needed to reschedule the elections.Our reporter Mr. Chatur Khujli also touched base with Mr Navjot singh Sidhu to ask him how much time he needs. “Till The Kapil Sharma show gets over, Thoko Taali”.
