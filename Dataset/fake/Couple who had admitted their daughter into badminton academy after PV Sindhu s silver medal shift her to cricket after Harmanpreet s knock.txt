Harmanpreet Kaur created history on Thursday for Indian cricket when she scored an unbeaten 171 runs from 115 balls with 20 fours and seven sixes coming in her rapid fire inning that thumped the Australian attack. The knock gave immense happiness to most Indians, except Bharti, who was an upcoming badminton player. Her parents shifted her to cricket today morning and her dream of becoming a top notch badminton player vanished in a span of  minutes.Bharti, who is 14 years old, was never into sports as a child. But PV Sindhu’s silver medal at the Olympics changed her life. Her parents admitted her into a badminton academy in Hyderabad with the hope that one day she will also emulate Sindhu. Bharti always dreamed of becoming a doctor, but then who cares about a child’s dream in India. Bharti’s parents were continuously glued to news channels on the day of Sindhu’s victory and learnt that there are some good academies in India. That is when they admitted Bharti into one of them, in the next morning. Though not her area of interest, Bharti had started to take liking for the game and her game was developing pretty well.But Harmanpreet’s magical knock yesterday changed everything. Bharti’s parents heard many neighbors who were discussing about putting their daughters into cricket academies. Then what, a seat at a cricket academy in Hyderabad was booked and Bharti was shifted there overnight. Bharti who has never played cricket before in her life, found it difficult to understand the game, but is giving her best to live her parents’s dream of making her an elite cricketer, only until another female athlete wins something big in some other sport.In fact no of academies giving coaching to budding female talent has increased overnight and that is not such a great news for Badminton.
