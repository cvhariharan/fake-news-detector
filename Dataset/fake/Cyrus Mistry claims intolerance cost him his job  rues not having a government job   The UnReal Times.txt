Outgoing chairman of Tata Sons, Cyrus Mistry, who was ousted from his position a few days ago has claimed that the increasing intolerance in the country was the reason he was fired.In an exclusive interview with The Unreal Times, Mistry explains to us in detail about his sacking.“It’s all because of the rising intolerance levels in the country. People have become intolerant of the success of others. People are so intolerant that they can’t even tolerate winning their own award and are giving it back. Tell me, when people are returning their awards due to intolerance, isn’t it obvious that Ratan sir will return to his old post? India is so intolerant that they can’t see someone outside the family taking charge of the organisation,” he said, sipping on a cup of Tata Coffee.“There is so much intolerance that there is no job security,” he went on to add. “I should have listened to people and taken a Government job. Now I’m too old for that too. Isn’t this also a form of intolerance? Where we don’t allow a 48 year old man to join a bank as a clerk?”When asked what he planned to do, he said that he’d return something in protest.“Since the only thing I can return right now is to return to my old job, so I will go back to Shapoorji Pallonji for now. But I will return from there as well to Tata someday,” he reiterated.Meanwhile, Aam Aadmi Party leader, The Ashutosh, tweeted out, “Why has the Sirus Maistri been fired? Who will host Barka now? Will The Modi answer?”
