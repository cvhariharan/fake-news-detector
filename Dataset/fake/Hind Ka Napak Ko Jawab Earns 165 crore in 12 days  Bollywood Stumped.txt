Sirsa: When the clash of titans happened on 25th Jan, people were asking which movie will be the first one to reach 200 crore. Not many understood that day a bigger clash was waiting just round the corner. It did happen on 10th of Feb when MSG Babaji came face to face with Akki Baba. Even his wife Twinkle was not sure who will be the one she will root for, but writing was on the wall. None of the three movies were able to do what Baba ji’s Hind Ka Napak Ko Jawab (view rating on IMDB) did in just 12 days.A whooping 165 crore, without even having those many theaters playing it. It is so sure now that it has something supernatural or divine, if you may call so, which has helped the movie Hind Ka Napak Ko Jawab gallop such a phantom amount. After these collections, SRK who gave a success bash after Raees reached 100 crore, is asking refund from people who attended the bash.Aditya chopra, whose movie Befikre recently was not able to reach 100 crores, even after releasing the movie in 6000 screens has contacted Babajee for his next one.
