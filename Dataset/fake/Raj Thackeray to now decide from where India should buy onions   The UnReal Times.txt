After successfully resolving the Ae Dil Hai Mushkil row, the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray will now take a call for India on the import of onions.The feisty politician will reportedly chair a meeting in Mumbai where he will take a tough decision on the import. Since Thackeray made it easier for the central government in dealing with the Pakistani artistes’ row, the cabinet ministers may not attend the crucial meeting.The government is quite confident that the MNS chief will resolve this issue too and that they will know of his final decision later through his press conference.Explaining Thackeray’s keenness on onions, one MNS leader said, “The issue of onions is an emotive one. How can we eat onions imported from enemy countries? In a way, it will mean the enemy made us weep as we peeled their onions. We can never have the enemy gain such a psychological edge.”If the onion decision too bears fruit, the MNS may seriously consider floating a Foreign Affairs department which will help the Indian government take decisions on outstanding issues like trade deficit with China, track two diplomacy with Pakistan, Iran gas pipeline deal, foreign-exchange reserves, etc.The Congress took this opportunity to mock the central government over its inability to take tough decisions on foreign affairs.A Congress spokesperson told The Unreal Times, “Prime Minister Narendra Modi is wasting a lot of tax payers’ money by travelling the world to strike international deals. All he should do is meet Raj Thackeray often instead of meeting world leaders like Obama or Putin. This is the first time that we have found the answers to our external problems inside the country itself.”Meanwhile Ae Dil Hai Mushkil director Karan Johar was seen doing the rounds of Thackeray’s home again. This time the filmmaker wanted to know which are the right brands of firecrackers to buy for Diwali . He was reportedly heard joking, “You know I am making sure I get this one right. Otherwise, Yeh Diwali hai mushkil.”(Originally published on Right to Laughter)
