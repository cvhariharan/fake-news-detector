Dinesh Chandimal-led Sri Lanka are on the brink of a series whitewash in the third and final Test against India commencing on August 12. So far in the series, injury-stricken Sri Lanka have failed to tick the right boxes. India has been totally dominant in the series and now they feel that this series was a complete waste for them. Instead they could have scheduled a series with a stronger team.BCCI has been criticized for organizing such series when the Indian team is number one in tests and should compete with the stronger teams. The only people watching the India Lanka series are the people who don’t have jobs or are not interested in searching a job for themselves. One such fan Mr. Sanil Jain spoke to our Faking News reporter and he had this to say,” Look, there are so many advantages in watching the Ind-SL series. Some days back I was finding it hard to get proper sleep. That is when the doctor prescribed the Ind-SL series, and now am able to sleep for hours and hours. Also, after coming  to know that I am a regular watcher of the Ind-Sl series, no relatives make plan to visit me any time soon. What more can I ask from God. I Hope the BCCI keeps on organizing such series in future also.”BCCI meanwhile did call a press conference to clarify that it was indeed a brain fade moment for them when they were scheduling this series. They have also promised that they will not repeat such mistakes and be extra cautious while planning future tours to cricketing nations. Government meanwhile has decided to use the viewership data of the ongoing series to calculate the unemployment figures for the last two months.
