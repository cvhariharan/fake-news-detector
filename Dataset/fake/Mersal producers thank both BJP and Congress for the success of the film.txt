Do you know that we spend about 25% of the movie’s budget on the promotions alone. When Mersal hashtag runs across all the news channels, local and national, we are overjoyed. When we hear about the @OfficeOfRG’s tweet, supporting the film goes viral, we plan to release the movie in Russia and Kazakhstan”, she further added.Meanwhile, the producers of ‘Indu Sarkar’ are planning on a re-release of the movie, owing to the sudden popularity of the movie, thanks to non-stop TV debate fights between Congress and BJP.
