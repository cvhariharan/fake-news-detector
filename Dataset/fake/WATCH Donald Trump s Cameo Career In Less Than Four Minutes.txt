Plain and simply, Donald Trump is a master of mass communication.  That has become obvious as the 2016 presidential election season has progressed.  What few appreciate is what it took for him to get there.  Yes, there is natural talent involved, but over the decades, The Donald has honed that natural talent to a sharp edge.Part of that training, and something that added tremendously to his name recognition prior to throwing his hat in the presidential ring, was the number of Cameo appearances on television sit-coms and dramas and in movies over the years.  Thanks to YouTube channel CH2, we now have a compilation.Let’s see what we have here:Okay, so I skipped over professional wrestling.Still, though, some of the very people in the cameos where Donald Trump can be found are the celebrities who are dead set against the idea of his candidacy, and who will tell the world and any one else who will listen what a horrid man he is, and that they will be leaving the United States if he is elected.Uh-huh.For decades Donald Trump has been in the public eye and never before – not even when he was mingling with anyone who is anyone in Hollywood – have complaints against him been raised as they have in the last few weeks.  The accusations are beyond transparent, and are wearing very thin.Donald Trump gave a face to a movement that began years ago when the American people were betrayed by our leadership, and anti-American taxes and legislation were passed by Congress.  All along the way, we’ve been gaslighted and lied to by the mainstream media as well.  We get that.  The people in the swamp in Washington, D.C., do not want to admit that we know this.  Now is our time to make a statement that cannot be ignored.
