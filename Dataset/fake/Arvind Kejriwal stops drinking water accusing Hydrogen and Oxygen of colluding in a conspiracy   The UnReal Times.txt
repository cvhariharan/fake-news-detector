In a completely unsurprising development, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has now stopped drinking water, accusing Hydrogen and Oxygen of being in a conspiracy. “Sab mile hue hain ji!” he hollered, adjusting the flowers in his hair.A distraught Mrs. Kejriwal was heard telling her friend, “He’s long stopped drinking tea because of Modi and now with this new water-phobia, I’m worried he’ll dehydrate. He’s already showing the signs. His coughing has become dry and his index-finger has swollen up.”“I took him to my uncle who is a renowned homeopath, but there too, without any provocation, my husband pointed his finger at my elderly uncle and called him a psychopath! I’ve never seen Uncle ji so upset. Hai Ram… Ab main kya karoon?” she wailed.Meanwhile, in a show of support, senior party-members Ashutosh and Sisodiya have taken to drinking their whiskies neat.“Will the Modi answer why his agents Haider-jan and Oksi-jan are conspiring against the Kajariwal?” tweeted The Ashutosh.
