NEW DELHI- Amidst all the controversy surrounding the powers of the LG of Delhi, Delhi-ites today woke up to some cheering news. In a grand function yesterday, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that “Sent from my Iphone”, the tagline at the end of an e-mail sent from an iPhone, would replace Delhi state’s official state slogan up until this point “Janta hai mera baap kaun hai?’’Our reporters took to the streets to find out what the Aam Aadmi (mango man), thought of this development.“It’s a takeover of English of our civilization. I remember the good old days, when Janta hai mera baap kaun hai?, was more than enough to threaten somebody into not filing corruption charges against you” reminisced long-time Delhi resident and former corrupt government official, Sachin Co-Pilot“I feel this is a good move, as it promotes Swach Bharath, since iPhones have clean displays, Make In India, since this will attract Apple to come to India, and remove people’s attention from demonetisation. Think of our soldiers fighting at the border. Btw, do you have change for 2000?”-BJP supporter and Narendra Modi super-fan, Pappu“Delhi state has a slogan? That’s so, like, cool man. Let me snapchat this.”-the proudly uneducated youth of Delhi
