4th Nov,2017. After the derailment of trains, another case of carelessness from Indian Railways has come to light. A defective tomato sachet caused havoc in the life of a 26-year old girl, Sukriti, going to her home. When Sukriti got seated in chair car bogie of Malpua Express, she had no idea of what is going to happen in this journey.Sukriti received morning tea around 7 am in the morning, moments after she got seated. After about an hour, she got her breakfast. Please note that we have been giving Rajdhani and Shatabdi trains, an extra penny for this meal since decades. After finishing the breakfast, unable to make space for the sauce in her stomach, Sukriti decided to put that sachet in her bag where all other sachets have been stored from previous visits at various places.What happened thereafter, will blow your mind and make you cry. Keep tissues handy. After about an hour, when she opened the bag for putting another sachet of jam to store at the same place, she found leaked sauce scattered all over her bag. It took a good 30 minutes before she could restore back the situation.Such incidents show the carelessness of Indian Railways and also highlight the plight of passengers .Railway authorities should take this matter into serious hands, before it impacts the life of another Sukriti.
