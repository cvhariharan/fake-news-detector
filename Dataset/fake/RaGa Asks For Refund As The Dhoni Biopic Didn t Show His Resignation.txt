The BJP has alleged that Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi violated the model code of conduct by “co-relating the Congress election symbol with religious figures”.But that’s not all what Rahul Gandhi did this week. He, in fact was very sad that MSD resigned from ODI captaincy, but that was not the sole concern for his sadness. In fact he was sad that the producers didn’t show the resignation part in the Dhoni biopic.Rahul Gandhi thought that whatever shown in the movie is the whole life of Dhoni and no big decision will be taken in future regarding his playing career, and he will keep playing and captaining for ages. To his shock, MSD resigned from the post of captaincy just recently.
