According to sources, Republic TV has become a new addiction among people. Its 24 hours Exclusive news is not allowing anyone to leave their seat. Mr. Chandan, who works as a content writer in Buzzpoop, had taken a week’s leave when Republic was aired for the first time. He has now asked his office canteen in-charge to resign after he refused to play Republic TV during lunch hours.Faking News reporter spoke to Chandan, who said, “Republic has done what no other channel has ever done; it shows Exclusive news even at midnight. The fearless attack on opposition has never been done by anyone else. All other news channels target only the incumbent government. I had an altercation with my office canteen in charge and I have no regrets. I have learned debating skills from Arnab and I am glad that I got the chance to use them.”It’s not even a month and Arnab’s Republic TV has gained maximum TRP. BARC data shows that Republic TV has captured 52% market share in just a week’s time. Journalist-turned-boxer, Rajdeep Sardesai has called BARC sold out. Arnab took a jibe at Sardesai and called his statement an irony. Arnab later conducted a prime time debate on Rajdeep Sardesai’s statement “BARC sold out” with 30 panelists. Hashtag for the debate was #RajdeepAuctionedCM Arvind Kejriwal has also accused Arnab for tempering with the BARC Data. Kejriwal questioned, “A few days back NDTV allegedly claimed to have the highest TRP among all the news channels then how come Republic TV became the number 1 channel?”What Chandan has demanded is certainly not correct, but “allegedly” sold out news media houses have certainly raised a valid question. Which channel to show in office canteen and at various public places as news channels affect people’s perception.
