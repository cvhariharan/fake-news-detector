After many speculations about the release of the much-awaited Rajasthani folk from Padmavati—Ghoomar—the song was finally released on Wednesday, much to the delight of the fans.More than the filmmakers and people associated with the film, members of the Rajput Karni Sena had prepared themselves for the mega event. In an attempt to find mistakes in the song, the community ended up making it the most viewed song within an hour after its release. Immediately after the launch of the song, members of the community logged in to watch the song in order to find mistakes and stall the release of the film. In the process of doing so, the members watched it several times, which added to the total number of views on the song on YouTube. This did not just result in enormous traffic on YouTube but also helped the song break all records in terms of viewership. Sanjay Leela Bhansali, the director of Padmavati was ecstatic on seeing the increasing number of views, and said, “I have figured out the formula to make hit films. After making headlines throughout the shoot of Padmavati, I have decide that all my future films will be based on the Rajput community so that it remains in limelight.”Members of the Rajput Karni Sena, who could not find any errors in the song, were left red-faced after they realised that they made it the most-viewed song on YouTube within an hour after its release. Aggrieved, the members staged protests and vandalised public property in Mumbai to cause harm to Sanjay Leela Bhansali. “Bhansali has used us to get views on Ghoomar. Now, we’re offended again and we promise to not let his film release,” said an angry member of the Rajput Karni Sena, before torching a BEST bus to take revenge from Sanjay Leela Bhansali.
