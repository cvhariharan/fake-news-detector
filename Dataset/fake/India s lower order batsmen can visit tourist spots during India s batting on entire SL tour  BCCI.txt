In a move favouring the players of the Indian cricket team, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced that the lower-order batsmen in the team can visit the tourist attractions in Sri Lanka during India’s batting in the ongoing Sri Lanka tour. The move was shortly announced after the first test at Galle, where several lower-order batsmen complained of not getting the opportunity to bat.The lower order of the Indian batting line-up was seen protesting outside the BCCI headquarters in Mumbai during the second innings of the Indian batting. “We will bowl our hearts out twice in the ongoing match and won’t get to bat properly even once. Is this gully cricket?” said a furious lower-order batsmen at the request of anonymity. He further suggested that BCCI should come up with an alternative for the lower-order batsmen to kill time during India’s batting. BCCI later announced that the lower-order batsmen can visit the tourist spots in Sri Lanka. “The cricketers have complained that they cannot go to vacations as we make them play the entire year. Hence, it is desirable that they visit the tourist spots on their official tour,” said a BCCI spokesperson. Following the decision, there are rumours of a fallout between the top order and the lower order of the Indian batting lineup. This was evident after pacer Umesh Yadav uploaded pictures of him vacationing on a Sri Lankan beach. “Dhawan bhai did not ‘like’ my pictures on Facebook. He’s upset that he cannot visit the beaches while I can,” said Yadav, hinting at the fallout. Skipper Virat Kohli was happy with the Board’s decision and termed it as a ‘progressive move’. “I don’t want to go to the beach. If I bat twice, I’ll score more runs and only break more records of Sachin paaji,” said a seemingly enthusiastic Kohli.
