It’s back to the future for George Orwell fans and those who understand that Walter Cronkite was a communist.  The current Occupier of the Oval Office, Barry Soetoro, aka Barack Obama, has declared that the wild, wild west of American media should cease to exist.  Instead of a mish mosh of facts, truth, and decried “conspiracy theories” that are turning out to be more and more credible, we the people should look to some sort of fact curating function:“We are going to have to rebuild within this wild-wild-west-of-information flow some sort of curating function that people agree to,” Obama said at an innovation conference in Pittsburgh.“There has to be, I think, some sort of way in which we can sort through information that passes some basic truthiness tests and those that we have to discard, because they just don’t have any basis in anything that’s actually happening in the world,” Obama added.Call it what you will, Ministry of Truth, Pravda, Double Speak, Office of Propaganda, Obama and whoever is pulling his puppet strings would like a return to the days when the most trusted man in America was a communist and the “news” media regularly blew smoke, rainbows and unicorns up the people’s backsides.Yeah, Barry, those days are over.“That is hard to do, but I think it’s going to be necessary, it’s going to be possible,” he added.“The answer is obviously not censorship, but it’s creating places where people can say ‘this is reliable’ and I’m still able to argue safely about facts and what we should do about it.”Considering that all sides will present their cases in the best light, what is truth in the realm of politics can be subjective.  Until it becomes iron-clad objective, only communicating what you want the people know is called censorship.  Last time any of us in the USA looked at the law of the land, from the government, unless national security is involved, that is illegal.BTW, Google launched a new feature today: Fact Check.  It’s probably as reliable as the search algorithms that never seem to give conservative sites and opinions on the first three pages.
