Those of us cursing Jack Dorsey on Friday, October 21, should retract.  Twitter.com was one of several websites affected when a cyber attack at Dyn, an upstream domain name system company, made a mess out of service.  From Mashable.Writing on its website, Dyn said that starting at about 7 a.m. EST, the company “began monitoring and mitigating a DDoS attack against our Dyn Managed DNS infrastructure. Some customers may experience increased DNS query latency and delayed zone propagation during this time. Updates will be posted as information becomes available.”The attack was resolved by 9:20 a.m. EST, but not before causing service disruptions for a number of popular websites:The attack resulted in DDoS or distributed denial of service messaging for a variety of sites that did not discriminate:“Hackers have no rules. One of the problems we have is that they move much faster than cyber-defenders. A DDoS attack can be launched in literally seconds, or under an hour if it’s coordinated by a larger group,” Steven Morgan, founder of the research firm Cybersecurity Ventures, told Mashable. “Right now, we’re in the phase of figuring out where did this come from.” …“The internet continues to rely on protocols and infrastructure designed before cyber security was an issue.  DDoS, especially with the rise of insecure IOT devices, will continue to plague our organizations,” Ben Johnson, a chief security strategist for Carbon Black, told Mashable. “Sadly, what we are seeing is only the beginning in terms of large scale botnets and disproportionate damage done.”
