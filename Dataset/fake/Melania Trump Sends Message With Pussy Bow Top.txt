In a sure sign that the people of the American political scene are up against a pair of opponents who aren’t going to cower in a corner, during her husband’s masterful thrashing of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton at this season’s second 1 on 3 debate in St. Louis, Melania Trump got in her two cents without saying a word.  She wore a hot pink, all prissy missy top with what people who know fashion call “a pussy-top bow.”  Looking just as cool, calm and gorgeous as ever, she then shook  Bill Clinton’s hand.  [CAN’T TOUCH THIS.]Genius.Those of us who lived through the 1980s remember the pussy bow as a staple of the wardrobe, not that we knew what it was called in fashion terms.  No, we just wore them because Margaret Thatcher did.  As of 2014, designers started to reintroduce the feature on the runways.  Now Donald Trump’s wife, a former model, and a very self-assured and accomplished women, wore one in the midst of her husband’s defense from the self-righteous puritans of American politics for a doctored tape of a locker room conversation where he confessed to striking out while trying to seduce a woman, and calling women’s privates the pet nickname for a cat.  (Yes, only in America.) From Breitbart:The Gucci “pussy-bow” blouse retails at Net-a-Porter.com for $1,100. The site’s editors note: “Pussy-bow shirts are one of Gucci’s signature silhouettes. New for Pre-Fall ’16, this fuchsia style is cut from silk crepe de chine for a languid drape. We think it’s a chic way to elevate office or weekend looks.”Mrs. Trump matched the blouse with a set of fuchsia slacks.After the debate, Melania Trump greeted Bill Clinton — wearing her pussy-bow, of course.The Trump campaign claims that the pussy bow outfit was “unintentional.”  For a women who has yet to appear in anything other than a dress or a skirt with no collars and low cut necklines, she suddenly wears pants and a top tied right under her chin in a practically glow in the dark color?  Ri-i-i-ght.
