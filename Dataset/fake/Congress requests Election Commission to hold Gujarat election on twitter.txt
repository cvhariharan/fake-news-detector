Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh elections are nearing and Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi is taking them very seriously atleast on social media. Rahul Gandhi is mixing humour and sarcasm in his tweets and getting a lot of attention and likes.Though Rahul Gandhi has been able to improve his social media image but his fans are yet to see his improved real life image that doesn’t seem to be happening anytime soon. And that’s one of the reasons Congress has requested to conduct Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh assembly elections on Twitter.Congress spokesman and mentor of Rahul Gandhi, Ajay Maken in a press conference on Tuesday revealed that Congress President Sonia Gandhi has written a letter to Election Commission requesting Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh assembly elections to be held on Twitter.After Election Commission refuses to do so Congress accused Election Commission of being biased and also called Modi coward. CM Arvind Kejriwal has also supported Congress’ proposal and has said that conducting election on Twitter will also reduce the chances of EVM hacking.BJP hasn’t yet responded on the issue but seeing the various trolls being fans of PM Modi, BJP will not have any objection to Congress’ request.Sources say that Rahul Gandhi’s social media team has now hired a new person who not only writes tweets for him but also tells him what to reply to trolls. “Rahul Gandhi can get his tweets written by someone else but speeches he has to deliver himself and that’s where he gets exposed” tweeted one of the social media users.
