Mumbai: In recent time, writing satires has become quite rewarding. First the jobless, worthless people found money to buy tea from a local tea stalls by writing these satires. Next, they have set their eyes on purchasing bungalows like Antilla. From 5 Rs credits, local vendors have started giving them credit worth 15 Rs. monthly. Their career path lays perfectly laid out in front of them.With so much money involved, it was bound to find some haters (These are the guys who still survive on the credit limit of Rs. 5, hence jealous) who would want to distract them.When they write an article on Modi, Bhakts fill up the comment boxes with abuses.When they write an article on Kejriwal, Aapians tear them apart, without any logic obviously.When they write an article on Congress, Congress’s come back saying facts can’t be presented as satires. Anyways leave them now.Frustrated that they can’t write on anyone famous, the association has decided to lend support to an independent candidate for the next PM elections. The reasons, when inquired about, was straightforward. She is the only one whose supporters even don’t mind for writing articles on her. you can go to any level, she has tolerance more than any politician/actor/industrialist. She should have been the role model for our audience.Its time India takes the next big step and choose Her as the next PM, so that our successful journey continues, and at least one of us can buy Antilla model from Chandni Chowk worth Rs. 100.
