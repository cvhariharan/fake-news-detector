A WikiLeaks email that was part of the most recent batch from Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta includes information that indicates that while Clinton and her aide Cheryl Mills claim to be too lame-brained to understand the significance of a “C” designation on classified emails, they’re not too dense to realize that documenting the fact that Hussein Obama knew all about her illegal email account and gave at a minimum tacit approval is not such a great idea. Not for those residing on the criminal side of the equation, anyway.
In an email chain that surfaced, much of the entire Clinton leadership team is seen scrambling to hide the documentation that would prove what we all already know, that Obama is a pathological liar. In this case it is proven by virtue of the his correspondence with Hillary Clinton on her illegal server.

The conflict arises from a statement by Obama that, as was so often the story the “out of the loop” Obama used, he just learned of Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email server and account to conduct State Department business on the television news.
The message was an alert from the same Clinton insider who was videotaped feeding propagandist Andrea Mitchell a question on the Clinton plane following the third debate, Nick Merrill. He’s informing Jen Palmieri, the Clinton communications director, that Obama is busted if any of those emails surface.
Campaign boss, Podesta gave orders, “We need to clean this up.” That’s Democrat or Clinton speak meaning it’s time to engage in their standard operating procedure of obstruction, obfuscation and cover up. Clearly the entire group is composed of liars covering for other liars, committing various acts of treason and exploitation against the American people and the United States along the way. That’s what the establishment politicians do, they’re treasonous rapists.  The Podesta email read:

Jen you probably have more on this but it looks like POTUS just said he
found out HRC was using her personal email when he saw it in the news.
