Wikileaks, how did we ever have presidential campaigns without you?  On Monday, October 31, after one too many emails from Democratic National Committee’s acting chairwoman, Donna Brazile, sharing debate questions and information came to light via the John Podesta gmail cache, CNN took a machete to her suspended contract. Politico broke the story:CNN says it is “completely uncomfortable” with hacked emails showing former contributor and interim DNC chair Donna Brazile sharing questions with the Clinton campaign before a debate and a town hall during the Democratic primary, and has accepted her resignation.Hacked emails posted by WikiLeaks show Brazile, whose CNN contract was suspended when she became interim DNC chair over the summer, sharing with the Clinton campaign a question that would be posed to Hillary Clinton before the March CNN Democratic debate in Flint, and sharing with the campaign a possible question prior to a CNN town hall also in March.In a statement, CNN spokeswoman Lauren Pratapas said that on Oct. 14, the network accepted Brazile’s resignation.“On October 14th, CNN accepted Donna Brazile’s resignation as a CNN contributor. (Her deal had previously been suspended in July when she became the interim head of the DNC.) CNN never gave Brazile access to any questions, prep material, attendee list, background information or meetings in advance of a town hall or debate. We are completely uncomfortable with what we have learned about her interactions with the Clinton campaign while she was a CNN contributor,” Pratapas said.The dates do invite confusion as this formal separation was announced seventeen days AFTER the resignation was accepted, and the email leaks are listed as the reason for the final cords being cut.  Any number of scenarios could have been discussed, but it looks like the impropriety – and getting caught – was just too much for CNN.Donna Brazile, for her part, thanked the people of CNN for their collegiality during her tenure there.Can’t you, the reader, just hear what this woman has to say?
