Immediately after India launched its PSLV C35 which placed multiple satellites in two different orbits, terrorist state Pakistan has announced that it too would launch satellites in a similar fashion.Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Commission (SUPARCO) chief Kaiser Anees has announced a three-fold increase of the budget for developing a launch vehicle that can equal India in its PSLV launching capabilities. Of course, given that no such budget has existed in the past, we are not sure how this will affect the program in any way.When our correspondent contacted SUPARCO, we were told that they were working on a new Launch Rocket which would achieve the same as India’s PSLV with a single burn. Revealing exclusive details, Dr. Anees said that SUPARCO will launch their BT-PSLV, short for Better Than Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle to launch satellites for the Pakistani government.To prove that Pakistan could do what India could, a competing satellite called SCATTERSAT-1 would be launched to take on India’s SCATSAT-1. According to Dr. Anees, it would provide better data on the oceans than any other satellite. “Indians think they can study the oceans from outer space? Well, when we launch BT-PSLV, the launch vehicle will get burnt completely and dump the satellite in the ocean. The satellite would then study the oceans from deep inside the waters!” scoffed Dr. Anees.According to Dr. Anees, this is only the beginning. “Next, we’ll send a rocket to Mars, and once that is successful, we’ll send another rocket to Mars with a terrorist, who, inshallah, would take out the Mangalyaan in line with the aspirations of the Martian people,” he said.As per reports received at the time of publishing this article, the Pakistan Air Force is giving the space program all the support it needs by closing the M-2 motorway for vehicles and enabling rockets to take off instead.
