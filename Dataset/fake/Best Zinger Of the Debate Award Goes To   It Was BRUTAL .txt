Hillary Clinton flubbed her line about fact checking trump, maybe the medication is set just a little off, telling the debate audience first they need to fat check him. That won’t be necessary and neither will fact checking on his statements.She makes a sales pitch for her website, encouraging those who need to be told what to think to go to her propaganda dissemination site and see what kind of spin they are putting on everything. She says they had millions fact-checking at the last debate and expects a repeat of the same this time around.She goes on to say that “It’s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.” Trump responded immediately, as if he’d been handed the line,  “Because you’d be in jail.”The audience went into an uproarious laughter at the comeback that she walked into. Clinton sat down like a fighter saved by the bell.Anderson Cooper went further to try to diminish the impact of the punch, saying, “We want to remind the audience to please not uh… talk out loud please do not applaud. You’re just wasting time.”It was a desperate to protect his candidate both by reducing the magnitude of that response but also of any future zingers that Mr. Trump might deliver through the course of the evening. The words for “Please, you’re making Hillary look like the criminal she is” seem to have escaped him.It was definitely one of the best lines of the night, maybe of the entire campaign.Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.
