Jaipur: Ever since Sanjay Leela Bhansali announced his ambitious period drama ‘Padmavati’, it has been facing one protest after another from various groups. Though the production team has repeatedly clarified that they are not going to hurt anyone’s sentiments with the film, protesters haven’t budged and continued the protests against the film. One such protester, Sandeep Singh, has now said that he will lead a protest against the film after its release if the film fails to sufficiently offends me.“I have spent last year of my life protesting against the offensive content in the film. Now if I find there was nothing offensive at all in the film then I will look like a complete idiot, won’t I?” Sandeep said ,”I can’t let the producers make a fool out of me like that. I will launch an even bigger agitation and will not stop till they add an offensive scene or two. Of course then I will protest against those offensive scenes.”When asked why is he planning to watch the movie at all if he suspects some scenes may offend me, Sandeep said ,”Are you kidding me? Did you see the trailer, film mast banayi hai Sanjay ne, Dekhni to padegi. I have to check whether the film is offensive or not to our sentiments as well, don’t I?”Meanwhile, several groups from various parts of the country have now asked Sanjay Leela Bhansali to show them the film before release so that they can check whether the film has any offensive content or not before the film hits the cinemas. “Great chance to watch the film for free and even before first day, first show viewers so why not, we also applied”, said the member of once such group.
