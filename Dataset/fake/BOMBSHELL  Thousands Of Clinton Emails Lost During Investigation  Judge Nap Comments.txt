No this is not a joke, and it is not satire.  As part of its investigation into Hillary Clinton and her illegal email practices, between subpoenas from the FBI via the State Department and Freedom of Information Act requests, the FBI did a number of interviews with former and current State Department people, and within those interviews comes the stunning information that in 2014, somehow, two boxes of Hillary Clinton’s emails disappeared.  From Fox News:Buried in the 189 pages of heavily redacted FBI witness interviews from the Hillary Clinton email investigation are details of yet another mystery — about two missing “bankers boxes” filled with the former secretary of state’s emails.The interviews released earlier this month, known as 302s, also reveal the serious allegation that senior State Department official Patrick Kennedy applied pressure to subordinates to change the classified email codes so they would be shielded from Congress and the public.The details about the boxes are contained in five pages of the FBI file – with a staggering 111 redactions – that summarize the statements of a State Department witness who worked in the “Office of Information Programs and Services (IPS).” The employee told the FBI that, “Initially, IPS officials were told there were 14 bankers boxes of former Secretary of State Hillary CLINTON’s emails at CLINTON’s Friendship Heights office.” Friendship Heights is a neighborhood that straddles the Northwest neighborhood of the District of Columbia and Maryland.The State Department witness further explained to the FBI that “on or about December 5, 2014, IPS personnel picked up only 12 bankers boxes of CLINTON’s emails from Williams & Connolly.Yes, this is a little confusing, but our good friend at Fox, Judge Andrew Napolitano was kind enough to unravel the mystery of where the two boxes in question originated, and why there is a real problem with them going missing.So, not only was all the information on where the emails traveled missing because Hillary & Company thought they would pull a fast one and PRINT them rather than provide the electronic files to the FBI, but somewhere between her office, her lawyer’s office and the FBI picking up the evidence during discovery, two boxes turn up missing.And the Clinton Campaign and mainstream media want us to concentrate on an eleven year old men’s locker room conversation where her presidential race opponent was talking like an alpha male about women.  Uh-huh.Yes, there’s a constant drip, drip, drip of damning information, and the presidential election is running interference with help from the mainstream media.  The whole thing stinks just the same.  The interviews with staffers tell of a mystery within a mystery of names redacted and one high-level staffer trying to get Hillary Clinton’s email address removed from the source files.
