And even Katrina realized it and conveyed the reason for the same.According to Katrina, she has worked extra hard for her role in Tiger Zinda Hai, in fact she has spoken total of 2 dialogues in the movie which is way higher than her previous films. She even tried to act in this movie which is a big challenge in itself. Known for here pretty face, Katrina’s expression are the last thing people watch on screen, but after so many failed attempts at acting, no one is willing to spare her incapabilities. But Katrina has taken the criticism in her strides and come out with a logical reason for the flaw. According to her, most of the viewership for the trailer was generated from North India which is facing severe smog due to which her expressions were not clearly visible to the audience on their phones, laptops and other gadgets.Katrina has assured the fans that once they watch it again after the winter months, they will realize that she has actually improved as an actor and will give her due credit for her hard work. Yashraj has even promised to come up with a new trailer which will only highlight Katrina’s expressions because any ways Bhai doesn’t give many expressions himself. So lets wait for the new trailer before judging a hard working actress.
