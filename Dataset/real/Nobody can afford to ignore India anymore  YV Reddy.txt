YV Reddy, former governor of the Reserve Bank of India and chairman of the Fourteenth Finance Commission, who was one of the panelist at an event here discussing the state of Indian economy said that while India “may not be the most attractive destination for investors, nobody can afford to ignore her anymore”.Reddy however, cautioned that the booming bond market in the country may not be a good sign and that policy makers should watch out for the risks it poses. “If the economy is growing at six or seven percent and if banks are not lending not because they don’t have money but they are not sure how the business is running. So my problem is whether the risk of the borrowers balance sheet has shifted from the banks now incrementally to the bond market,” said Reddy.Reddy also said, demonetisation of high value currency notes “can’t be justified” on economic grounds. Reddy, who headed the RBI from 2003 to 2008, said, “it is inconceivable that the Prime Minister did not know the impact… now the interesting part of it is a high risk was taken how much… it’s going to inconvenience people. So obviously it was a decision taken to demonstrate to the people that ‘I’m determined’ to fight corruption.”
