NEW DELHI: Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan pips Prime Minister Narendra Modi in popularity among children in the age group of nine and 18 years, according to a survey conducted by the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) released on Monday. The online survey as a part of World Children's Day study mentions that 15% of respondents in India said they would like to invite Bachchan to their birthday parties while 14% would rather have PM Modi attend. Sachin Tendulkar and late President APJ Abdul Kalam come third at 4% each. The survey was conducted between October 9 and 20 and covered 1,000 children mainly from urban areas. Unicef carried out a similar survey in 13 other countries. "Barack Obama, Cristiano Ronaldo, Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift are the most popular names for children to invite to their birthday party, with the former President of the United States featuring in the top five in nine of the 14 countries," the UN agency said in a statement. The survey showed that violence against children, access to healthcare, and poor education are among the biggest concerns for children in India. Poverty, bullying or mistreatment and natural disasters emerged as the other main worries. About 51% children aged between nine to 12 admitted worrying a lot about violence affecting children across the world, and 43% of 13-18 respondents felt concerned a lot over being personally affected by violence. "It is clear that children are acutely aware of the challenges their peers across the world face, and it is also apparent that they are afraid of being affected by these issues themselves," said Dr Yasmin Ali Haque, Unicef representative to India. According to the survey findings, 96% of children believed that their opinion is appreciated by their families while 87% believed that their opinion is appreciated by their teachers.
