Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal Friday said government schools in the city were “deliberately” being deteriorated before the AAP government came to power, and that his government had checked privatisation of education. Kejriwal was speaking at the launch of a web portal for the ‘Loan Guarantee Scheme and Scholarship’ at Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University , Friday. Education Minister Manish Sisodia was also present.Arguing that the AAP government had brought in “revolutionary” changes in education, Kejriwal said, “Earlier, government schools were deliberately being deteriorated in a systematic manner. The entire education sector — be it primary, secondary, colleges and technical — was moving towards privatisation. Fees were so high that the common man could not afford it. Since we came to power, we have changed the wave of privatisation of education.”He added, “When honest politics and people came to Delhi (government), principals and teachers did a wonderful job in the last two-and-a-half years, due to which Class XII results of government schools were better than that of private schools this year.”
