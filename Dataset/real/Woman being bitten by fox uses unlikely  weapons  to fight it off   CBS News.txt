Thankfully I have some waffles and coffee!"Doig's father scared the fox away."I heard Kayla starting to say, 'No, no, no. Get away,"' Bruce Doig said. "When you see somebody, especially your child, being attacked like that, it's painful."Police in Beverly, a city some 24 miles northeast of Boston, said she was the second person in town to be bitten by a fox.Doig says she was attacked about five hours after the first incident, which happened just a block away."It's really crazy. I was not expecting something like that to happen, especially outside my own house."Doig added that a fox was hit and killed by a truck on Tuesday.Hoping it's the same fox that bit Doig, officials are having it tested for rabies.
