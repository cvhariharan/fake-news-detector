GANDHINAGAR: BJP is witnessing dissidence and protests after it announced candidates' list for the Gujarat assembly polls. Several party workers reached Kamalam, the swanky headquarters of the ruling party in the outskirts of Gandhinagar, on Sunday and "warned BJP of consequences if their demands aren't met". Also, many workers took to the streets to protest either the dropping of the sitting MLAs or repeating the unpopular ones. BJP workers admit that while post-ticket allocation resentment is not new to the party, the scale of protest unleashed this time around is unprecedented. "Absence of Modiji has emboldened the ambitious candidates," said a mid-level Ahmedabad-based worker. The supporters of heavyweight Rajput leader IK Jadeja flocked Kamalam on Sunday after he was denied a ticket from Wadhwan. BJP has fielded Dhanji Patel, a first-timer. While Dhanji belongs to the same Leuva sub-caste as Hardik, Jadeja maintains the people of Dhrangadhra and workers of Wadhwan wanted him as BJP candidate, but lost patience when an outsider was fielded by the party. Jadeja, however, reiterated that he was very much in BJP. 61722794 But Liladhar Vaghela — BJP MP from Patan — has threatened to resign if his son Dilip is not fielded from Deesa in North Gujarat. Another BJP MP from Panchmahal, Prabhatsinh Chauhan, has decided to file his nomination papers as an independent from Kalol after his request for a ticket for his wife was turned down. Workers from Nikol in Ahmedabad too thronged Kamalam on Sunday protesting the repeat of Ahmedabad BJP city chief Jagdish Panchal from the constituency. Alleging arrogance and high handedness on the part of Panchal, the workers demanded that he be dropped. Resentment was also felt in Naroda in Ahmedabad, where the supporters of sitting MLA Nirmala Wadhwani protested her dropping.
