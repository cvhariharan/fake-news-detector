Even as protests by farmers ebbed in most parts of the state, the confrontation between sugar millers and cane growers in Solapur showed no sign of abating, with the growers taking to the streets again to voice their demand. Solapur, the home district of state Minister for Cooperatives Subhash Deshmukh, has been witnessing violence with cane growers disrupting the movement of cane demanding Rs 2,700 as first installment payment.At the start of the crushing season 2017-18, there were reports of violence from several districts of the state, as cane growers locked horns with millers over the first installment payment. In the cane belt of Sangli and Kolhapur, the confrontation was resolved after millers agreed to pay Rs 200 over the fair and remunerative price (FRP) as the first installment. During the agitation over FRP earlier this week, two farmers were injured in Ahmednagar, when police fired on the agitators. While the protests have died out in most parts of the state, it continues in Solapur.Ravikant Tupkar, leader of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, said farmers are asking for Rs 2,700 as the first installment payment. Millers in the region have expressed their inability to pay the amount. Senior millers pointed to the low sugar recovery in the region, which made the payment non-feasible. A meeting between millers and protesting farmers called by the sugar commissioner on Friday failed to resolve the deadlock.
