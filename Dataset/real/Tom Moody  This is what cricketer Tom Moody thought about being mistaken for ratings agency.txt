NEW DELHI. Former Australian cricketer Tom Moody had a humorous reaction to being mistaken for ratings agency Moody's Investors Service. Quoting a tweet from timesofindia, Moody - the man , not the agency- thanked those who were aware that he doesn't work in the "finance ratings industry". Thanks to all of you who have realise I don't work in the finance ratings industry! #Moodys ? https://t.co/A44FX8VAAP — Tom Moody (@TomMoodyCricket) 1511067361000 Two days before that, Moody was trolled online by the CPM after Moody's Investors Service, a US based agency, upgraded India's sovereign credit rating to 'Baa2' from 'Baa3'. The comedy of errors had begun after several CPM leaders including Sitaram Yechury criticized India's sovereign rating upgrade. While Yechury didn't mistake the cricketer for the ratings agency, other CPM supporters did. Comrades, mostly from Kerala, India's most literate state said that Moody should be ashamed of himself for raising India's credit rating. Some even dared him to visit Kerala. However, CPM supporters soon realized their blunder and started blaming the RSS-BJP for this "conspiracy to defame communists". They alleged that trolling happened from fake accounts that were pretending to be communists.
