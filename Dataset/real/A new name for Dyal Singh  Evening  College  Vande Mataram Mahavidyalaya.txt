The Governing Body (GB) of Dyal Singh College (DSC), in a meeting held Friday, decided that Dyal Singh (Evening) College would be called ‘Vande Mataram Mahavidyalaya’ once it is converted to a morning college. Since Dyal Singh (Morning) College already exists, Dyal Singh (Evening) College — set up in 1958 and the first evening college in Delhi University — will have to be renamed. Chairman of the Governing Body, Amitabh Sinha, a BJP leader and a lawyer, said the name was picked “to pay obeisance to the mother”. Sinha said the GB’s resolution, finalising the college name, has been sent to the DU Vice-Chancellor, who will take “necessary action” and give formal approval.On September 21, Dyal Singh (Evening) principal Pawan K Sharma had received a notification that the Executive Council has given approval to the evening college becoming a full-fledged day college. While the college has shifted to morning timings — both for official work and classes — a DU-appointed committee is in the process of demarcating and sharing physical assets of the two colleges. Even on Friday, some teachers and students protested against the bifurcation process, outside the GB meeting venue.The college was earlier considering the name, ‘Madan Mohan Malviya College’. It is currently named after Dyal Singh Majithia, who founded the The Tribune newspaper in 1881 and the Punjab National Bank in 1894. The college website says Majithia also set up an education trust in 1895 for a “truly secular college”, and DSC was born out of that trust.Explaining why ‘Vande Mataram Mahavidyalaya’ was chosen over ‘Madan Mohan Malviya College’, Sinha told The Indian Express, “Woh (Malviya) kiske bachche the? Hum unhi ko pranaam kar rahe hain. Maa ka darza sabse upar hota hai aur unhe pranaam karna hai. (Whose child was Malviya? We are paying respect to her. The stature of the mother is above all else). Vande mataram means to pay obeisance to the mother. There is no politics in the name.”
