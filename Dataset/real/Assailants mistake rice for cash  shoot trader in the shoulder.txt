A trader from Punjab was shot at by three unidentified gunmen in northwest Delhi’s Shakurpur on Saturday evening. Police said the trader, identified as Rajesh, was carrying a packet of rice. The assailants mistook it for valuables and tried to wrest the packet from him. “Rajesh was walking past Britannia Chowk, when the men spotted him and decided to follow him. They intercepted him and tried to snatch the packet. In the tussle, one of the men shot Rajesh in the shoulder,” a police officer said.
