NEW DELHI: BSF has stepped up vigil along the Pakistan border after foiling a bid by drug smugglers to push in a consignment of heroin. In an operation which is being talked about in the security circles for successful collaboration among security forces, BSF worked with the Counter Intelligence wing of Punjab Police to thwart the armed narco smugglers who were bringing in the contraband in the Ferozpur sector. The seizure included 22kg of heroine, one 9 mm pistol of Turkish-make and several rounds of ammunition from a spot which was found marked with blood stains, an indication that the Pakistan-based smugglers suffered injuries after the alert posse of BSF troopers fired upon them. BSF views the incident as serious as the smugglers, undeterred by the approaching BSF personnel, had persisted with their aggressive postures, a pointer that the smuggler network across the border may try to take advantage of smog and fog to send drugs across. The BSF chief reviewed the situation with additional director general (western command) Kamal Nayan Chaubey and other senior officers. But there is also satisfaction over the successful conduct of the operation. It was a specific intelligence tip-off which led BSF to close in on the infiltration point. Smuggling of drugs has over the years emerged as a security challenge: a threat which, while responsible for rampant addiction, has spawned a network of criminals working in tandem with smugglers across the border. In 2017, BSF intercepted nearly 200kg of heroin and two thousand kg of opium.
