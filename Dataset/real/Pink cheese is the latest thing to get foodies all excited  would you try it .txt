Looks like millennial pink has reached an all-time high. The dusty salmon hue already had a strong influence in the world of  fashion, beauty, interiors, vodka, gin and most recently, the pink chocolate, but looks like there’s no end to this. A British company called Great British Cheese Company has come out with a cheese wheel that tastes like prosecco (white wine) and looks a pretty shade of pink. It gets its salmon pink colour from the lovely flavour of raspberry added to it.If you love cheese and prosecco (white wine), and the colour pink then this is definitely the thing for you.While there are sceptics who are revolted at the idea, according to the comments on the company’s Facebook page, others seem to be overjoyed at the prospect of this culinary delight.“No. Just no. Cheese should be cheese flavoured! Prosecco tastes just fine from a glass,” wrote one vexed Tweeter.“Two things I absolutely adore,” said another.Though the reactions are mixed, we can’t help but be excited about the trend.The cheese company has come up with interesting cheese variations like the peri-peri cheese, which is a unique blend of cheddar and South American chillies and cheese caramelised with red wine among others.
