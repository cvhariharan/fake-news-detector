"I feel like people get more into it with their dogs than they do in their own Halloween costumes."Some certainly do get into it. A woman named Diane dressed as double-decker bus employees with her family while their pack of French bulldogs dressed as tourists on a miniature "pawline" bus. They built the dog bus with PVC pipes, foam board and lots of red duct tape."Instead of hop on hop off, it's bark on bark off," Diane explained. "She even has her own little selfie-stick just like a tourist."Thousands of dogs paraded before the judges. The top prize, however, was not for them but tickets to "Hamilton" for their owners.The parade benefits the park's dog run, which organizers say was the first of its kind in any city park.
