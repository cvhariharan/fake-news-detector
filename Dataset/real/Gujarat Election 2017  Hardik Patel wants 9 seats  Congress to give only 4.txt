AHMEDABAD: The deadlock between the Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) and Congress over ticket distribution continued on Saturday with Hardik Patel's outfit demanding nine tickets for its key players and the Congress ready to part with only four. PAAS representatives had gone to meet Congress leaders on Friday to discuss ticket sharing and the quota issue. However, by late Friday evening, PAAS leaders gave a 24-hour ultimatum to Congress for a final decision on the quota formula or face statewide protests. "We have put forward our demand for nine tickets from Congress, especially in Patidar-dominated areas in Ahmedabad, north Gujarat and Saurashtra. But Congress is not ready to commit more than four tickets," a top source in PAAS told TOI.

However, after the alleged sex tape controversy, Congress leaders are adamant on giving us only four tickets," said a PAAS leader "This will create friction within PAAS as members who supported the outfit even when Hardik was in jail and had constantly opposed BJP, will be dejected," a member said. State Congress chief Bharatsinh Solanki said due to a series of meetings, they could not meet PAAS leaders in Delhi. "There were no discussions on Congress tickets to PAAS members," he said.
