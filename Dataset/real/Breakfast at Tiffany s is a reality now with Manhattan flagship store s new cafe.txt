Who can forget the iconic scene from the 1961 blockbuster ‘Breakfast at Tiffany’s’ when Audrey Hepburn snacks on a pastry while gazing into a Tiffany & Co. shop window on Fifth Avenue? With the luxury jewellery brand launching an eatery at the same Manhattan flagship store, this scene from the film has suddenly taken a brand new meaning.Named the Blue Box Café, it’s inspired by the much-loved Robin egg blue packaging that Holly Golightly talked about in the movie. The blue and silver space has been used to showcase the brand’s new home and accessories collection with the cafe serving American classics and elevated traditional New York meals.The morning breakfast at the cafe will set you back by $29. There’s coffee, croissant, truffle eggs, seasonal fruit with avocado toast, smoked-salmon-and-bagel stack or buttermilk waffles to choose from. If you’re feeling flush, you can also go for a two-course $39 lunch or the $49 tea service, which comes with a selection of finger sandwiches. Of course it’s a little expensive for the commoners, but for the fans it’s all about living the experience.
