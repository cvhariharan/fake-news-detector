NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday conditionally allowed Karti Chidambara, son of Congress leader P Chidambaram, to visit UK from December 1 to December 10 for his daughter's admission at a university there. A bench comprising Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud asked Karti Chidambaram to file an undertaking before it within three days, giving assurance that he will abide by the timeline and return to India on the expiry of the period. Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the CBI, submitted a note to the court in response to its query on the probe agency's stand on Karti Chidambaram's plea seeking to go abroad. The bench, however, made it clear that its order, permitting Karti Chidambaram to go abroad, will not be cited before any court of law as precedent. A lookout notice issued by the CBI on July 18 prevents Karti from travelling abroad without the investigating agency's permission. The CBI had on September 1 told the top court that there were "good, cogent" reasons for issuing the lookout notice. Earlier, the apex court had said that Karti Chidambaram would not be allowed to leave India without subjecting himself to investigation in the case. The court had then stayed the high court order putting on hold the lookout notice against Karti Chidambaram. On November 9, the Supreme Court had asked the CBI to apprise it of its stand on allowing the request of Karti Chidambaram to go abroad for a few days. The CBI FIR, lodged on May 15, had alleged irregularities in Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) clearance to INX Media for receiving overseas funds to the tune of Rs 305 crore in 2007 when Karti's father P. Chidambaram was the Union finance minister in Congress-led UPA government.
