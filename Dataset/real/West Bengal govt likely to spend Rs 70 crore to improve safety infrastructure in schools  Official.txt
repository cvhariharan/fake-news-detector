THE STATE government will spend Rs 70 crore to improve safety infrastructure in schools, Principal Secretary (School Education) Dushyant Nariala said on Saturday. The conclave was attended by over 100 school teachers, including 45 principals.Speaking at the CII School Excellence Conclave in Kolkata, Nariala said: “Developing sound infrastructure in schools with good hygiene and clean environment, and making them free from the scourge of tobacco, drugs and cyber threats dominates the state’s agenda. The government has recently set up safety committees in schools to look into safety issues.”“In all, there are 25 safety issues, ranging from healthy food, nutrition, protection from outsiders to stopping the use of tobacco and drugs in the campus and safeguarding cyber threats,” he added. Later, speaking to mediapersons, he said: “A sum of Rs 70 crore has been sanctioned to improve the safety infrastructure in government and government-aided schools all over the state.”Nariala said the state government is also seriously looking at curbing bullying in schools.“In these changing times, which are largely dominated by technology, it is imperative to focus on building schools in a holistic manner. The development of a good human being is the main goal of education. A greater emphasis should be laid on multi-disciplinary learning and have individual plans for students. The system should involve studies in sports, art and extra-curricular activities. Technology will have a greater presence in future schools,”
he added.On the digital initiative of the state, Nariala said: “The West Bengal government has developed 4,000 e-classrooms in 2,000 secondary schools. Under the government’s ICT (Information and Communication Technology) programme, 3,915 secondary schools have been provided 39,300 computers in the last five years.”
