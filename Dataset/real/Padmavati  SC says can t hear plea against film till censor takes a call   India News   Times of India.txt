NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday dismissed a plea to ban public screening of Sanjay Leela Bhansali's 'Padmavati', saying it is premature as the censor board is yet to take a call on the issue and the court could not usurp the functions of the statutory body. A bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud, which had earlier dismissed a similar petition, said it was premature to file petition against release of the film as Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) is yet to clear the movie. "CBFC has a definite role and it will decide the issue as per the guidelines. It is their duty. How can the court intervene and stay screening of the film. The board has a statutory duty. Can the court injunct the statutory body from exercising its duty? You are crossing the statutory steps and coming directly to court. It is pre-mature," the bench said. The court passed the order on a PIL filed by advocate Manohar Lal Sharma alleging that the film hurt sentiments of people by distorting and twisting historical facts and portraying queen Padmavati in a bad light. He also told the bench that producers and director of the film should be prosecuted for defaming a historical personality. Senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for the producers, refuted the allegation and said there was no merit in the petition as the film was yet to cleared by the censor board.
