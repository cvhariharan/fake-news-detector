 DU’s Dyal Singh (Morning) College wants to know from their students whether teachers are regular to class, have an interest in the subject, and are “open-minded”. These questions are part of a feedback form the college will provide to students — a move that has irked some teachers who call it “action against the academic community”. Only those students who have more than 70 per cent attendance will be asked to fill the feedback form. The first part of the form asks for details from students on the subjects they are studying, the marks they scored in the previous semester, and whether they intend to pursue a career in the same subject.The second part of the form asks students a series of questions, to be answered with a ‘yes’ or a ‘no’. The form is set to be passed in the governing body meeting soon.The questions are: Students have also been asked to write a line on what they “like best” about their teacher. Some teachers, however, criticised the system. Naveen Gaur, a teacher at the college, said, “It is obvious that teachers who are liberal and not very strict will get better feedback. This is going to affect the teaching-learning process. Other colleges might also be taking such feedback, but this is one of the worst kind of documents we have seen.” College principal I S Bakshi did not respond to queries on the issue.
