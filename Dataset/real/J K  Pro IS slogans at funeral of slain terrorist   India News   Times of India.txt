SRINAGAR: Thousands of people gathered in Parampora area on Srinagar-Gulmarg road to join the funeral of a terrorist killed by security forces, and raised anti-Hurriyat, and pro-Islamic State and pro-Zakir Musa slogans. Cries of "Na Hurriyat wali Shariat, na Hurriyat wali azadi, Kashmir banega Darul Islam (neither Hurriyat-type Shariat, nor Hurriyat-type freedom, Kashmir will become an Islamist nation)," rent the air at the funeral of a Tehreek-ul Mujahideen militant, Mugees Ahmad Mir. The body of Mugees, who was killed in a shoot-out at Zukura in the outskirts of Srinagar on Friday, was shrouded in Islamic State terror group's flag, as thousands walked with his coffin on Saturday. While Jammu & Kashmir Police on Sunday refuted suggestions of IS influence on Kashmir militancy, there's no gainsaying the impact of Zakir Musa, appointed commander of the terrorist group Hizbul Mujahideen following the killing of Burhan Wani at the hands of security forces in 2016. IG Kashmir, Munir Khan, said, "We are in the process of investigations as to what is the quantum of influence of ISIS on Kashmir militancy."
