Former President Pranab Mukherjee said in her death, Indira left a message that "a commitment to the people can never be killed by any power, however strong it may be". Sonia said she came to know the late leader, her mother-in-law, intimately as the head of the family and "came to understand how passionately she felt for her country, cared for the poor and the oppressed". A photo exhibition titled 'A Life of Courage' was inaugurated at her memorial where former PM Manmohan Singh was present besides other party leaders. Singh has been named the recipient of 'Indira Gandhi prize for peace, disarmament and development' for 2017.
