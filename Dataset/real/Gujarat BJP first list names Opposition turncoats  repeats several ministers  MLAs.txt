THE BJP’s first list of 70 candidates, including 42 constituencies that to go to the polls in the first phase on December 9, has Congress turncoats, rebels, and repeats most ministers, MLAs and candidates of 2012. Among others, the list includes 2007-batch IPS officer P C Baranda, who quit as Superintendent of Police of Chhota Udepur, contesting from Bhiloda, in Aravalli district, and founder-owner of Makson Group, a confectionery giant, Dhanji Patel, who will contest from Wadhwan in Surendranagar district.Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, deputy CM Nitin Patel and BJP Gujarat unit chief Jitu Vaghani, who recently made peace with Karadia Rajputs, who were protesting against him in his constituency, will contest from the same seats: Rajkot West, Mehsana and Bhavnagar West, respectively.The BJP has delayed announcement of candidates on major seats in Surat, Saurashtra and Kutch, where the party is facing protests from Patidars, or areas Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi toured during his recent Gujarat yatra.From the six seats of Kutch, of which BJP holds five, the party is said to be facing internal rebellion. It has declared the candidate for only one seat — Anjar, (Vasan Ahir is contesting). From the eight seats of Surendranagar and Morbi districts, only two — Limbdi (Kirtisinh Rana) and Wadhwan (Dhanji Patel) — were announced.

The party also allotted ticket to former agriculture minister Dilip Sanghani but changed his seat. Sanghani was involved in alleged irregularities in awarding fishing contracts in the state and was defeated by Paresh Dhanani from Amreli. He will contest the December 9 polls from Dhari seat in Amreli district, overlooking sitting MLA Nalin Kotadiya.Kotadiya, who had won the 2012 polls from Dhari on a Gujarat Parivartan Party (GPP) ticket, had joined the BJP after GPP merged with the ruling party later. The MLA had openly supported the Patidar agitation and exhorted the community to defeat BJP in the 2015 local body elections. Later, he toed the BJP line. On Friday, Kotadiya released a video statement saying he had decided not to contest the Assembly election this year, and that he had not sought ticket for any seat.Twenty-eight candidates were announced for the second phase of polling on December 14, even as severe infighting surfaced as soon as the list was made public on Friday. The party gave tickets to all five opposition MLAs who joined the BJP in the run-up to the high-pitch Rajya Sabha elections in August — five of the Congress and one from JD(U). Senior leaders, the five hold influence in their respective constituencies.The BJP also announced candidates for the districts of Patan and Banaskantha, which were severely affected by floods in July. They go to the polls in the second phase.Of nine seats in Banaskantha, BJP had won three in 2012; the remaining six are with the Congress. The party won three of Patan’s four seats — the fourth MLA, Balwantsinh Rajput (Siddhpur seat), defected to the BJP in August to contest for Rajya Sabha.

Fifteen ministers in the Rupani Cabinet have been nominated on their respective seats: including Shankar Chaudhary (Vav), Keshaji Chauhan (Deodar), Dilip Thakor (Chanasma), Bhupendrasinh Chudasama (Dholka), Jayesh Radadiya (Jetpur), Chiman Shapariya (Jamjodhpur), Jashabhai Barad (Somnath).Sources said the first list of candidates indicates that the party is treading cautiously in the state it has governed for more than two decades. Although leaders express confidence, the decision to repeat almost all MLAs indicates the party does not want to “waste time” in placating those who would be disgruntled at being dropped. Both Narendra Modi, when he was the Gujarat chief minister, and party president Amit Shah have dropped dozens of sitting MLAs in order to counter the anti-incumbency factor.Shah, in fact, had faced criticism of aspirants and ire of their supporters, who demonstrated on the streets, in the run-up to the Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls. In 2007, Modi had denied tickets to 47 sitting MLAs in Gujarat, and 30 in 2012.

With the Congress making attempts to consolidate votes on caste lines, the BJP leadership tried to accommodate different communities in the first list. The list of 70 includes 15 Patels (Patidars have been the party’s major support base until last elections), 18 OBCs, eight Thakors, six Kolis, three Ahirs, two Chaudharis, six Rajputs, two Jains and three Brahmins, according to sources. The party is fielding a Patel (Dhanjibhai) and replacing sitting MLA Varshaben Doshi, a Brahmin, in Brahmin-dominated Wadhwan seat.
