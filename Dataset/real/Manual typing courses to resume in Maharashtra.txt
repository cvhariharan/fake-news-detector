Three months after deciding to axe the manual typewriting exam in the state, the Maharashtra government on Thursday decided to give the go-ahead for resuming manual typing courses.
“The government is giving approval for starting typing courses in all government-approved shorthand and typewriting institutes till November 30, 2019.All approved institutes should change their syllabus to include computer typing along with manual typewriting lessons. After November 30, 2019, the state will evaluate the computer typewriting courses started in these institutes and then decide on whether manual typewriting courses should continue,” the state government said in a circular.Maharashtra had over 3,500 typing and shorthand training institutes in which over 7 lakh students took the Government Certificate in Computer Typing Basic Course (GCC-TBC) every year. The test helped evaluate the students’ typing skills and the certification came in handy when people applied for government jobs.However, with typewriters becoming outmoded and almost redundant, the government was keen to shut down the course. “Typewriting machines are outdated, manufacturers have shut shop and there are no spare parts available in market. We need computer-trained individuals for government offices as wes adapt to e-governance,” said a GR released in October, 2013 by the department of school education and sports, which laid the grounds for the shutting of such schools.
