NEW DELHI: Even as Indian agencies and J&K police verify the alleged Islamic State claim owning up the November 17 attack in Srinagar that killed a J&K policeman, officials doubt any direct involvement though they are concerned over the outfit's capability to attract self-radicalised recruits. "IS does not have a presence or any resources in Kashmir to carry out an attack, even though its online propaganda may be followed by the Valley's youth. It is more likely that an IS franchise or Pakistan-based elements influenced or owing allegiance to IS could be involved. However, this too needs to be verified," a senior intelligence operative told TOI. The officer added that while the IS may not have planned, financed or deployed its men for such an attack, which it has claimed to be its first strike in J&K, the outfit may be seeing this as propaganda to rope in Kashmiri youth and promote their radicalisation. "As long as IS is making its presence felt in Pakistan, we are not bothered. But if these groups start getting to Kashmir, it is a cause for worry," the official said. According to sources, the IS claiming responsibility for the Zakura attack also seems to fit into the global pattern of the outfit owning up to any lone-wolf or jihadi attack in non-IS territory, whether or not there exist any linkages, just to make its presence felt globally. "For example, IS owned up to Las Vegas shooting though the US investigators are yet to find an IS link. It has similarly claimed responsibility for the July 1 attack last year at a Dhaka eatery, even as investigators in Bangladesh insisted that the attack was carried out by those linked to terrorists affiliated to the local outfit Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen.
