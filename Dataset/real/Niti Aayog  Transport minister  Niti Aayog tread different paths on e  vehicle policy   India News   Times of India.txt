NEW DELHI: The road transport ministry and Niti Aayog are not on the same page on the proposed electric mobility (e-vehicle) policy. The ministry has suggested to Niti Aayog to redraft the policy, saying the government's think tank should not get into the implementation of the mission as mentioned in the present draft. The ministry has also suggested that the policy should be framed after a meeting preferably chaired by the principal secretary to the Prime Minister. It has also objected to the proposal of keeping the ministry out in the apex panel proposed by the Niti Aayog to take decisions on the rollout of electric mobility mission. Interestingly, ministries of urban and rural development are part of the panel beside the Niti Aayog. Addressing a conference on smart mobility organised by industry body FICCI, Gadkari on Monday said battery swapping policy proposed for the successful rollout of electric vehicles is unviable. Battery swapping means generic batteries which can be used by any electric vehicle and are available at petrol pumps or other charging stations on rent. "The swapping (battery) policy, I feel is not appropriate for the country because it is a very difficult thing that is not going to be possible in the country," Gadkari said. He added Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant had discussions with him on the issue and he had suggested scrapping of the idea. Niti Aayog, in a suggestion paper, had said that accelerated adoption of electric and shared vehicles could save $60 billion in diesel and petrol cost and cut down as much as one gigatonne of carbon emissions for India by 2030 while advocating standardised, smart and swappable batteries with lease and/or pay-per-use business models.
