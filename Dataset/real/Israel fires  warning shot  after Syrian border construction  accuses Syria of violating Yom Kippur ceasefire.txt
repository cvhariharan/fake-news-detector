The Israeli military says it has fired a tank shell into Syria as a “warning shot” after the Syrian military conducted construction along their border. The military says Syria violated the 1974 cease-fire agreement on the Golan Heights today by using heavy tools to fortify a military post in the demilitarized zone between the countries.
