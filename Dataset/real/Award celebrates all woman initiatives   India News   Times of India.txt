BENGALURU: An act of courage irrespective of caste, creed, religion and race, deserves celebration. Working tirelessly towards creating change, striving for excellence through compassion and love defines human excellence. Celebrating this undying spirit to making a difference to society, the Sri Sathya Sai Baba Award for Human Excellence 2017 comes with inspiring stories of women battling selflessly for a better world. This year, for the first time, the award has brought to the forefront, an all-woman awardee list to highlight their struggles in eradicating prejudice and abuse in society. In its second year, the award highlights the efforts of outstanding people from across the world in seven categories — education, environment, health, music and fine arts, unity of religions, women and child welfare, and sports. The award ceremony will be on November 23 at the Sathya Sai ashram in Mudenahalli, near Bengaluru. Mallika Srinivasan, chairman, TAFE, who is also spearheading the initiative, told TOI that although there are seven categories, nine women will be receiving the awards. "It is so inspiring that women are courageously doing something, rising above the greatest of adversities in their own lives. The whole experience of choosing the winners has been a transformational experience. These women are examples of people who are creatively trying to make a difference to the world," she said.
