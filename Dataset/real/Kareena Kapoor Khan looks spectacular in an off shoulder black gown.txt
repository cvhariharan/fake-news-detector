If you love Sonam Kapoor’s sense of style then you should probably know by now that it’s her sister Rhea Kapoor who is the brain behind the actor’s sartorial choices and excellent styling. This time, it was not her younger sibling but actor Kareena Kapoor Khan that Rhea worked her magic for.At the promotional shoot of the Lux Golden Rose Awards 2017, the Ki and Ka actor set temperatures soaring in an off-shoulder black dress. In all honesty, we think she looked spectacular in an Ashi Studio RTW AW17 number with a chiffon train.With her hair neatly tied into a low bun, Kareena kept her make-up minimal with her signature style smokey eyes and nude lips.Perfectly complementing her attire were the statement rings from H Craft Fine Jewellery, Aurelle by Leshna Shah and diamond studs by Minawala Jewellers.Prior to this, she was seen is another off-shoulder ensemble, also styled by Rhea Kapoor. Wearing a shimmery golden gown from Abu Jani-Sandeep Khosla, the actor flaunted her toned legs in the thigh-high slit dress with feather sequins drapes.Make-up artist Mickey Contractor mastered yet another nude look for the diva.
