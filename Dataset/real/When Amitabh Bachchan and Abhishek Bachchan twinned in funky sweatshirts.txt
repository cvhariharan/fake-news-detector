Time and again Amitabh Bachchan has proved that age has nothing to do with style. His fashionable blazers have always been the talk of the town and while his approach to fashion is definitely different, we can’t say that he has always managed to deliver.Recently, senior Bachchan was spotted with his son in a colourful sweatshirt at his granddaughter Aaradhya’s birthday celebration at JW Marriott, Mumbai. To give it a funky twist Amitabh Bachchan wore a scarf tucked inside his Marcelo Burlon sweatshirt along with his usual luxe loafers.Even son Abhishek Bachchan decided to follow his father’s footsteps but looks like he was not keen to experiment. Junior Bachchan paired it with his casuals from Dolce & Gabbana and styled it with white shoes.This is not the first time when they wore something similar. At a recent family wedding, we saw both of them grace the function in ethnic wear and matching turbans.@SrBachchan Happy Childrens’ Day Amitji @SONIYALUVSU @girisum @juniorbachchan @earth2angel @sunny1media pic.twitter.com/CJ1syqECFf— sk (@Shravanhum) November 13, 2017
