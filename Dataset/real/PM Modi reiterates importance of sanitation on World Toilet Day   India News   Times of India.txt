Their invaluable contribution adds solid momentum to Swachh Bharat Mission," he tweeted. On a related note, the United Nations General Assembly officially in 2013 designated November 19 as World Toilet Day, and is coordinated by UN-Water in collaboration with governments and partners, to recognise the action to tackle the global sanitation crisis. Today, 4.5 billion people live without a household toilet that safely disposes of their waste. The Sustainable Development Goals, launched in 2015, include a target to ensure everyone has access to a safely-managed household toilet by 2030. This makes sanitation central to eradicating extreme poverty. Get latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.
