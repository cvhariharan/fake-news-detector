It’s an effort that attempts to bring closer to the residents of Chandigarh, the work, vision and genius of Swiss architect Pierre Jeanneret, who collaborated with his cousin, Le Corbusier, for about 20 years in realising the urban fabric of India’s first planned modern city. The first chief architect of the city, Jeanneret made Chandigarh his home and work place, carefully monitoring and supervising the city’s construction on a day-to-day basis.On Jeanneret’s 50th death anniversary (March 22, 1896 – December 4, 1967), the Chandigarh College of Architecture is organising a symposium ‘Pierre Jeanneret, The Foot Architect of Chandigarh’ (December 3 and 4) to commemorate his legacy, designing a series of events that will be open to the public.The philosophy of the symposium being to get the citizens of Chandigarh closer to the history of the city, the work of Jeanneret and also involve them in the preservation of the city and its unique architecture.“We want the people of Chandigarh to participate and be involved in the event, and that is why we have worked on ideas that will appeal to a larger audience, and at the same time, introduce them to the legacy and work of Jeanneret,” said Sangeeta Bagga Mehta, principal of the college.The symposium will begin with guided tours by students and faculty of CCA to the Capitol Complex, Pierre Jeanneret Museum; Old architect’s office (Le Corbusier Centre) and key buildings of the Panjab University. “As part of the tour, people can go up to the terraces of some of the buildings of PU and also the housing here, and photograph the spectacular views. The entire college, both students and faculty are involved in every aspect of the effort,” adds Mehta.Jeanneret was responsible for designing iconic buildings such as the Gandhi Bhawan and the University Library at Panjab University, MLA Hostels in Sector 3 and 4, Polytechnic for Men (now CCET) in Sector 26, the State Library, Town Hall and the General Post Office Building in Sector 17, the Architects’ Office (now Le Corbusier Centre) in Sector 19, the PGIMER in Sector 12.Jeanneret also designed furniture, both independently and with Charlotte Perriand, experimenting with minimalist design, green architecture and spaces that were energy efficient.The symposium will also include an exhibition of photographs of the buildings of PU designed by Jeanneret, as well as a showcase of drawings, maps, and archival material in collaboration with the Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal.The keynote lecture, ‘Remembering Pierre Jeanneret: Celebrating the Power of the Ordinary’ will be delivered by Professor Kiran Joshi, who has written a book on Jeanneret, with architects Jit Malhotra and SD Sharma, who worked with Jeanneret, being honoured on the occasion.The second day, December 4, will be dedicated to panel sessions by prominent academicians and practising architects .The detailed programme is attached. On December 4 will be a panel discussion on ‘Architectural Practices that carry forth the heritage of Pierre Jeanneret’, as academicians from across the country get together for a discourse on how to teach modern architecture and also conserve the heritage ensembles of Jeanneret.
