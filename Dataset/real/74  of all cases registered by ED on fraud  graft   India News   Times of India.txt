NEW DELHI: The real threat to the Indian economy is from frauds, cheating and corruption which accounted for 74% of all cases registered by the Enforcement Directorate in the last one year and not as much from drugs, narcotics or arms smuggling, according to a study conducted by the agency. About 83% of all money laundering cases registered by the ED in the last one year are those related to financial institutions and real estate, and not linked to gold, arms or explosives catch. Gold related cases accounted for a mere 7% while others were 10%, the ED study said. In an example cited for corruption involving a senior IAS officer, the agency said the accused was aided by his chartered accountant to operate 446 benami bank accounts for 13 shell companies. The IAS officer had deposited Rs 39 crore in these accounts between 2006-09. The ED conducted the sample study as a risk assessment exercise focusing on cases booked by the agency post demonetisation between November 2016 and September 2017. It found that frauds and cheating were the two major threats to the Indian economy while the proceeds of crime were laundered through financial institutions using shell companies and investments in real estate. "The vicious circle of illegal wealth is not only involved in domestic circular trading but has moved out of Indian borders. Banking channels are used and remittances are made using shell companies to avoid compliances. Such activities are known as trade based money laundering," the study said expressing concern on how regulatory mechanism has failed to curb generation of black money.
