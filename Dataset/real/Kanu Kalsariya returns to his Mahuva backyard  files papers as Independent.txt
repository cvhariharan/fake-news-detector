Activist and former BJP and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Kanu Kalsariya filed his nomination from Mahuva Assembly constituency in Bhavnagar district as an Independent even as the ruling BJP announced to field its sitting MLA Bhavna Makwana’s husband Raghavaji as its candidate from the seat on Friday. This marks return of Kalsariya to his old backyard of Mahuva after trying to seek support of voters in neighbouring Gariyadhar Assembly constituency in 2012.Accompanied by scores of his supporters, Kalsariya filed his nomination papers with the office of returning officer of Mahuva as an Independent candidate on Friday. This is for the fifth time that Kalsariya, who is a general surgeon, has jumped in the fray for an Assembly constituency. He had won from Mahuva seat as a BJP candidate in 1998, 2002 and 2007. He had contested the 2012 election from Gariyadhar as an Independent but had lost. He had also lost Lok Sabha election from Rajkot as candidate of Aam Aadmi Party in 2014.

Kalsariya had hit headlines in 2008-09 when he opposed a proposed cement plant of Nirma. He went against the line of the BJP government in the state and sided with farmers of his constituency who were opposing the plant on the grounds that it was proposed to be built on a water-body. The matter had reached the Gujarat High Court and eventually Nirma had shelved its plans.After falling foul with the BJP, Kalsariya had floated Sadbhavana Manch in the 2012 Assembly election and the group had fought from five seats spread in Bhavanagar and Amreli districts. However, the group had failed to open its account as Kalsariya himself lost from Gariyadhar seat. In fact, he had come third after Congress in the seat won by the BJP. In the process, the doctor, who is running two charitable hospitals in Mahuva also lost his backyard of Mahuva to Bharati Makwana of BJP.Later on he had joined AAP and was made its convenor for Gujarat. He contested the 2014 Lok Sabha poll as AAP candidate from Bhavnagar but lost out to Bharati Shiyal of BJP.But 62-year-old Kalsariya says he has learnt his lessons. “Leaving my area of Mahuva and instead contesting from Gariyadhar seat was a blunder. May be, I was overconfident. In the Lok Sabha election, those close to me asked me not to contest. But AAP leadership told me that if I would not contest, nobody else will contest in Gujarat. Therefore, I had to jump in the fray,” Kalsariya told The Indian Express.

When asked why he had decided to contest as an Independent and not as a candidate of AAP, Kalsariya said: “People of Mahuva feel that they will be better served if I contest as an Independent and not as candidate of any political party. Being Independent candidate, I will also have full liberty to serve people of my constituency. On top of this, AAP chief Aravind Kejriwal was of the view that the party should not field candidates from Mahuva. Therefore, I had told them in advance that I intend to contest the election anyway.”Kalsariya also said that he may extend support to Congress. “Congress is emerging as the only option which can defeat the BJP. So, I will extend support to Congress provided it doesn’t field its candidate in Mahuva seat,” he said.Meanwhile, the BJP announced Raghavji Makwana as its candidate for the the December 9 poll. Makwana is husband of sitting BJP MLA from Mahuva, Bhavna Makwana. He is also leader of opposition in Congress-ruled Bhavnagar districtd panchayat besides holding the post of vice-president of Bhavnagar district unit of the BJP.

However, soon after Raghavji was declared BJP candidate for Mahuva, former president of Mahuva municipality, Bipin Sanghavi resigned from the saffron party. He said that he had been associated the party since its inception but the party was neglecting him. Sanghavi is also a sitting BJP councillor in Mahuva municipality.
