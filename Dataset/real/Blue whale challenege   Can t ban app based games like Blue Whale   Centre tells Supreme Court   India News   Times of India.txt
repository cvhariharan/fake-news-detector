NEW DELHI: The Centre today told the Supreme Court (SC) that it is not possible to block online games like the 'Blue Whale Challenge' as they are not app-based games. The SC then directed all state governments to spread awareness among students about the potentially deadly game. The apex court further asked chief secretary of all states to make school-going children aware about the "beauty of life" and the dangers posed by such games. The bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra also directed the Union Human Resources Development Ministry to take requisite steps to inform all schools in the country about the ill-effects of such games. The 'Blue Whale Challenge' gained notoriety when news broke that it was allegedly responsible for the deaths of over 130 youngsters in Russia. Watch: What is the Blue Whale challenge The top court had sought the government's response on a plea seeking to firewall such violent games. The government's response came days after the apex court in October asked it to set up a panel of experts to block life-threatening online games. The plea was filed by a Delhi based activist and advocate Sneha Kalita. The 'Blue Whale Challenge' was termed a 'suicide game'. It manipulated impressionable teenagers to complete a series of challenges, like listening to 'dark songs' and self-harming, and ultimately persuaded them to commit suicide.
