That's why there's little holes everywhere," he said.Also inside were handcuffs, binoculars and even leftover video from an old FBI stakeout, Senfeldas said. There are also several small "pinholes" in the vehicle where cameras can peer out without anyone outside noticing.It has "everything you need to get the investigation done," Senfeldas told WNCN-TV.The auction on eBay ended with 47 bids Monday evening and it appears the van sold for $18,700 -- according to the listing.So far, Senfeldas hasn't contacted the FBI about the van.
