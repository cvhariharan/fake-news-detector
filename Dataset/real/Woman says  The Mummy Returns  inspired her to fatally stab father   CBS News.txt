Her parents called police to say she was suicidal and had a knife when the incident unfolded.During an interview with detectives, Nicassio said she "got played by Hollywood." When asked for clarification, she said "in a movie, someone who can't love someone else, they stab their father" -- saying that's what she took from the "Mummy" film.Nicassio was booked on homicide charges at the Allegheny County Jail.
