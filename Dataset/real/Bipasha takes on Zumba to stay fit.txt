Actress and fitness enthusiast Bipasha Basu says Zumba is her newfound secret to staying fit and that she has never felt so passionate about working out. “I simply love the Zumba programme. I was first attracted to it when I heard its contagious music and rhythms and decided to take a class with renowned Zumba master trainer Sucheta Pal. I was hooked. I have never felt this passionate about fitness.“It’s all about feeling the music, enjoying the moves and allowing it to inspire you to be fitter and healthier,” Bipasha said in a statement. She feels the dance-based exercise routine also gives an emotional boost.“It is not only about physical transformation. The workout actually makes you smile. It’s a great emotional boost to my day and any weight loss is an added bonus,” she added.
