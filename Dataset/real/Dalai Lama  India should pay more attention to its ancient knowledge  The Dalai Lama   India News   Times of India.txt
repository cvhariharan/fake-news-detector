BHUBANESWAR: India should pay more attention to its ancient knowledge, Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama said here on Monday. Speaking to reporters, the Nobel Peace Prize Laureate said that there is some kind of crisis about tackling emotions in the world. "Now in that case, ancient Indian knowledge about tackling emotion is very relevant," he said, beginning his three-day Odisha visit. Stating that the modern education system and technology in India is highly developed, the 82-year-old Buddhist monk said, "That is wonderful, but (in the) meantime, India should pay more attention to ancient year knowledge (on) how to tackle our emotions. That is very important." The spiritual leader, who spoke to media at Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik's residence here after meeting the CM, showered lavish praise on Naveen for "winning people's trust" for so long. Naveen later tweeted, "Honoured to receive His Holiness @DalaiLama at my residence today. Discussed many issues of contemporary importance and sought his blessings and guidance for working towards our state's development and welfare of the people." The Dalai Lama is scheduled to be conferred the 10th "KISS Humanitarian Award" by Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences on Tuesday. The spiritual leader, who is on a week-long three-city tour to Delhi, Bhubaneswar and Kolkata, is scheduled to leave for Kolkata on November 22.
