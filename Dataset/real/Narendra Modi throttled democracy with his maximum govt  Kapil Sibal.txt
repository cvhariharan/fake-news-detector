Congress leader Kapil Sibal on Saturday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government of “disregarding” the Winter Session of Parliament due to the Gujarat Assembly elections. Sibal also attacked Modi for his “off the shelf” Rafale deal, saying that Modi has failed to deliver the “maximum governance” he had promised, and instead “throttled democracy with his maximum government” in the form of Aadhaar intrusion.
