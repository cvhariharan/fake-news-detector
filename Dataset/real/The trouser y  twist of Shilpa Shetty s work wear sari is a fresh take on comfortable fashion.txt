From styling with chic belts to wearing them in dhoti style, Shilpa Shetty has always been able to give a new meaning to a sari. And this time too, she did not disappoint us when she stepped out in a silk sari from the house of Urvashi Kaur.Pairing it with trousers and a shirt, the actor combined separates with six yards, calling it a ‘work sari’. Though we like the concept of comfort fashion, we think stylist Mohit Rai went a little overboard with colours. The multitude of stripes and mismatching colours were a little confusing and we think the plain grey trousers and gold pallu awkwardly stood out, without really blending in.For the accessories, Shetty chose a pair of silver hoops with tassels by Suhani Pittie and sandals from Aprajta Toor rounded off her look nicely. Catch a glimpse of her style here.Minimal make-up and middle-parted hair added finishing touches to her look.
