PATNA: Bihar Congress leaders on Monday burst crackers and distributed sweets among party workers at Sadaqat Ashram here to express their happiness over the Congress Working Committee's (CWC) approval to the schedule for party president's election, possibly paving the way for Rahul Gandhi's elevation as the party chief ahead of the Gujarat polls. As soon as the news of the CWC approval broke out, dozens of senior party leaders led by Bihar Congress president Kaukab Quadri reached the Sadaqat Ashram and burst crackers. A majority of Congress leaders in Bihar believe that the 47-year old leader's election to the top post is a mere formality as no other person would turn up to file his or her nomination. As per the schedule, the process to elect the Congress president will start on December 1 with filing of nomination by prospective candidates. The last date for filing nomination is December 4, until 3 pm. Following scrutiny of nominations on December 5, the list of valid candidates will be published on the same day at 3.30pm. "We strongly believe that Rahul Gandhi will be the sole candidate in the fray and will be declared 'elected unopposed' by the evening of December 4, as no other person will file nomination against him," said a senior functionary of the party. "Congress members across the country have since long been waiting for this day. All Congress workers are happy to know that Rahul Gandhi will take over as the party chief in the next few days," Quadri told TOI. Quadri said the Congress would touch a new height under the able leadership of Rahul Gandhi and the party would regain its lost glory.
