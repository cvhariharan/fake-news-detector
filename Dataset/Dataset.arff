'New Delhi: In a tragic incident, a DSP with Jammu & Kashmir police, Mohammed Ayub Pandith, was beaten to death late last night in the Nowhatta area of Srinagar. Ayub Pandith was deployed for the security of separatist leader Mirwaiz Farooq. After the initial shock and outrage, news channels are now wondering how to cover this particular incident of mob lynching.Explaining the dilemma several media outlets are facing, a senior editor said ,”Well, obviously we can’t ignore this public lynching but at the same time, we can’t cover any lynching if we can’t link it to cows and beef. We are sitting on the horns of dilemma here and initial reports aren’t too encouraging, nobody saw a cow in the vicinity. Therefore, I have asked our ace investigative reporter to go to Srinagar immediately and check for cows within a 10 Kilometer radius of the incident.”When we asked how they will link random cows to the lynching, he said ,”Are you doubting our ability? When we can link Jharkhand lynchings to cows then what is the big deal in Srinagar? We just need to be sure that there were cows in the area. Fact-check is a very important part of journalism today, especially in this post-truth world.”Meanwhile, when Faking News approached the government for their reaction to this barbaric incident, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said ,”Our priority is to provide security to the separatist leaders. As long as they are safe, the situation is under control.”After this statement, several policemen of J&K police declared support for separatists to ensure their safety.',fake
'If you ever wondered how far Comey and his FBI can dive into the Huma Abedin, Clinton e-mails let me inform you.  It’s policy and procedure for the Justice Dept. to give the FBI a  warrant to allow them to  investigate a hi-government official employee such as Abedin for  exposing any national security information. They will examine whether or not material contained in Huma Abudim computer was classified.  Basically, it’s what  the Bureau did in its previous email investigation  about Hillary Clintons e-mail server.The FBI agency had already possessed Weiner’s laptop, but agents were required to obtain a separate warrant to investigate the content of Abedin’s emails. The original warrant obtained for Weiner’s laptop only allowed for examination of content related to his alleged messages with a teenage girl. For the record, Weiner has firmly denied exchanging any inappropriate messages with minors.Now, agents will begin going through the Abedin’s 650,000 or more emails that were discovered on four computers.  She was to have turned these over way back when and she didn’t.However, the FBI only has probable cause to search the emails relevant to the Clinton investigation, so the actual number of emails whose content will be searched is going to be a lower number. Agents may find new information but it’s possible that any emails sent to and from Clinton’s private server have already been seen by the FBI during its previous email investigation.With both warrants allowing the search, Comey wishes they could find pertinent info before Election Day, but federal law enforcement officials anonymously stated that there was “no chance the email review could be completed before Election Day,” due to the highly compressed time period.Senate Democrats want this info out NOW.  They are fueled by frustration and anger over Comey’s decision to re-open the case. It will probably affect the Election. They indicated that by Monday they wish to have “more detailed information about the investigative steps that are being taken, the number of emails involved, and what is being done to determine how many of the emails are a duplication of those already reviewed by the FBI.”These  warrants allow FBI to acquire some important info, but warrants don’t have control over timing and transparency.  Everyone has to wait and see.  It’s a cliff hanger for sure!H/T:  www.Bustle.com',fake

'Christian Anti-Masturbation Mascot Arrested For Public Masturbation At Japanese Embassy\nJimmy Rustling, ABC News \nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/anti-masturbation-mascot-arrested-public-masturbation/\nLos Angeles, CA â€” In an ironic twist of a fate, a mascot for a Christian anti-masturbation organization was arrested today for masturbating in public while at a protest being held at the Japanese Embassy in Los Angeles, California.\n\nFappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, whose real name is 37-year-old Paul Horner, was arrested at the Japanese Consulate after protesters notified police about a man running through their protest with nothing on except a dolphin mascot head while touching himself. Ironically the protest was over Japanâ€™s annual dolphin drive held in the town of Taiji that kills thousands of dolphins a year. During Hornerâ€™s arrest, it was learned he was out on work release from the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility, where he is currently serving eight-years for his 4th arrest of public masturbation along with a charge of aggravated assault on a police officer.\n\nSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she was at the protest when police arrived.\n\nâ€œIt was really weird to see a naked man fondling himself and wearing a dolphinâ€™s mascot head while running through a group of dolphin protesters,â€? Bradley said. â€œI thought maybe it was a stunt the protesters were doing to get more attention but I guess not.â€?\n\nTom Downey with the Los Angeles Police Department, who took Horner into custody, spoke with local news station KABC about the arrest.\n\nâ€œAt first we thought he was possibly intoxicated or mentally unstable, ya know, talking about children and how deadly it is for them to masturbate. Telling us he was at the park with a Christian organization speaking to children about the dangers of masturbation. Saying things like, â€˜They need to stop playing on the Devilâ€™s playground, stop pounding their Devil stick and ringing the Devilâ€™s doorbellâ€™, we thought he was insane,â€? Downey said. â€œTurns out he actually was with this anti-masturbation organization who were accompanying a group of 3rd graders around the park when Horner left the children when he saw images of dolphins on the signs that these protesters were carrying. Mr. Horner said he was â€˜arousedâ€™ by all the pictures of dolphins. We further learned that Mr. Horner has four previous arrests for public masturbation, all while employed by this anti-masturbation organization.â€?\n\n\n\nHorner, along with his organization, Stop Masturbation Now, recently finished a federally funded 31-city nationwide school tour which they claim focused on educating children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation.\n\nLonnie Childs who is president and founder of Stop Masturbation Now spoke with reporters about the future of the organization after this recent setback.\n\nâ€œThanks to your tax dollars, Fappy has helped tens of thousands of children learn to live a masturbation-free lifestyle. During his countless visits to schools around the world, Fappy has collected thousands of signatures from children promising to never masturbate; he has done amazing things,â€? Childs said. â€œIt is a shame how the media is portraying Fappy right now. Paul Horner is a great man. He is passionate about his work, he loves being Fappy and he especially loves the kids. They even have a nickname for him; they call him the tickle monster. But now, all of that is possibly ruined by some trumped-up charges by the Los Angeles five-oh, such a shame.â€? Childs continued, â€œThese lies about Fappy sicken me to my very core. The employees who supposedly observed the incident in question need to be investigated. What is their motive? Are they masturbators? Are they agents of Big Masturbation? What are their crimes? These are the questions that must be addressed. Furthermore, we have found that, over the years, the only thing that Fappy â€œbeatsâ€? are all the fraudulent charges brought against him. I have activated my prayer app and I ask that each and every one of you to keep Fappy in your prayers until this misunderstanding is resolved.â€?\n\n40-year-old Phil Freedom, who was there protesting at the Japanese Embassy, witnessed the act in question.\n\nâ€œThis man just started running around, naked, furiously masturbating and yelling something about how great Donald Trump was. He then put on this dolphin mascot head and attempted to hump one of our protest signs that had an image of a dolphin on it. It was absolutely horrifying.â€?\n\nOn the groupâ€™s Facebook page, news was posted of the arrest.\n\nâ€œAll my faithful Fappy followers, I have some extremely bad news to report. I want you to hear it here first before the liberal media hate machine and Big Masturbation spread their lies about this incident. Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, whose real name is Paul Horner, an inmate at the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility, was out on work release in Los Angeles, California this morning. Fappy, as usual, was educating elementary school children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation. Somehow he got separated from the group and joined up with a dolphin protest at the Japanese Embassy there. It is â€œreportedâ€? by â€œpoliceâ€? that he took off his mascot costume and began running around naked while touching himself. Our lawyers tell us he is being charged with public masturbation, resisting arrest and disorderly conduct. He is currently being held at the Los Angeles Central Jail until a bond is set by a judge, this happening hopefully soon. These are obviously lies, but until we have all the information, please donâ€™t jump to any conclusions. Please keep Fappy in your prayers during this difficult time. Praise Fappy!â€?\n\nHornerâ€™s attorney, Katie Glacier, told ABC News that the dolphin mascot is innocent of these crimes but will continue teaching masturbation prevention while in prison.\n\nâ€œHorner is in good spirits and patiently waiting to see a judge for his bond hearing,â€? Smith said. â€œHorner told me he is innocent, but if found guilty, says he will put an end to inmate masturbation in every jail and prison across the country, starting with the one he is currently serving time at. I personally was not aware of this information about the penal system, but it seems jail is just a hotbed for self-rape and immoral acts. Horner is a saint, a hero, a prophet, and a savior to all the lost heathenish souls out there with deadly masturbation addictions.â€? Glacier continued, â€œThis may be his fifth arrest for masturbating in public, and may be currently serving an eight-year prison term for the same crimes, but that doesnâ€™t mean heâ€™s guilty this time. If Donald Trump was President, this wouldnâ€™t have happened, or if it did, Fappy would be immediately pardoned. I guess at this time, all I can ask is that you please keep Fappy in your prayers during these difficult times.â€?\n\nFappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin and Stop Masturbation Now are federally funded programs designed to teach children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation.

'New Delhi. Thousands of robots from Russia retweeted #RahulBOTAttack, it was learnt by the IT team of OfficeOfRG, amidst the uproar in the TV debates on the same topic. The twitter account of OfficeOfRG has been accused of using BOTs to increase the number of re-tweets to 10s of thousands. The accusation came from the media and BJP amidst Rahul’s tweet supporting a Tamil movie and attacking BJP and the PM in particular.“When we were tasked with increasing the popularity of OfficeOfRG in social media, we believed in technology. After all, we are the technology wing of the party. It is a lot easier to program and train robots compared to that of people with Twitter accounts. A lot of them do not re-tweet. Even a few who re-tweet, always add a disclaimer saying that the RTs are not endorsements. The BOTs would not only re-tweet but also endorse every tweet” the IT wing head told Faking News.“The problem with the Twitter account holders is that they think they are the intellectual community of the social media. Following someone like OfficeOfRG is not a fascinating proposition for many such users. Some in BJP always brag that their leader is an unquestionable leader. In the current political conditions in our country, only OfficeOfRG is the unquestionable leader. The BOTs never question, you know” she further added.“Of course we used the BOTs. How can one get millions of following in just 2 months. In IT, we admit to the tricks. Have you ever seen any programmer denying that 95\% his or her code came from systemic Googling?” the IT wing head candidly admitted to the robotic re-tweets.“We have better following than the BOTs. In fact, our followers are more faithful than the programmed robots. We fondly call them as Bakths” a BJP spokesperson told Faking News.',fake
'Donald Trump: â€œI Will Pay The Legal Fees Of My Followers Who Attack Protestersâ€?\nJimmy Rustling, ABC News\nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/donald-trump-will-pay-the-legal-fees-followers-who-attack-protesters/\nDonald Trump has broken all kinds of norms during his presidential campaign, but today he just went to a whole new level when he announced on Fox News that he will pay any legal fees occurred by his supporters who get into altercations with protesters.\n\nâ€œI know there has been talk of me paying the legal fees of those accused of assaulting protesters at my events and after thinking long and hard about this matter, Iâ€™ve decided I want to go ahead and do that,â€? Trump said. â€œMy followers are passionate about making this country great again and I need to support them in any way that I can. If my followers are arrested, just for being patriotic, loyal, God-fearing Americans, then I will pay their legal fees,â€? Trump continued. â€œI know it could get costly, but itâ€™s time to take a stand against those who cannot conform to a basic set of rules, a system. And these protesters, who still live at home with their mommy and daddy, they hate America, and they hate freedom and they deserve what they get.â€?\n\nToday is the first time Trump has made it official that he will indeed pay the legal fees incurred by his followers in the event of an arrest, but not the first time he has talked about the subject. In February, Trump told a crowd to â€˜knock the crap outâ€™ of protesters and that â€˜I will pay for the legal feesâ€™. Then just days after canceling a rally in Chicago due to violence, Trump said he might pay the legal fees of John McGraw, 78, who sucker-punched a protester at a rally in North Carolina.\n\nâ€œThere used to be consequencesâ€™ for protesting,â€? Trump said. â€œIâ€™m not condoning violence, but what ever happened to the days when police were allowed to just do their job? I remember the Kent State shootings. Were police out of line doing what they did there? How can I be the one to say whatâ€™s right and whatâ€™s wrong? Iâ€™d have to do more research on that. Honestly, Iâ€™d have to look into it, it would be unfair otherwise.â€?\n\nBesides the many protesters at his rallies, Trump also has them online. On March 4th the group Anonymous posted a video declaring â€œtotal warâ€? on the presidential candidate. It hopes to not only bring down many of Trumpâ€™s sites, but also halt his presidential bid by uncovering and exposing embarrassing information.\n\nâ€œWe need you to shut down his campaign and sabotage his brand,â€? said a Guy Fawkes-masked individual in the video. â€œYour inconsistent and hateful campaign has not only shocked the United States of America, you have shocked the entire planet with your appalling actions and ideas.â€?\n\nUsing the hashtag, #OpTrump, the group is asking for help on April 1st to bring down websites that belong to Trump such as, donaldjtrump.com, trump.com, trumpchicago.com, trumphotelcollection.com, donaldtrump2016online.com and citizensfortrump.com.\n\nSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, told ABC News she disapproves of the Trump campaign.\n\nâ€œDonald Trump is bringing out the worst in the worst people. It is only a matter of time before someone gets seriously injured or killed at one of his rallies,â€? Bradley said. â€œTrump has made no attempt to correct his followers on their racist remarks, their bigotry or stop any of their violent outbursts, not once. If their was a Hitler playbook, it would be in Trumpâ€™s back pocket.â€?\n\nTrump finished by saying that he will do what it takes to stop the violence at his rallies.\n\nâ€œThese protesters think they can flip the bird and shout out whatever they want, and Iâ€™m here to say, we wonâ€™t put up with it anymore,â€? Trump said. â€œRemember the civil rights protesters in Selma who attacked police back in the 60â€™s? The police held their ground on something they believed was right, something that would keep America great. And honestly I donâ€™t know exactly what happened there, Iâ€™d have to look into it. You wouldnâ€™t want me to condemn a group that I know nothing about. But what happened to those days?â€?\n\nWashington political analyst, Paul Horner, told ABC News that the problem with the violence generated by Trumpâ€™s supporters starts with Trump himself.\n\nâ€œThis hate and ignorance has always been there, Donald Trump just gave it a place to gather and unite,â€? Horner said. â€œWith four bankruptcies, three wives, despises minorities and the gay community, believes every religion is wrong except his own; Donald Trump is the perfect Republican candidate for President.â€?\n\nTrumpâ€™s campaign has set up a hotline for any of his followers who incur legal charges in the event of an arrest at (785) 273-0325.',fake
'The United States Revokes Scientologyâ€™s Tax-Exempt Status\nJimmy Rustling, ABC News\nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/united-states-revokes-scientologys-tax-exempt-status/\nIn a unanimous decision by the Supreme Court today, the eight justices ruled in favor of revoking the Church of Scientologyâ€™s tax-exempt status in the United States. Under the ruling, Scientology will still be able to operate as a business but no longer as a non-profit religious organization.\n\nThe case was brought forward by the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division after concluding a two-year-long investigation into the inner workings of Scientology. The investigation, along with an extensive audit, found the group to be a â€œcriminal operation with a sole purpose of making moneyâ€?. The eight justices agreed with the IRS and its findings that Scientology was neither a religion or fell under the guidelines of a non-profit charitable organization.\n\nCI Special Agent, Tom Downey, worked closely with IRS Chief Counsel Criminal Tax Attorneys during the course of the investigation.\n\nâ€œIf private schools had similar prices to the courses in Scientology, students would receive the absolute highest level of education by the top educators in the country,â€? Downey said. â€œBut in reality, based on the ridiculously high cost of Scientology, there is no school out there that even exists. The best schools in this country charge a fraction of the exorbitant amounts of money that Scientology charges its members.â€?\n\nPaul Horner, a spokesperson for Scientology, told ABC News the ruling is â€œdiscrimination based on religious beliefsâ€?.\n\nâ€œIn a free country, such as ours, it amazes me that over ten million Scientologists can have their beliefs trampled on like this,â€? Horner said. â€œThe Church of Scientology is working hard to make this world a better place, constructing more buildings and ships and other really neat stuff, and now, most of that will have to be put on hold because of a few religious bigots.â€?\n\nFor years, Scientologyâ€™s claim of ten million followers has been widely disputed. In 2011, former editor, and longtime Scientology foe, Tony Ortega, wrote the following in The Village Voice:\n\nâ€œAccording to the latest survey, the total number of people who identify as Scientologists is just 25,000 in this country of more than 300 million human beings.â€?\n\nScientology teaches that 75 million years ago an evil galactic overlord named Xenu, ruler of a Galactic Confederacy, decided to tackle overpopulation by rounding up 13.5 trillion people in DC-8-like spacecraft, flying them to Earth (then known as Teegeeack), dropping them in the volcanoes of Hawaii and vaporizing them with hydrogen bombs.\n\nTheir spirits, known as thetans, attached themselves to humans at the dawn of man, and according to Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard is the root cause of all our fears, confusion and problems. For humans to reach a clear state, thetans must be removed from the body through therapy sessions, known within Scientology as auditing.\n\nScientology adherents must work through eight stages of auditing over a period of many years to reach this clear state, each of which costs thousands of dollars to partake in. It was these costs that the court took issue with, ruling that they far outstrip average course fees for educational establishments.\n\nSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, told ABC News she lost her family because of Scientologyâ€™s disconnection policy.\n\nâ€œI was born into Scientology,â€? Bradley said. â€œWhen I turned seventeen I began to question some of their beliefs. My family, who are all members, told me to stay quiet, but it was too late and I was excommunicated from the church. Scientologyâ€™s upper management told me I was no longer able to see or talk to my family ever again,â€? Bradley said. â€œIt broke my heart, I couldnâ€™t even say goodbye to them. They were told by Scientology if they had any communication with me that they would be excommunicated too. My family chose Scientology over me.â€? Holding back tears Bradley says, â€œI just hope my family is proud of me, all that Iâ€™m doing with my life and everything Iâ€™m doing to help the homeless. I wish more than anything to see them one day; I love and miss them so much.â€?\n\nDowney told reporters that Scientology spends tens of millions of dollars every year doing what no other religious non-profit organization does.\n\nâ€œThe money is used to harass former members, coerce abortions, to secure their International base so people canâ€™t escape, child abuse, forcing members to disconnect from family and friends who arenâ€™t Scientologist friendly, and to litigate to death anyone who opposes them,â€? Downey said. â€œYears ago, the Cult Awareness Network was an organization that provided information on groups that it considered to be cults. After years of litigation with Scientology and being forced into bankruptcy, it is now a Scientology run enterprise. Over the years Scientology has also put many government officials and politicians in their pocket.â€?\n\nFor years, the Church of Scientology often pointed to their tax-exempt status as proof that it is a recognized religious entity in the United States. And thereâ€™s no disputing that tax-exempt status has been a huge boon to the Scientology industry. With such few members, but billions in real estate holdings, the Church of Scientology has been called â€œthe most famous small business in the world,â€? with its tax exempt status saving the Church an estimated $20 million a year on property taxes alone.\n\nRoberto Sigmond of Amnesty International told ABC News that revoking the Church of Scientologyâ€™s tax-exempt status in the United States is a huge win.\n\n\nYou are from UK and looking to buy Modafinil please have a look at this website where you can buy Modafinil online or learn about it from United Kingdom\n\nâ€œFrom all the deaths Scientology has caused over the years to its phony drug rehabilitation program, this is a great day for anyone that believes in human rights.â€?\n\nAfter originally being recognized as a tax-exempt religious organization in 1957, Scientologyâ€™s tax-exempt status was lost in a 1967 IRS audit. As part of the effort to regain tax exemption during the late 1970s, Scientologists repeatedly infiltrated the IRS, copying large numbers of documents and at one point placing an electronic bugging device in an IRS conference room. These actions took place within a program code-named Operation Snow White. Eleven high-ranking Scientologists, including Hubbardâ€™s wife Mary Sue Hubbard, were sentenced to time in prison for acts surrounding this operation. L. Ron Hubbard himself was named as an unindicted co-conspirator as investigators could not link him to the crimes.\n\nThe United States is not the first country to revoke Scientologyâ€™s tax exemption. In October of last year, a Dutch court revoked Scientologyâ€™s status as a â€œpublic welfare institutionâ€? and the tax exemption that goes along with it.\n\nJanine Pieters, reporting in the NL Times, said the court ruled that sales of Scientologyâ€™s courses and therapy sessions are aimed at profit-making and that it does not therefore belong on the tax authorities charity list.\n\nBeginning April 6th, 2016, The Church of Scientology will no longer receive tax exemption in the United States. Attorneys for Scientology have 30 days to appeal the case, although it is not yet clear whether they will or not.\n\nUPDATE 4/28/16: The Church of Scientology has regained their tax-exempt status within the United States.

This, of course, annoyed the nationâ€™s mega providers, since the higher standard highlights the lack of competition and next-generation upgrades in countless markets. It especially annoyed the nationâ€™s phone companies, given that the expensive, sub-6 Mbps DSL foisted upon millions of customers can no longer even technically be called broadband.\n\nFast forward a year and the broadband providersâ€™ favorite politicians in the House are still whining about the improved definition. In a letter sent to the FCC last week (pdf), the six senators complained that the FCC is on a mad power grab, using a crazy and arbitrary new definition to saddle broadband providers with all manner of onerous regulations. Besides, argued the six Senators, 25 Mbps is more than any American consumer could ever possibly need:\n\nâ€œLOOKING AT THE MARKET FOR BROADBAND APPLICATIONS, WE ARE AWARE OF FEW APPLICATIONS THAT REQUIRE DOWNLOAD SPEEDS OF 25 MBPS. NETFLIX, FOR EXAMPLE, RECOMMENDS A DOWNLOAD SPEED OF 5 MBPS TO RECEIVE HIGH-DEFINITION STREAMING VIDEO, AND AMAZON RECOMMENDS A SPEED OF 3.5 MBPS. IN ADDITION, ACCORDING TO THE FCCâ€™S OWN DATA, THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS WHO CAN PURCHASE 25 MBPS CHOOSE NOT TO.â€?\n\nFocusing on the fact that a single Netflix stream eats just 3.5 to 5 Mbps ignores the fact that broadband connections serve an entire house of hungry users, many of whom will be gobbling significantly more bandwidth using any number of services and connected devices. Itâ€™s also worth pointing out that a single Netflix Ultra HD stream can eat 25 Mbps all by itself. And on the upstream side of the equation, the FCCâ€™s definition of 3 Mbps remains relatively last-generation and arguably pathetic. Similarly, many consumers may not buy 25 Mbps because the lack of competition can result in high prices for faster tiers.\n\nIn other words, claiming 25 Mbps is some kind of â€œarbitrary,â€? pie-in-the-sky standard is absurd.\n\nOf course, the Senators donâ€™t really care about technical specifics, theyâ€™re just blindly echoing the broadband industryâ€™s annoyance that the FCC is now actually highlighting the lack of broadband competition in the market. Theyâ€™re specifically bothered by this recent FCC study, which notes that two-thirds of U.S. households lack the choice of more than one ISP at speeds of 25 Mbps or greater. Companies like AT&T and Verizon also donâ€™t like how this data highlights the fact theyâ€™re giving up on rural America and many second- and third-tier cities, freezing broadband deployments and in some cases even refusing to repair aging infrastructure.\n\nAnd while itâ€™s certainly true the higher standard helps prop up the FCCâ€™s Congressional mandate to ensure quality broadband is deployed in a â€œreasonable and timelyâ€? basis (and by proxy its Title II reclassification), a lot of the FCCâ€™s efforts have quietly involved eliminating regulation, ranging from streamlining tower placement and pole attachment regulations, to eliminating the kind of awful state level protectionist laws that keep municipal and public/private broadband networks from taking root in incumbent duopolist territories.\n\nAt the end of the day, incumbent providers and the politicians who love them are simply annoyed that the FCC has any standards whatsoever, since that makes it immeasurably harder to pretend that the nationâ€™s broadband competition and connectivity issues donâ€™t exist.\n\nThe complaint letter to the FCC:\nThe complaint letter to the FCC\n\nNote from the author: I was tagging this article as â€œRepublicanâ€?. Then I realized that I actually didnâ€™t know what party these six senators were affiliated with, I was just assuming Republican. So I checked, and I was right. Then I laughed. Then I felt sad about this reality.\n\nUPDATE 3/2/16\nI just got a response from Senator Ron Johnson about Net Neutrality. This sentence was in the email: â€œThe term â€œnet neutralityâ€? might sound good, but it is just a clever name for government control of the Internet.â€?\n\nThe whole email is bullshit, but that sentence above made me sick. Heâ€™s using it to manipulate people while getting paid (bribed) by ISPâ€™s to push their agenda thru, attempting to silence free speech. This person has lost all his morals years ago and is nothing but a greedy, evil, shill for whoever can pay him the most moneyâ€¦. and heâ€™ll probably get re-elected again by the same people who he does not serve.\n\n==========\nDear Mr. Horner,\n\nThank you for contacting me regarding the issue of net neutrality.\n\nOn February 26, 2015, unelected bureaucrats at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted 3-2 to impose heavy-handed regulations known as net neutrality on the Internet. The term â€œnet neutralityâ€? might sound good, but it is just a clever name for government control of the Internet.\n\nSince the Clinton administration, the FCC has wisely applied a light regulatory touch to broadband services, resulting in a highly successful broadband industry. The FCC reversed that bipartisan policy decision after consulting with outside interests rather than Congress. The decision is wrong, and the process raises serious questions about the presidentâ€™s inappropriate influence over what is supposed to be an independent agency overseen by Congress.\n\nThank you again for contacting my office. It is very helpful to hear the views of the constituents I serve. To date, my office has received more than 1,800,000 letters, emails and phone calls. My mission is to provide information to as many people as possible concerning the enormous financial and cultural challenges facing America.\n\nPlease see my website at www.ronjohnson.senate.gov for additional information. It is an honor representing you and all the people of Wisconsin.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRon Johnson United States Senator',fake

Thatâ€™s when Phoenix Police were able to apprehend the suspect.â€?\n\nBill Murray, who is in town visiting friends, told ABC News about the incident.\n \nâ€œI saw this man on the sidewalk running towards me with a bag in his hand. Then he suddenly stopped when he saw me. He asked me if I was the zombie Bill Murray from Zombieland. I told him, â€˜sure, why notâ€™. Then he started telling me how much he loved me, and how that was his favorite movie. I was polite, I told him that was very nice of him to say. Then kind of out of nowhere, police showed up and tackled the man,â€? Murray said. â€œSome people might call me a hero, but Iâ€™m no hero. The real heroes today are the men and women of the Phoenix Police Department.â€?\n\n37-year-old Phoenix resident Paul Horner was at the ATM when the robbery occurred.\n\nâ€œI was just standing behind this guy waiting my turn when suddenly he starts busting in the ATM with all these tools,â€? Horner said. â€œHe gets the ATM open and fills a bag up with whatever cash was in the machine, then he runs out the door and down the street. It happened so fast for me to be scared or even get shaken up about it. Though what I am shaken up about is that Bill Murray is the one who stopped this guy and I didnâ€™t get a chance to meet him.â€? Horner continued, â€œBill Murray is my personal hero and today he was an actual hero for the city of Phoenix. What canâ€™t that living legend do?â€?\n\nSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she isnâ€™t surprised by Murrayâ€™s heroics.\n\nâ€œBill Murray is always doing something amazing,â€? Bradley said. â€œI actually met Mr. Murray a while back when we were starting our cause that gives new socks to the homeless. Bill made a donation right there on the spot, saying what we were doing was incredible; heâ€™s such a great guy. He truly cares about people and making the world a better place.â€?\n\nMurray told ABC News he will be in the Valley this week staying with friends and enjoying the sites.\n\nâ€œThis week I plan on going to a couple things with friends and then on Wednesday will probably end up at the Tempe Improv. Thereâ€™s a couple comics playing there that night that Iâ€™ve been wanting to see for a while now. I might tell some jokes if I feel like it, weâ€™ll see. I really like bartending. Maybe theyâ€™ll let me do that. Regardless, it should be a fun time for everyone.â€?\n\nThe robber, whose name has not yet been released, was apprehended and taken into police custody.

'Bill Murray Kicks Off Presidential Campaign In South Carolina With A Bang\nJimmy Rustling, ABC News \nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/bill-murray-kicks-off-presidential-campaign-south-carolina/\nCharleston, SC â€” Just one day after the Democratic Primary, legendary actor, comedian, and writer, Bill Murray, brought his newly announced Presidential campaign to Charleston, South Carolina, speaking to an estimated crowd of over 100,000 cheering fans and supporters.\n\nâ€œHello South Carolina! Are you ready to get weird or what?â€? Murray said to the roaring crowd.\n\nMurrayâ€™s speech, which lasted a little more than an hour, touched on many issues from his campaign, including increased wages, health care, the cost of higher education and human rights in general. The rally also included wine tasting and stages where the people in attendance were allowed to sing karaoke.\n\nâ€œI saw the Republican debate the other night and it made me sick to my stomach,â€? Murray told the crowd. â€œHere are grown men, candidates running for President of the United States, and theyâ€™re acting like 4-year-olds. Theyâ€™re up there on stage, broadcasted to the entire world, calling each other names, interrupting each other, making complete fools of themselves and I just thought to myself; I think the American people deserve better than this. I know we deserve better than this because we are better than this.â€?\n\nPolitical analyst, Paul Horner, told ABC News he has taken an extreme interest in what Murray is doing since he announced his run for President just a little more than a week ago.\n\nâ€œI donâ€™t know if Bill Murray is really running for President or if heâ€™s just having some fun, but the man is making some excellent points out there. Heâ€™s getting people to think about the state their country is in right now and making a lot of people happy while doing it. I applaud Mr. Murray for what heâ€™s doing.â€?\n\nâ€œI pretty much donâ€™t like any of the candidates that are running for President right now,â€? Murray told the crowd, â€œI think Bernie Sanders seems like a decent guy, but the rest of emâ€™, are pretty much complete pond scum in my opinion.â€? Murray continued, â€œIâ€™m always traveling around the world, but Iâ€™m proud to call America, the good oleâ€™ U.S. of A, my home. I think thereâ€™s a lot of great people here, a lot of potential, but thereâ€™s also a lot of confusion and hate right now. People donâ€™t know what to make of these Hitler wanna-beâ€™s like Donald Trump, and the Ted Cruzâ€™s, who want to start World War III. They feed on the hate and paranoia a lot of this country has, and because of that, you see them leading in the polls. And itâ€™s sad that people go along with it, and canâ€™t see it for what it really is.â€?\n\nSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she fully supports Murray and his run for President.\n\nâ€œWe need a new face in Washington. Someone who has no political ties or agenda and canâ€™t be bought,â€? Bradley said. â€œI actually met Bill Murray a while back when we were starting our cause that gives new socks to the homeless.

Look, we donâ€™t need to make America great again, because it already is; we all just need to try a little bit harder and have more love in our hearts for our fellow man. I think if you can take care of yourself and then maybe take care of someone else then thatâ€™s sort of how youâ€™re supposed to live. Lets all help each other make this the best life experience possible!â€?\n\nMurray still has yet to announce if he will be running as an Republican, Democrat or Independent.\n\nDavid Mikkelson, founder of Snopes, a website that takes the fun out of stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.\n\nâ€œThis type of story, when it goes viral, and we debunk it, we make money,â€? Mikkelson said. â€œThe secret behind a good Snopes article is a formula that we have used since day one, itâ€™s actually quite simple. First, we start with the same cookie-cutter outline we use for every site that we debunk. Next, we copy and paste parts of the original article into ours. After that, one of our â€œwritersâ€? will type one or two sentences that talk about the content we just copy and pasted. And now, last but not least, we slap a title on there similar to the articleâ€™s headline that weâ€™re debunking. This way it will show up at the top of Google for anyone searching for that story, and thatâ€™s it! Then we just sit back and let the money roll in. We are the absolute definition of clickbait! Iâ€™ll tell what, if it wasnâ€™t for great writers like Internet news satirist Paul Horner, putting out the stories that he does, my children wouldnâ€™t have been able to go to college.â€? Holding back tears, Mikkelson finishes by saying, â€œThough we are currently being sued by Fox News for calling them a â€œfake news siteâ€?, so lets just hope Paul Horner writes another story soon.â€?\n\nMurrayâ€™s campaign team told reporters their next stop is the Arizona State Capitol on March 2nd and then the Tempe Improv later that night.

'The Unmasking: Ted Cruz is Definitely the Zodiac Killer\nKip LeSale\nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/the-unmasking-ted-cruz-is-definitely-the-zodiac-killer/\nThe Internet is the international online truth machine, and no matter how much the government may try to cover up massive conspiracies, the internet manages to find the truth. People in positions of prominence and authority are the most likely to be involved in such schemes, and as a result, have their secrets uncovered by diligent internet citizens. As such, Ted Cruz, a junior senator from Texas and candidate for the Republican nomination has become the center of a particularly enthralling and convincing conspiracy. We will state it simply: Ted Cruz is definitely the Zodiac Killer.\n\nMost people know quite a bit about the Zodiac Killer, without ever uncovering who he was. He committed a series of killings in the Bay Area of California about forty years ago â€“ resulting in up to three dozen killings â€“ after which the killer, presumed to be Ted Cruz, sent letters to California including a coded message.\n\nThe messages were coded with symbols, forming what is called a â€œcipherâ€?. A cipher is something like this:\n\ndtz itsy sjji yt yjqq rj ymfy ymnx fwynhqj bfx f izrg bfxyj tk ynrj fx n fr fbfwj\n\nThese notes, coded and uncoded, went on for years. The killer was never identified.\n\nUntil now.\n\nThe Claim\n\nSo how did this come back to Cruz? Simply put, various online internet sleuths.\n\nThe Daily Dot, which is to Internet happenings as News Examiner is to reliable news, traced the origin of the Ted Cruz is the Zodiac Killer theory back to 2013 with the following tweet:\n\n#CPAC ALERT: TED CRUZ IS SPEAKING!! HIS SPEECH IS TITLED: â€˜THIS IS THE ZODIAC SPEAKINGâ€™\n\nâ€” RED PILL AMERICA (@REDPILLAMERICA) MARCH 14, 2013\n\nPublic Policy Polling, a left leaning polling firm was convinced by Twitter users to let the truth come to light by including their question on the end of their Florida poll.\n\nzodiac\nIn this poll, nearly 40\% of Floridians believe that there is at least some possibility that Ted Cruz could be the Zodiac Killer. Soon, Snopes, a website definitely bought out by the government to prevent the truth from coming to light, will likely write an article debunking this theory. Do not believe them.\n\nThe Evidence\n\n1) They look scary alike\n\nThe resemblance is uncanny, perhaps besides the portrayal of the Zodiac wearing eyeglasses. The lips, the hairline, and the ears are incredibly similar. Even the chin and facial shape are disgustingly similar. Unfortunately, the person who originally made the Zodiac sketch was probably too high to include Cruzâ€™s signature eyebrows. Not only that, but itâ€™s well established that Cruz has an unsettling facial expression, making it look like he is permanently in a state of disgust, especially when he smiles. Itâ€™s not difficult to deduce â€“ something is clearly bothering him in the back of his mind.\n\n\n\n2) His name appears in at least one encryption\n\nOf course, the most difficult codes to solve would be the ones that give away the identity of the killer. As well, the first 25 characters are able to be decoded to say â€œI, TED CRUZ, AM THE ZODIAC KILLERâ€?.\n\n\n\n3) His campaign logo is a cryptic anagram\n\nEnough said.\n\n4) Heâ€™s definitely a Reptilian Shapeshifter\n\nSites like The Washington Post claim thereâ€™s no way he could have committed the murders due to him being too young at the time of the murders. Unfortunately, those websites are easily paid off to ignore the existence of reptilians. I must ask, why would Ted Cruzâ€™s campaign slogan be â€œTrusTedâ€? if he didnâ€™t have a scaly secret?\n\n\n\n5) He hasnâ€™t denied it\n\nAnd let me reiterateâ€¦ Look at that disgusted smile.\n\nWant to continue to expose Cruz, AKA Zodiac, while helping the women he screwed over in his home state?

Obama told reporters at a press conference today. â€œRepublican Senators believe that it is appropriate not to act on such an important matter, and as I have shown today, I do not agree with that.â€?\n\nHussain, of Muslim heritage, is an attorney who has served as US Special Envoy to the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the second largest intergovernmental body after the UN, and as US Special Envoy for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications. Hussain has also served in the White House Counselâ€™s Office and on the National Security Council as a political appointee of the Obama Administration.\n\n\n\n\n \nEven though under the Constitution, it is the Presidentâ€™s job to nominate Supreme Court justices, Obamaâ€™s selection is already drawing sharp criticism from Republicans. Presidential hopeful Donald Trump told ABC News that he does not agree with the Presidentâ€™s decision.â€?\n\nâ€œHussain is a Muslim and a sympathizer, just like Obama, and now he takes over the legacy the great Antonin Scalia left behind. The President should be ashamed of himself.â€?\n\nâ€œThe American people should have had a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice,â€?

Bradley said. â€œRegardless if you agree with Obamaâ€™s appointed choice of Hussain, Scalia was a disgrace to the Supreme Court. He was a religious radical, a bigot, a racist, against womenâ€™s rights, gay rights and human rights in general; thereâ€™s absolutely no reason a person like that should have ever had power like that in the first place. He will always be remembered as being on the wrong side of history.â€?\n\nDavid Mikkelson, founder of Snopes, a website that takes the fun out of stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, who is also currently being sued by Fox News for calling them a â€œfake news siteâ€?, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.\n\nâ€œThis type of story, when it goes viral, and we debunk it, we make money,â€?

In the lawsuit, Fox is seeking damages caused by an article Snopes published which called the media giant â€œclickbaitâ€? and a â€œfake news siteâ€?.\n\nThe Snopes article at the center of the $20 million lawsuit, titled â€œTRUE: Fox Is A Fake News Site Promoting Fear & Paranoia Through Their Echo Chamber Of Hate & Ignoranceâ€?, which has since has been removed, is shown here in a screen shot that has been posted on various social media websites:\n\nTom Downey, who is a spokesman for Fox News, spoke with ABC News about details of the lawsuit.\n\nâ€œThe Fox News Channel, along with its millions of loyal followers, rely on us heavily, for fair and balanced reporting of events from around the world. The article on Snopes was in extremely bad taste and not funny whatsoever. To say our followers live in an echo chamber of hate and ignorance, and are nothing but a bunch of old, white, bigoted, racists is beyond ridiculous. To say we bring out the worst in the worst people is the definition of libel and slander. We couldnâ€™t have the word â€œnewsâ€? in â€œFox Newsâ€?, unless we were a real news outlet and not â€œfake newsâ€? like Snopes has claimed us to be. I believe any reasonable court in America will agree with the lawsuit and rule in our favor.â€?\n\nSnopes, a website that debunks stories on the internet in order to generate traffic and advertising revenue, told ABC News they are confident in winning the suit.\n\n\n\n\n \nâ€œClickbait is defined as web content that is aimed at generating online advertising revenue, especially at the expense of quality or accuracy, relying on sensationalist headlines to attract click-throughs and to encourage forwarding of the material over online social networks. Well, in that case, technically, any story on the internet that has a clickable headline and ads within their article could be considered clickbait,â€? Snopes founder David Mikkelson said. â€œPersonally I donâ€™t know why Fox is so mad about about us calling them clickbait. I mean, under the definition of clickbait, our website is clickbait. 99\% of the internet is clickbait. I think the only sites out there that you couldnâ€™t call clickbait are those not serving up any kind of ads. And as for Fox claiming not to be â€œfake newsâ€?, I think 99\% of the internet, that same 99\% that is clickbait, would agree with us on that one.â€?\n\nPaul Horner, who Snopes calls, â€œThe prolific writer and ubiquitous satirical character who inserts his name into all his articles,â€? said he has mixed emotions about the lawsuit.\n\nâ€œFox News is pure evil, but I donâ€™t blame them for suing Snopes. They call my articles â€œfake newsâ€? and â€œclickbaitâ€? all the time,â€? Horner said. â€œThroughout the years, I canâ€™t even imagine how much money Iâ€™ve made Snopes because of all the articles they have written about me, my stories and my websites. Seriously, four of my recent stories have been featured on Snopes in the last 6 days alone. With all the money I make them, Iâ€™ve probably put at least a couple of their kids through college by now. And do I even get a Christmas card or even a thank you? No. Well, youâ€™re welcome Snopes. Just remember, I pay your salary.â€?\n\n\n\n\n \nSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, told ABC News that she agrees with Snopes and is sickened by Fox News and their coverage of the media.\n\nâ€œIf itâ€™s a story that will scare people or make them angry, Fox News covers it,â€? Bradley said. â€œThey exaggerate the truth so it fits their agenda of imprisoning minds with fear and hate. They make racism and bigotry worse in this country instead of covering real news stories, something positive, like what we are doing to help the homeless.â€? Bradly continued, â€œFox News only covers how much of a burden the homeless are. Why not try and help them? By helping them, they become less of a burden on the tax payers of this country, thereâ€™s less crime and youâ€™re also helping out your fellow man instead of being selfish and only looking out for yourself. Also, I sincerely want to thank everyone that has supported our cause in giving new socks to the homeless, it means so much! Please, give what you can.â€?\n\nHarvard law professor, Erick Biez, believes Fox News will lose the $20 million lawsuit.\n\nâ€œIt is of my personal opinion that this case falls under fair use laws protected by freedom of speech and using parody to deliver its message,â€? Biez said. â€œThough, if I was Snopes I would still be worried. Theyâ€™ve made a lot of enemies over the years and it was only a matter of time before something like this happened.â€?\n\nThe $20 million lawsuit was filed at the Superior Court of California with opening arguments beginning March 15th.',fake

'2 RINOS: The establishment anti-sovereignty, pro-illegal invasion and anti-American enemy in power, of which John McCain and Paul Ryan represent two of the most vile members, oppose America. They are in opposition to the sovereignty guaranteed in our Constitution and commit treason by working with the  globalists who intend and are striving to eliminate our independent nation, placing us beneath a world government of the UN. That is treason and they should face a jury, but for now they can be held accountable by the voters. William Gheen of ALIPAC, Americans for Legal Immigration PAC, has a plan to do just that.He sent an email out yesterday detailing his plans which also available on their website. Gheen wrote:Americans for Legal Immigration PAC (ALIPAC) has launched an unprecedented strategy today to remove John McCain and Paul Ryan from office Nov. 8 in reaction to both men’s support for Comprehensive Immigration Reform Amnesty for illegals and their efforts to elect Hillary Clinton by undermining the campaign of Donald Trump.“If Republicans like McCain and Ryan are going to act like and help Democrats, why not elect Democrats and try for better Republicans next time?” asked William Gheen of ALIPAC. “If we elect Kirkpatrick and Solen in the place of Ryan and McCain, those pro-amnesty Democrats will be far less powerful and less influential than pro-amnesty McCain and Ryan are serving in the majority party!”ALIPAC has endorsed Donald Trump because of his promise to enforce America’s existing immigration and border laws as the Constitution and American public demand. ALIPAC is fighting to defeat Hillary Clinton, and other Democrats, because they want to turn tens of millions of illegal aliens into Democrat voters dependent upon the state for their housing, food, childcare, education, healthcare, etc…ALIPAC is endorsing Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick (D-Ariz.) vs. John McCain and Democrat Ryan Solen vs. Paul Ryan in the hopes of removing them from power before they do more to help dangerous illegal aliens and Muslim refugees enter America.Ryan Solen recently told media publications that he is already receiving donations from Republican Donald Trump supporters now that Paul Ryan is trying to pull the rug on Trump to help Hillary Clinton. (Republicans deserting Paul Ryan, Democratic opponent claims)ALIPAC believes that if Republicans want to see Paul Ryan and John McCain removed from office, their only choice is to hold their nose and vote Democrat in these two races.“We did our best to remove these treasonous politicians McCain and Ryan in the GOP primary, but we could not compete with the incumbent’s vast amount of wealth and advantages in the corporate social and broadcast media,” says William Gheen, President of Americans for Legal Immigration PAC. “Therefore we are taking the unprecedented step of asking GOP voters to vote for their Democrat challengers only in Wisconsin’s 1st district and Arizona. We oppose all other Democrats because they all support open borders and amnesty for illegals, but we must remove McCain and Ryan because both will oppose Trump’s immigration enforcement efforts or back Hillary Clinton’s amnesty efforts! This bold new strategy will allow a small group of Republicans that know the deal to rid America of these corrupt politicians and these two seats will not shift the balance of power to the Democrats in the Senate and House!”Americans for Legal Immigration PAC was founded on 9/11 of 2004 in honor of the victims of 9/11. Since that time the organization has played a key role in defeating amnesty legislation in Washington DC in 2006, 2007, 2010, 2013, and 2014. ALIPAC has also led the charge to defeat state legislation that would have provided licenses and in-state tuition for illegal aliens in 25 states!The organization is currently endorsing 50 incumbent Republicans that share the organization’s opposition to illegal immigration, open borders, and amnesty. (Click to view List)That list rises to 52 endorsements as of today with the addition of Democrats Ann Kirkpatrick and Ryan Solen.ALIPAC will be launching online ads and radio commercials into these races to help sway Republicans to vote Democrat against McCain and Ryan.It’s not like either of these guys votes the way any of us would if we were in office.

'Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation v. Paul Horner\nJimmy Rustling, ABC News\nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/fox-news-v-paul-horner/\nRESPONSE BY PAUL HORNER\n\nTo: Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, Complainant & National Arbitration Forum\nFrom: Private Registrant / Respondent / Paul Horner\nDate: April 4, 2016\nRe: Domain name FOXNEWS.COM.CO\nHello friends,\n\nHere is my response with exhibits attached. Thank you for your time and have a great day!\nBest Regards,\n\nPaul Horner\nTel: 480-828-0740\nnetskrillsupport@gmail.com\nBACKGROUND FACTS\nA. About Paul Horner\n\nPaul Horner is a political satirist, writer, stand up comedian and founder of a charity that gives socks to the homeless called sockitforward.com. See Exhibit 10 and Exhibit 14.\n\nLinks to interview and info about â€˜Sock It Forwardâ€™:\nhttp://ktar.com/player/?a=318283\nhttp://ktar.com/story/853803/faith-in-humanity-group-passes-out-socks-to-phoenix-homeless/\nThe NY Post calls Paul Horner an â€œonline jokesterâ€? in reference to an article that was published on foxnews.com.co. See Exhibit 11.\nhttp://nypost.com/2016/01/20/someone-convinced-the-internet-that-bill-murray-is-running-for-president/\n\nWhat Wikipedia says about Paul Horner writing for the parody website NationalReport.net:\n\nâ€œPaul Horner was the publicationâ€™s lead writer, his employment began shortly after National Report went online. Horner is an Internet news satirist and article writer for numerous online satirical news sites.â€? See Exhibit 12.\nSnopes says, â€œPaul Horner, the prolific writer and ubiquitous satirical character who inserts his name into all his articles.â€?\nhttp://www.snopes.com/2016/01/14/fake-news-sites/\n\nThe Washington Post calls Paul Horner, â€œThe Internetâ€™s most prolific hoax artist.â€?\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2014/10/21/this-is-not-an-interview-with-banksy/\nInternational Business Times says, â€œPaul Horner, the worldâ€™s biggest penis and the everyman of Internet hoax history.â€? See Exhibit 15.\nhttp://www.ibtimes.co.uk/banksy-arrested-paul-horner-worlds-biggest-penis-everyman-internet-hoax-history-1470892\n\nMaxim Magazine says Paul Hornerâ€™s sites are satirical and just like International Business Times, agrees that he does in fact have the biggest penis the world. See Exhibit 16.\nhttp://www.maxim.com/entertainment/yelp-south-park-hoax-2015-10\nRed State is just one of the many, many sites on the Internet that say Paul Hornerâ€™s news sites are satire. See Exhibit 17.\nhttp://www.redstate.com/streiff/2016/03/26/corey-lewandowski-ann-coulter-punked-satire-web-site/\n\nB. About FoxNews.com.co\n\nFoxNews.com.co is a parody website.\n\nThe Respondent has six other parody news sites. The Respondent uses FoxNews.com.co to post articles that would be absolutely ridiculous for the real FoxNews.com to publish. The articles on FoxNews.com.co mock Fox News, making the articles & website all that more hilarious, satirical and parody.\n\nSince being registered only back on 1/13/16, FoxNews.com.co cannot be judged for its lack of content since the site is so new and the Respondent is the only author.\n\nBesides the Respondentâ€™s few articles, the rest of the site is just the theme which came default, filled with pages and posts in Latin (also default). Proving the point that foxnews.com.co is just ridiculous and parody, and no one, after viewing those pages in Latin would believe this is owned by a multi-billion dollar company such as Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation.\n\nThe popular online website Reddit.com classifies articles posted by foxnews.com.co as â€œsatireâ€?. See Exhibit 19.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/4bs6qn/christian_antimasturbation_mascot_arrested_for/\n\nRespondentâ€™s articles are written in English, or Latin on pages that came with the theme of the website as default, and the .com.co extension is from Columbia. In addition to that, according to Snopes.com, if a domain name ends with a .com.co extension at the end, it is a parody website.\n\nRespondentâ€™s disclaimer that is at the bottom of every page is parody. It claims that Fox News is proudly owned by Dr. Paul Horner. The complaint phone number listed, that the site encourages people to call, is for the Westboro Baptist Church. It also talks about treating those seeking help for â€œself-rapeâ€? and to get off the Devilâ€™s playground with the assistance of an anti-masturbation dolphin named â€œFappyâ€?. See Exhibit 8.\n\nBecause of this, the entire site is clearly satire and covered under fair use parody laws.\n\n1. Respondentâ€™s SUPPOSED Infringing Activities and Bad-Faith Acts with FoxNews.com.de\n\nRespondent responded to Complainantâ€™s request to transfer the name on 8/5/15. See Exhibit 18.\n\nThe Complainant did not respond to the email, instead they went directly to the Registrar and took the name by force; this was told to the Respondent by 101domains.com. Fox took the domain name foxnews.com.de without permission from the Respondent. Just like FoxNews.com.co, FoxNews.com.de had content that was made up entirely of parody and satire.\n2. Complainant claims that the Respondent seeks to financially benefit from foxnews.com.co by offering to sell the Domain Name for $699 on the domain-marketplace website Sedo\n\nSedo listed my domain name for sale without my permission. I have never offered to sell foxnews.com.co and have no intentions to sell it in the future, with Sedo or anyone else. In fact, this problem with Sedo is so common that they list this information on their website as a common question:\n\nWhy do I see my domain listed for sale on Sedo when I have not listed it for sale?\nhttps://sedo-us1.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2282/~/why-do-i-see-my-domain-listed-for-sale-on-sedo-when-i-have-not-listed-it-for\n\nI used their form to have foxnews.com.co removed from their website. See Exhibit 4.\n\nI received a reference number #160331-001745. See Exhibit 5.\n\nI also received email confirmation. See Exhibit 6.\n\nOn March 31st, 2016 I received email confirmation that their unauthorized listing for the sale of my domain name will be removed within 24 hours. See Exhibit 7.\n\nFollowing up on March 3rd, 2016: A quick check of the page that Sedo previously had my domain name listed for sale is no longer there. Their unauthorized attempt at selling my domain name without my permission has been removed. See Exhibit 9.\n\n3. FoxNews.com.co is protected under fair use of copyrighted works and parody laws\n\nParody: An imitation of the style of a particular writer, artist, or genre with deliberate exaggeration for comic effect.\n\nFox News and their trademark is for:\nâ€œENTERTAINMENT SERVICES IN THE NATURE OF TELEVISION NEWS PROGRAMMINGâ€?. See Exhibit 21.\n\nFoxNews.com.co is an online website with articles that are satirical, mocking Fox News using parody.\n\nThe fair use of copyrighted works for purposes such as criticism or comment is not an infringement of copyright.\nThe idea of fair use reflects copyright lawâ€™s careful consideration of First Amendment principles, as fair use permits later authors â€œto use a previous authorâ€™s copyright to introduce new ideas or concepts to the public.â€?\n\nPrevious domain name and court cases won over parody:\n\n1. CFA Properties, Inc. v. Domains By Proxy, LLC and John Selvig Case No. D2012-1618\n2. Beck v. Eiland-Hall\n3. See eg, Elsmere Music, Inc v. National Broadcasting Co., 482 F. Supp. 741, 747 (S.D.N.Y. 1980), affâ€™d, 623 F.2d 252 (2d Cir. 1980) (finding Saturday Night Liveâ€™s use of â€œI Love Sodomâ€? to be protected parody of â€œI Love New Yorkâ€?).\n4. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. wallmartcanadasucks.com and Kenneth J. Harvey Case No. D2000-1104\n\nIn the case of Fox News Network, LLC, v. Penguin Group (USA), Inc., and Alan S. Franken, Judge Chin said the case was an easy one (siding for Franken), and chided Fox for bringing its complaint to court. The judge said, â€œOf course, it is ironic that a media company that should be fighting for the First Amendment is trying to undermine it.â€?\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_v._Franken\n\n4. The stories published on FoxNews.com.co are not confusing to stories FoxNews.com would publish\n\nThe Respondent believes that Fox and its website FoxNews.com are pure evil. It is the Respondentâ€™s opinion that they are the absolute definition of dumbing down the human race, accepting the idea to not question authority, religion, a police state, spreading hate and ignorance and the worse thing that has happened to mankind since the Bubonic plague. Respondentâ€™s website FoxNews.com.co mocks this evil incarnate with parody.\n\nThe Respondent has only owned foxnews.com.co since 1/13/16, and in that time has published articles showing proof that Ted Cruz is the Zodiac Killer, how Fox News is NOT â€˜fair and balancedâ€™ as they claim, and other stories Fox News would never publish. FoxNews.com.co cannot be judged for its lack of content since the the site is so new and the Respondent is the only author.\n\nFor April Fools day:\nhttp://foxnews.com.co/fox-fair-balanced-source-news/\n\nThe Unmasking: Ted Cruz is Definitely the Zodiac Killer\nhttp://foxnews.com.co/the-unmasking-ted-cruz-is-definitely-the-zodiac-killer/\n\nChristian Anti-Masturbation Mascot Arrested For Public Masturbation\nhttp://foxnews.com.co/christian-anti-masturbation-mascot-arrested-public-masturbation/\n\n5. Anything that was done with a federal court and two UDRP Panelists in the past has nothing to do with this case.\n\nThe Complainant argues that things the Respondent did 15+ years ago with Amazon and Microsoft are somehow relevant to this case.\n\nThis case is about the rights that fall under fair use parody laws. Those cases the Complainant includes in their filing has nothing to do with parody laws. With that being said, everything they say about the Respondent, those two UDRP decisions and a court ruling in federal court are irrelevant.\n6. Fox News is commonly mocked and parodied\n\nAs owner of foxnews.com.co, Respondent is not the first to be a part of a much larger group that mocks Fox News with parody for its lack of fact-checking, mixing politics and religion, its far right-wing agenda etc.\n\nIn fact, back in October of 2013, Fox News aired a story on Live television that was written by the Respondent while writing for the parody website NationalReport.net. The story was about President Barack Obama using his own money to keep a Muslim museum open during the government shutdown.\n\nFox Falls For Fake Story About Obama Personally Funding Muslim Museum During Shutdown\nhttp://mediamatters.org/blog/2013/10/05/fox-falls-for-fake-story-about-obama-personally/196304\n\nJimmy Kimmel lampoons Fox News for falling for â€˜Muslim museumâ€™ hoax\nhttp://www.rawstory.com/2013/10/kimmel-lampoons-fox-news-for-falling-for-muslim-museum-hoax/\n\nFox has a history of passing off satirical stories as actual news:\nhttp://mediamatters.org/blog/2011/11/01/fox-falls-for-fake-occupy-protester-quote-from/182992\nhttp://mediamatters.org/research/2008/06/06/gullible-fox-amp-friends-escape-lawsuit-for-rep/143677\nhttp://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/feb/26/fact-checks-behind-daily-shows-50-fox-news-lies/\n\nIf the websites mentioned above are not to your liking, a simple Google search of â€œFox News Liesâ€?, â€œFaux Newsâ€? or â€œFox News sucksâ€? will provide hundreds of other articles and websites.\n\n7. Digital Privacy Corporation\n\nThe Complainant says the Respondent is associated with the â€˜Digital Privacy Corporationâ€™. This is the private registration that is used by 101domains.com, the company foxnews.com.co was purchased through. The Respondent has no options when it comes to private registration when buying domain names through 101domains.com.The Respondent only mentions this fact if this somehow has anything to do with the decision made by the National Arbitration Forum and the panelist deciding this case. See Exhibit 20.\n\nCERTIFICATION\nRespondent certifies that the information contained in this response is to the best of the Respondentâ€™s knowledge.\nREMEDIES AND REQUESTED RELIEF\nRespondent requests that the domain name FOXNEWS.COM.CO not be transferred to Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation and the Respondent continues ownership.\nRespectfully Submitted,\nPaul Horner',fake
'New Delhi: A man aged 20 years was admitted to hospital as he collapsed from shock at being offered a seat in the Delhi Metro. Doctors have since diagnosed him with the Privileged Victim Syndrome (PVS) and say that this accident might have helped save his life. He would have probably lost his life if the disorder wasn’t treated soon.The condition is highly prevalent in urban areas among upper-class young males. It causes patients to become insensitive to the plight of disadvantaged social groups and makes them angry at the ‘special treatment’ that others get but they are denied.The patient spoke to us about his condition. “It is quite exhausting to be nice to everyone. This incident has helped me realize that I was going through the trauma of being denied the right to misbehave in my own country. Can you imagine having to struggle to get a good education? Can you imagine having to respect women when I don’t even think of them as human beings? Why am I being made to feel as if I’m not the second-most important person in the country?

'Why Bernie Sanders Is Actually Winning: The Delegate Count Explained In 5 Easy Steps\nJimmy Rustling, ABC News \nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/bernie-sanders-actually-winning-delegate-count-explained-5-easy-steps/\nConcord, NH â€” Though Bernie Sanders won the New Hampshire primary in a landslide over Hillary Clinton, he will likely receive fewer delegates than she will. But does that really matter? The simple answer is â€˜noâ€™ and let me explain why.\n\nSanders won 60 percent of the vote, but thanks to the Democratic Partyâ€™s nominating system, he leaves the Granite State with at least 13 delegates while she leaves with at least 15 delegates.\n\nNew Hampshire has 24 â€œpledgedâ€? delegates, which are allotted based on the popular vote. Sanders has 13, and Clinton has 9, with 2 currently allotted to neither.\n\nBut under Democratic National Committee rules, New Hampshire also has 8 â€œsuperdelegates,â€? party officials who are free to commit to whomever they like, regardless of how their state votes. Their votes count the same as delegates won through the primary.\n\nNew Hampshire has 8 superdelegates, 6 of which are committed to Hillary Clinton, giving her a total of 15 delegates from New Hampshire as of Wednesday.\n\nThe stateâ€™s 2 remaining superdelegates remain uncommitted.\n\n\n\n\n \nSo after a razor-thin victory in Iowa and a shellacking in New Hampshire, Clinton has 394 delegates, both super and electorally assigned, to only 42 for Sanders. Now here is where it gets interesting:\n\nFor a delegateâ€™s vote to count, the number of people that turned out to vote must be greater than 40\% and less than 65\% of the total population in that state.\n\nSince more than 65\% of Iowans voted this year, this makes a 2 for 1 situation under the DNCâ€™s current rules. And since the people of Iowa that did get out that day to vote outnumbered the percentage of superdelegates, then that means Sanders actually won Iowa. So since the superdelegates no longer matter, under DNC rules, you can see that the current delegate count for Clinton would now be 280, both super and electorally assigned. But it gets better than that for Sanders.\n\nUnder the Winter Solstice rules of the DNC, it is common for the delegate count to be in a state of â€œParidismâ€? or confusion. This is due to the fact that the March Equinox has not yet arrived. So because of this, it gives way for an amount of delegates that has yet to even be counted. So going with the current percentages of 61.05\% under ABR rule 5-78a, this means that Sanders will increase his delegate â€œpowerâ€? or â€œdelegate strengthâ€? in the current DNC format by 10 fold, once March 1st comes, of course.\n\nSo now, factoring in these easy to understand numbers, you can see that the current count, come March 1st would give Clinton 230 delegates and Sanders 206.\n\nThis sounds great, right? Well, it gets better for Sanders.\n\nBecause of the even-odd system set in place by the DNC, a superdelegate vote, on an even load, depending on the backlog of DBW votes (total), would supersede the current count by more than 57\%, thus giving Sanders an additional 26 delegates, come the March Equinox, and based on the DNCâ€™s rules of over-under and HQL8-ia. That factored in with D12 and its current and ex-members, including Bizarre, along with the DNCâ€™s current rules and regulations, you can see the new count would have Sanders in the lead with 232 delegates and Clinton with only 204.\n\nOnce you understand how delegates and superdelegates work in the electoral process, it really is quite something. One may argue that instead of all this, you could simply add up the total amount of votes by the people and whoever gets the most votes would be the winner, but then you would not be following the timeless tradition in which we all call â€œvotingâ€?.\n\nPetition: Superdelegates; Donâ€™t Deny Democracy',fake
'Vince Gilligan Announces Breaking Bad Season 6; Returns This Summer â€“ Walt Did Not Die!\nJimmy Rustling, ABC News \nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/vince-gilligan-announces-breaking-bad-season-6-returns-this-summer/\nHollywood, CA â€” Breaking Bad fans around the world are celebrating the stunning, glorious and amazing news that was announced today: Walter White is not dead, and there will indeed be a sixth season of the wildly-popular, award-winning AMC drama.\n\nThis shocking and exciting news comes not from an internet message board or the rumor mill but from series creator Vince Gilligan. In an exclusive ABC News interview, Gilligan dropped the bombshell.\n\nâ€œWalter White is not dead, and neither is Breaking Bad,â€? said the 48-year-old writer, director, and executive producer of the groundbreaking show.\n\nâ€œWeâ€™ve kept it under wraps for months, now the catâ€™s out of the bag. Season 6 is coming, and itâ€™s going to be epic and true to the fans that have followed the show so incessantly.â€?\n\nGilligan explained his decision to continue with the popular series.\n\n\n\n\n \nâ€œI just couldnâ€™t walk away from it. This isnâ€™t a cash-grab or a sophomoric attempt to bastardize what was such a beautiful ending to season 5. Iâ€™ve invested so much of myself in these characters that Iâ€™d always had an inkling Iâ€™d return to it, even outside [the] Better Call Saul [spin-off]. The kicker was Iâ€™d need a spark, something that made it make sense for these stories to continue.â€?\n\nThe series star Bryan Cranston seemed to drop a major hint in an interview with CNNâ€™s Ashleigh Banfield back in May. Asked by Banfield if his character, Walter White, died or not, Cranston said, â€œHey, you never saw bags zip up or anything. Or say â€¦ you know.â€?\n\nGilligan explained how the decision came about to do a season six.\n\nâ€œBryan [Cranston] called me up and said he had this incredibly lucid dream in which Walt wakes up in a hospital bed surrounded by the DEA, ends up breaking out of prison and finds out heâ€™s got fans,â€? Gilligan said. â€œThis isnâ€™t a redemption story, itâ€™s got a bleak, dark premise. I canâ€™t give away any more of the details, but letâ€™s just say Walt has quite a bit of unfinished business to attend to, and it sure as hell has nothing to do with teaching high school science.â€?\n\nAccording to Gilligan, the entire cast agreed to return for at least one more season. This includes Bob Odenkirk, star of Better Call Saul, the prequel comedy series with season two beginning February 15th.\n\nâ€œIâ€™m not surprised in the least that Vince was going back to Breaking Bad,â€? said Odenkirk. â€œBefore we began shooting this new season, I was working with him on the set, and the last few times I had seen him, he had sort of a glint in his eye, a bounce to his step. He was laughing at a bunch of jokes I couldnâ€™t pull off two years ago. I mean, comedy and drama can be radically different, and no one does drama like Vince. Season 6 will be great, I just know it, and I canâ€™t wait to see where this journey takes us.â€?\n\nSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that gives new socks to the homeless and those less fortunate, told ABC News she is excited that Gilligan will be featuring the group in the upcoming season.\n\n\nYou are from UK and looking to buy Modafinil please have a look at this website where you can buy Modafinil online or learn about it from United Kingdom\n\nâ€œIâ€™m just thrilled that Vine [Gilligan] is using our name and group in season six of Breaking Bad,â€? Bradley said. â€œWe have so many great scenes and dialogue in season six, it is so fantastic. This will definitely increase the amount of donations we receive and put so many more brand new pairs of socks on the feet of homeless people. Please give what you can, every dollar puts at least one new pair of socks on the foot of someone less fortunate.â€?\n\n\n\n\n \nDavid Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, upon hearing the announcement by Gilligan confirmed the news with ABC News.\n\nâ€œYes, itâ€™s true. I have a friend, Tom Downey, who is a writer for the show who told me everything. You donâ€™t know how much of a relief this is to finally get this off my back. Iâ€™ve been keeping this a secret for six long months now, I was ready to explode,â€? Mikkelson said. â€œHereâ€™s a little spoiler for all you fans out there so stop reading right now if you donâ€™t want any information, otherwise, lets go. Season six begins with Walt waking up in the hospital, handcuffed to his bed. Like Bryan [Cranston] said last May, nobody ever saw a body bag, so essentially, the last episode of Season 5 was left open-ended. Skyler, Walt Jr., Marieâ€¦ none of them have any idea heâ€™s survived, but the DEA is right on top of it. Weâ€™ll go through the motions of people finding out heâ€™s alive â€“ many people wanted Walt dead, so thereâ€™s a lot of disconcerted, angry people out there. We have Walt going to trial, his incarceration and how heâ€™s keeping Heisenberg and the blue meth on the streets during his imprisonment. Season 6 will have Waltâ€™s eventual breakout, despite the fact that heâ€™s being held prisoner in a fashion not seen since Hannibal Lecter. The nationwide manhunt for Jesse Pinkman is both epic and gripping, and I can tell you for certain his relationship with Walt will continue, in a much more strained, arch-nemesis-type fashion. None of this is anything you wonâ€™t find out about in the trailer, but itâ€™s high time to get truly, truly excited for the greatest show of all time! I believe in this, itâ€™s a valid and worthwhile continuation of something that deserves discernment and care. Breaking Bad Season 6! Itâ€™s not over yet!â€?\n\nFor comedic relief in season 6, a Christian anti-masturbation organizationâ€™s mascot named Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin will be joining the crew. Fappy, played by newcomer 37-year-old Paul Horner from Phoenix, Arizona, told ABC News he is excited about the role.\n\nâ€œIâ€™m not familiar with the show, honestly if itâ€™s not in the Bible I probably havenâ€™t heard about it,â€? Horner said. â€œA couple months ago, the great Lonnie Childs, president of Stop Masturbation Now, contacted me and asked if I wanted to be in one of those moving picture shows about breaking stuff badly and smoking methamphetamine. I told him I had never tried meth before, but the people at the bus stop look like theyâ€™re having a good time. I also told him I was interested in the part, but just as long as the breaking show had no self-rape or homogayness in it. He assured me it didnâ€™t, so I said, sure, why not!â€? Horner continued, â€œI think this is a perfect platform to help spread awareness about the dangers and consequences of masturbation. This is going to be so much fun! Praise Lonnie Childs! Praise Fappy!â€?\n\nThe original series won multiple awards, including ten Primetime Emmys. Out of 267 nominations, Breaking Bad has garnered 101 trophies. Breaking Bad: Season 6 is set to return sometime this summer.',fake
'Obama Signs Executive Order Allowing Muslims To Swear On Quran Instead Of Bible In Court\nJimmy Rustling, ABC News\nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/executive-order-allows-muslims-to-swear-on-quran-instead-of-bible/\nWASHINGTON â€” President Barack Obama signed an executive order today that allows Muslims to swear on the Quran instead of the Bible before testifying in a court of law.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference this afternoon, Obama explained the reasons behind his decision.\n\nâ€œItâ€™s time we recognize the Muslim people and their religion in this country and give them all the exact same rights as every other American,â€? Obama said. â€œThere is no reason that a Muslim should have to take an oath on a book that he or she does not believe in. We need to respect the Muslim people and their beliefs and that is what I have done today by issuing this executive order.â€?\n\n\n\n\n \nThe most significant effect of the executive order is the new oath. As it currently stands, before testifying, a bailiff will ask the person on the stand to place their left hand on the Bible, raise their right hand and say, â€œDo you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?â€? With the new oath, while the Muslim has their right hand raised and left hand placed on the Quran, the bailiff will ask them, â€œDo you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you Allah?â€?\n\nKhaled Matei who is a member of the Muslim Brotherhoodâ€˜s Freedom and Justice Party told ABC News he is pleased with Obama and his actions.\n\nâ€œI spoke with President Obama by telephone today and personally thanked him for what he is doing to help the Muslim community,â€? Matei said. â€œThis is definitely a step in the right direction I explained to him. Praise Allah.â€?\n\nâ€œItâ€™s no wonder we have so many problems in this country,â€? David Mikkelson from Snopes.com said. â€œIf Iâ€™d had my wits about me Iâ€™d have told them that taking God out of the courtroom is only going to result in more criminals and murderers. I donâ€™t know what can be done about it, but itâ€™s time for us to step up and DO something.â€?\n\nSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, told ABC News that she agrees with Obamaâ€™s decision.\n\n\n\n\n \nâ€œI think itâ€™s only fair that we allow Muslims the same rights that Christians have in this country. Why should a Muslim person have to take an oath on a book they donâ€™t believe in?â€? Bradley said. â€œEveryone in this country needs to be treated fairly, and that is why we dedicate so much of our time in helping the homeless. I sincerely want to thank everyone that has supported our cause by donating money or new socks, it means so much! In addition to that, Iâ€™m proud to say that Sock It Forward will be at the Phoenix Open all this week thanks to donations from Uber and Stance Socks, I swear to God,â€? Bradley laughed.\n\nFappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, whose real name is Paul Horner, is a mascot for a Christian organization that travels around the country speaking to elementary school children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, told ABC News he does not agree with what Obama is doing.\n\nâ€œAll Muslims do all day is sit around and self-rape,â€? Horner said. â€œAnd now this Muslim president of ours, wants to give Muslims the exact same rights as us loving and caring Christians have? Itâ€™s pathetic and unconstitutional! America could be great again, but not with Muslims running around here, blowing everything up, and masturbating.â€?\n\nCourt rooms also allow affirmations to those who object to taking an oath. An affirmation has exactly the same legal effect as an oath, but is usually taken to avoid the religious implications of an oath; it is thus legally binding but not considered a religious oath.\n\nThe new executive order that allows Muslims to swear on the Quran in court instead of the Bible takes effect March 1st.',fake
'DNC Involved in Joint Investigation into Clinton Coin Toss\nKip LeSale \nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/dnc-involved-in-joint-investigation-into-clinton-coin-toss/\nDES MOINES, IOWA A full scale investigation has been launched following a discovery of potential corruption in the Iowa caucus by a local. Black Box Voting, a nonpartisan investigative organization dedicated to preserving the integrity of elections has joined with the Democratic National Committee over allegations that a coin toss to decide six total delegates for Secretary Hillary Clinton over Senator Bernie Sanders was fixed in her favor.\n\nWATCH: Hillary Clinton won six delegates on Monday in six tied political regons by coin toss, the legitimacy of which has been called into question.\n\n\n\n\n \nABC News interviewed Liz Krupa, the 19 year old who claims to have found evidence of Clintonâ€™s fraud.\n\nâ€œWell, I was shocked a coin flip was considered a fair way to decide delegates in the case of a tie.

I saw Sanders lose the flip, and all I could think about was when I was in elementary school I used to bend coins with my teeth in order to give myself an unfair advantage over bets.â€? With that thought, when Liz saw the caucus worker put the coin on a table, it was her immediate reaction to grab it. â€œI felt bad for taking it, but I ended up getting out my phone and I recorded myself flipping it seven times before two big men noticed me. Every flip was tails.â€? At this point, the coin was taken back from Krupa, and the men, likely security guards, insisted that she delete the video she had taken, and then tried to confiscate her phone. When she refused, the men physically and forcibly removed her from the Desmond caucus location. â€œI was thinking, maybe this was just strange chance. It wasnâ€™t until security acted forcibly towards me that I knew I needed to send the video somewhere for investigation.â€?\n\nHillary Clinton has come under fire for several controversies recently, the most recent being a massive scandal with government emails being stored on a private server. As a result, she has gained the reputation among many voters to be dishonest. She won six out of six total delegates in the coin toss, giving her an extra edge in over Sanders, who nearly tied with her for votes. Statistically, the chance of Clinton winning all six coin tosses is a mere 1.6\%. Once Black Box Voting received the video, they promptly launched an investigation, with the Democratic National Committee joining the investigation soon after.\n\nWhen CBS News asked Lisa Heddons, the woman who flipped the coin in Desmond, on early Tuesday who she supported in her bid for the president, she originally maintained a position of no bias. However, with later pressing, she admitted she favored Clinton over Sanders. When CBS News began to press further questions about the legitimacy of the coin toss, interviewers were swiftly and curtly asked to leave.\n\nBlack Box Voting refuses to make an official statement claiming whether this case is being considered fraud currently. Regrettably, they will also not release the video of the coin flip until further study of the legitimacy of the local video and investigation into Clintonâ€™s campaign are concluded.\n\nABC News will continue to bring the most up-to-date news on the matter.',fake
'Ted Cruz Ups The Stakes: â€œIf Trump Debates Me One-On-One, I Will Wear Makeupâ€?\nJimmy Rustling, ABC News\nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/cruz-will-wear-makeup-if-trump-accepts-one-one-debate/\nDes Moines, Iowa â€” The Super Pacâ€™s supporting Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz have upped the ante in hope that a one-on-one debate with Donald Trump happens.\n\nâ€œSince we have not heard back from Donald Trump, weâ€™ve decided to up the stakes. Weâ€™re confident that Trump will chicken out, but if he doesnâ€™t, and does debate Ted Cruz one-on-one, in addition to us donating $1.5 million to veterans, Cruz will also wear womanâ€™s makeup during the entire debate,â€? Paul Horner, a spokesman for the Keep the Promise I Super PAC said. â€œThere is no way that Trumpâ€™s ego can pass up an offer this good,â€? Horner laughs.\n\nAt a rally Wednesday, Cruz renewed his proposal to Trump for a separate one-on-one debate, after the billionaire candidate announced heâ€™d skip Thursdayâ€™s debate because he objects to moderator Megyn Kelly.\n\n\n\n\n \nâ€œIf Donald finds Megyn so terribly frightening, I yesterday suggested an alternative. He and I are the leading candidates in this state right now, so how about the two of us in a one on one debate mano-a-mano?â€? Cruz told the crowd. â€œAnd Iâ€™m going to propose a venue: Western Iowa Tech, Saturday night in Sioux City â€” we already have it reserved.â€?\n\nThen, he laid out the conditions: â€œEight oâ€™clock, Saturday night. A two-hour, one-on-one debate. Now, if gentle Donald cannot handle Megyn Kelly, how about â€” for a moderator, instead â€” Mark Levin? Or if he doesnâ€™t like Mark Levin, how about Sean Hannity? And if he doesnâ€™t like Sean Hannity, how about Rush Limbaugh?â€?\n\nAnd if none of the three conservative radio hosts met with Trumpâ€™s approval, he had another idea.\n\nâ€œ[I]f gentle Donald is frightened by Mark and Sean and Rush, then weâ€™ll have no moderator whatsoever. A town hall of Iowans, and Iâ€™ll tell you what, Donald, you can invite half the people and control half the tickets. Weâ€™ll invite half the people and half the tickets, and each of us will alternate asking questions from the men and women of Iowa who are going to vote in the caucus on Monday night,â€? Cruz offered.\n\nCruz admitted that he doesnâ€™t really expect Trump to accept the challenge.\n\n\n\n\n \nâ€œBecause at the end of the day, itâ€™s not really that Donald is afraid of Megyn. Itâ€™s not that heâ€™s afraid of Mark or Sean or Rush. Itâ€™s not that heâ€™s afraid of me,â€? Cruz explained, wrapping up his case against the billionaire. â€œHeâ€™s afraid of you. He doesnâ€™t want to answer questions from the men and women of Iowa about how his record doesnâ€™t match what heâ€™s selling.â€?\n\nThe original offer, made by Super PACs supporting Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz, told reporters they will donate $1.5 million to charities committed to helping veterans if rival Trump agrees to a one-on-one debate with Cruz.\n\nâ€œNot only would this be a heck of a debate, but it would also be a terrific opportunity to generate millions of dollars for the veterans,â€? the Keep the Promise I and II PACs said in a joint statement Wednesday night.\n\nSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she hopes Trump will accept the offer by Cruz for a one-on-one debate.\n\nâ€œIt boils down to the fact that Cruz and Trump are both just pure evil. If Cruzâ€™s Super Pac donates the money with no story, they donâ€™t get their â€œheadlinesâ€?. If they do something like this, to get the story, it gives Ted Cruz an opportunity to look like a hero in the eyes of his fans if Trump backs down. And if Trump agrees, it will be a fun circus attraction to watch. But most importantly, veterans will get $1.5 million and Ted Cruz will have to wear makeup,â€? Bradley said. â€œEven though Ted Cruz is evil incarnate, this is the only thing his campaign has ever done that I actually support.â€?\n\nMegyn Kelly of Fox News, a moderator at Iowaâ€™s debates on Thursday said she hopes Trump will accept the offer made by Cruz.\n\nâ€œWill Donald Trump man up and do this or will he chicken out? I for one would love to see veterans get $1.5 million, and maybe even more so, see what Cruz looks like with eye liner.â€?',fake
'Donald Trump Announces Sheriff Joe Arpaio As His Vice Presidential Running Mate\nJimmy Rustling, ABC News \nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/donald-trump-announces-joe-arpaio-as-his-vice-president/\nYesterday, Sheriff Joe Arpaio officially endorsed Donald Trump for president. Today, Trump shocked the country by announcing Arpaio as his pick for Vice Presidential running mate in 2016.\n\nâ€œI have great respect for Joe Arpaio,â€? Trump told reporters. â€œLike me, he understands that we must restore law and order to the border and respect the men and women of our police forces. I thank him for his support of my policies and candidacy for President. He too knows that we can make America great again, and because of this, I am proud to announce Joe Arpaio as my Vice Presidential running mate. And just moments ago, Iâ€™m happy to report that Arpaio has accepted my offer. So itâ€™s now official; you will see a Trump-Arpaio ticket come this November.â€?\n\nâ€œDonald Trump is a leader,â€? Arpaio said in a written statement distributed by Trumpâ€™s presidential campaign. â€œHe produces results and is ready to get tough in order to protect American jobs and families. I have fought on the front lines to prevent illegal immigration. I know Donald Trump will stand with me and countless Americans to secure our border. I am proud to support him as the best candidate for President and even prouder to accept his challenge of being the next Vice President of the United States.â€?\n\n\n\n\n \nPaul Horner, a spokesman for Trumpâ€™s campaign told ABC News that a press conference is set for sometime tomorrow to officially announce the news of Trumpâ€™s pick of Arpaio for his Vice President.\n\nMost of Trumpâ€™s supporters are ecstatic to hear about the news of Arpaio being the Vice Presidential running mate for Trump in 2016, but it comes with a cost. Arpaio, an extremely controversial figure, has been accused of abuse of power, misuse of funds, failure to investigate sex crimes, improper clearance of cases, unlawful enforcement of immigration laws, and election law violations, amongst others. He has been found guilty of racial profiling in federal court, with a monitor appointed to oversee the MCSOâ€˜s operations. His jails have twice been ruled unconstitutional. The U.S. Department of Justice concluded that Arpaio oversaw the worst pattern of racial profiling in U.S. history, and subsequently filed a lawsuit against Arpaio for unlawful discriminatory police conduct. Arizona taxpayers have shelled out $8.2 million for outside attorneys in the nearly 4-year-old case, representing a sizable portion of the $50 million that Maricopa County is projected to pay in the lawsuit by next summer. The county has also had to pay out $74 million related to Arpaio that is separate from the racial-profiling costs. That figure includes judgments, settlements and legal fees involving Arpaioâ€™s office during his tenure, covering such things as lawsuits over jail deaths and the Sheriffâ€™s failed investigations of political enemies.\n\nThe official Maricopa County Sheriffâ€™s Office website features a bio of Arpaio that touts his â€˜Tent City Accomplishmentsâ€™ by providing inmates with â€œthe cheapest meals in the U.S.â€? by feeding inmates â€œonly twice daily, to cut the labor costs of meal delivery.â€?\n\nSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, told ABC News that she does not approve of Trumpâ€™s pick for Vice President.\n\n\n\n\n \nâ€œA Donald Trump-Joe Arpaio ticket is like if Hitler came back to life, merged bodies with Satan and then chose evil incarnate as his Vice Presidential running mate,â€? Bradley said. â€œAs someone who lives in Phoenix, and deals with the homeless problem there on a daily basis, I can say without a doubt; everyone would be much better without Sheriff Joe Arpaio.â€? Bradley continued, â€œThe criminal justice system in Maricopa County is a joke; itâ€™s a never-ending revolving door. They want you locked up in Arizona. They want you violating your probation, not being able to pay your child support, charging you with as many felonies as possible. All of this, so when you go out and try and get a job, no one will hire you because this Right to Work state is stricter on felons than any other state by far. So for someone with a criminal record, itâ€™s either a job in telemarketing or going back to crime. And with a felony in this state, youâ€™re denied pretty much every type of assistance; and that includes money, food stamps and getting a bed in most homeless shelters. So you have no job, no food and now youâ€™re homeless too. And the Phoenix Police go out of their way to harass the homeless population here, itâ€™s absolutely sickening how they treat them like animals. Even when weâ€™re handing out socks we get bothered by the police all the time. They act like theyâ€™re doing us a favor by allowing us the privilege to give out new socks to people who are forced to sleep outside because some shelter wonâ€™t take them in because of their past criminal record. So with more and more homeless people in Arizona everyday, more and more crime, police budgets going up, taxes going up, the people here start accepting a police state and Joe Arpaio keeps getting reelected every year.â€?\n\nArpaio historically has been courted by Republican presidential candidates for endorsements, but never a Vice Presidential nomination. In the 2008 primaries, Arpaio backed former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney over a fellow Arizonan, Sen. John McCain. McCain won the GOP nomination that year. In the 2012 race, Arpaio threw his support to then-Texas Gov. Rick Perry, whose candidacy was also unsuccessful.',fake

'Bill Murray Saves Life Of Phoenix Man By Performing Heimlich Maneuver\nJimmy Rustling, ABC News\nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/bill-murray-saves-life-of-choking-man/\nPhoenix, AZ â€” In a scene straight from the movie Groundhog Day, Bill Murray saved the life of a man who was choking while dining at a popular steakhouse in Phoenix, Arizona today.\n\nMurray was enjoying a meal at Meritage Steakhouse with friends when a man three tables from him began to choke on his food.\n\nâ€œI saw this guy choking, so I went over and helped him out,â€? Murray said. â€œI actually learned the Heimlich maneuver while working on the movie Groundhog Day. Iâ€™m glad I was able to get some good use of that skill outside of the movies.â€? Murray continued, â€œIâ€™m no hero. I just did what anyone else would have done in a situation like that.â€?37-year-old, Paul Horner, told ABC News how Murray saved his life.\n\nâ€œI guess I just took too much of a bite of streak because suddenly I couldnâ€™t breathe and started choking. My wife says I started to turn blue, and the next thing I know, none other than Bill Murray is giving me the Heimlich maneuver,â€? Horner says. â€œIt was an amazing experience and he is such a good person. I offered to pay his tab and the party he was with, but he wouldnâ€™t let me. He did say I could buy him a drink though, so thatâ€™s what I did. He then ate one of my french fries and told me that no one will ever believe me. It was so surreal.â€?\n\nTom Downey, who witnessed the incident, told local news station ABC 15 about the dayâ€™s excitement.\n\nâ€œThis man started choking, so without hesitation, Bill Murray got up from his table, ran over to this gentleman and immediately started giving him the Heimlich. While everyone else in the restaurant was wondering what to do, Murray stepped up and saved the day. What a cool guy.â€?\n\nMurray told ABC News he will be in the Valley this week staying with friends and enjoying the sites.\n\nâ€œThis week I plan on going to a couple things with friends and tonight will probably end up at the Tempe Improv. Thereâ€™s a couple comics playing there that Iâ€™ve been wanting to see for a while now. I might tell some jokes if I feel like it, weâ€™ll see. I really like bartending. Maybe theyâ€™ll let me do that. Regardless, it should be a fun time for everyone.â€?\n\nParamedics said the man who Murray saved is doing fine and walked away from the scene on his own accord.',fake

The fact that this freak was investigated twice by the FBI in the last two years but was still able to buy an AR-15 is beyond ridiculous.\n\nOmar Mateen used a legally purchased assault rifle and handgun, which he had bought in the last 12 days, to kill 50 innocent lives and injure 53 more.

'President Obama Signs Executive Order Banning The Sale Of Assault Weapons\nJimmy Rustling, ABC News \nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/obama-signs-executive-order-banning-sale-of-assault-weapons/\nPresident Obama signing Executive Order 17103 which bans the sale of assault weapons and places a mandatory 30 day waiting period on all firearm sales. (AP Photo/ Dennis System)\nPresident Obama promises large scale Homeland Security raids if gun violence does not subside\nExecutive Order includes mandatory 30 day waiting period on all new firearm sales\nFelony prison time for those who do not comply with the new law\nWASHINGTON D.C. (AP) â€” After last Sundayâ€™s mass shooting in Orlando, which left 50 Americans dead and 53 wounded, President Obama decided to take unilateral action on gun control by signing Executive Order 17103. The new law bans all sales of assault weapons and places a mandatory 30 day waiting period on all firearm sales, regardless of whether the transaction takes place at a gun dealership or gun show. The requirement also extends to private sales and requires all private firearm sellers to broker the sale through a federally licensed gun dealer. The order requires prospective gun buyers to undergo a psychological evaluation. Individuals who have been committed involuntarily to a mental health institution at any time; those who have been voluntarily committed with the past 5 years; anyone with a domestic violence restraining order, regardless of criminal history; and anyone who has been placed on the no-fly list or terrorist watch list at any time within the past 10 years will not be allowed to purchase or possess firearms.\n\nPresident Obama was unapologetic in his speech regarding the Executive Order.\n\nâ€œIf we are to truly change things for the better, we must come to grips with the ugly truth that our culture is obsessed with violence in all forms. We must work to quell the rising tide of anti-intellectualism and recommit to educating people of all ages so that they are capable of expressing their thoughts and feelings like civilized adults and not like hapless barbarians. Reforming our gun laws is not a magic bullet, and yes, people will find other ways to kill each other, but by making these killing machines harder to get we can hopefully, at the very least, make it so that not as many people fall victim to these random, senseless acts of deplorable violence. I donâ€™t want to take your guns away. I just want to make it harder for the Omar Mateens of the world to kill innocent people. I think we can all agree that if youâ€™re deemed too much of a national security threat to fly on an airplane, you shouldnâ€™t be able to buy an AR-15. Unfortunately, the Republicans didnâ€™t feel this way, and theyâ€™ve left me with no other choice. If things donâ€™t change, and people keep dying as a result of senseless acts of gun violence,  Iâ€™ll have no choice but to order Homeland Security to hunt down every last assault rifle in this country.â€?\n\nSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, told ABC News that she agrees with the new gun law.\n\n\n\n\n \nâ€œThese are common sense gun laws and Republicans are using the Second Amendment as a shield that continues to let innocent people die,â€? Bradley said. â€œObama is not tryinâ€™ to take errr guns, heâ€™s doing something that shouldâ€™ve been done a long time ago. If this law would have been in place before, this Orlando shooting would have never happened. This horrible tragedy was about lack of gun control and had nothing to do with terrorism. Omar Mateen had no communication with ISIS and knew very little about them. As more news comes out about the shooter, we are learning he was a closeted homosexual, and because of his religion, he knew this was not allowed. He hated the fact that he was gay and instead of dealing with it like a man, by getting counseling or leaving Islam, he took his problems out violently on others.â€? Bradley continued, â€œI also just want to quickly say â€˜thank youâ€™ to everyone that has donated to our cause! The smiles you are putting on homeless peoplesâ€™ faces is indescribably. A lot of people donâ€™t know this fact, but socks are the least donated item at shelters but most desired. Please keep the donations coming regardless if it is $5 or $500, every bit helps so much!â€?\n\nA group of Donald Trump supporters, known as Bullets First, is planning to protest the signing of the Executive Order by marching on Capitol Hill, and in front of the White House, armed with the controversial AR-15, as well as other military style weapons. The group says that it is prepared to â€œdefend the constitution at all costs.â€? The group is calling for Obama to resign and allow the organization to place him under citizenâ€™s arrest for treason. The groupâ€™s leader, 52-year-old Tom Downey, who has two children and another on the way, quit his job as an overnight cashier at the TA truck stop in Sayre, Oklahoma to organize the rally. Downey claims that he has over 100,000 Trump supporters from all over America ready to head to D.C. and â€œtake back the country.â€? His common law wife, 23-year-old Tami Hobart, supports his decision wholeheartedly, and while she worries about him getting killed, says that at least she can tell her children that he died standing up for their right to stockpile military grade weapons without â€œgetting hassled by an out of control Islamo-communist fascist dictatorship.â€?\n\nThe group has the backing of right wing shock jock Alex Jones who called on his listeners to â€œbring about the final solution to the Obama questionâ€? on his radio show this morning and pledged financial and logistical support to the Bullets First protestors. Given this development, it is very likely that the group will not be able to be contained by the Washington D.C. police department alone. ABC News says the Pentagon has confirmed that the government is preparing for a â€œpossible military confrontationâ€?, though they stressed that this was a â€œworst case scenarioâ€?.\n\nDespite the heated emotions over this Executive Order, it is not likely to impact the lives of current gun owners in any meaningful way. Elroy Stevens, an avid deer hunter who spends his weekends out in the woods hunting with friends or shooting clay pigeons at his Father-in-lawâ€™s ranch in West Texas told ABC News he is not worried about the new gun law.\n\nâ€œIt wonâ€™t stop someone from being able to buy a handgun for self-defense,â€? Stevens said. â€œIt does nothing to address individual statesâ€™ concealed and open carry laws, nor does it limit the number of firearms an individual may own. It does not require the surrender of existing assault weapons, though it does ban all future transfers. This new law makes a minimal effort to keep guns out of the wrong hands.â€?\n\nAs Obama addressed the crowd, the President told reporters that the country needs more than just common sense gun laws.\n\nâ€œThese new gun laws alone will not fix this problem. There are already numerous guns in circulation, and, moreover, the real issue isnâ€™t a gun issue; it is a culture issue. Americans crave television programs that romanticize and fetishize violence. Ignorance is celebrated, while intellectualism is mocked relentlessly. For many gun owners, guns are a tool that must respected and handled with care; for many others, guns are nothing more than an expensive toy. Folks, when this utter disregard for the destructive power of guns is mixed with easy access and a culture that devalues human life, it is a recipe not only for disaster, but for absolute ruin.â€?\n\nDavid Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate information they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.\n\n\n\n\n \nâ€œYou have to understand that when a story like this goes viral, and we spend a minute or two debunking it, we make lots of money. Stories like this have helped put my children through college, buy a new car, a home and even get the gender reassignment surgery my wife Barbara has always wanted since she was a little boy,â€? Mikkleson said. â€œWe claim â€˜to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as wellâ€˜, but thatâ€™s just ridiculous. Do you know how much time that would take? Instead, we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours, write a couple sentences, and thatâ€™s it. I just want to be clear, our website does zero journalism or anything creative, and Iâ€™m only telling you this for legal reasons. For example, do you remember that recent article we wrote debunking a story which claimed Scientology lost its tax-exempt status? Did you actually read our story? Who is the name of the person responsible for the hoax? What is the actual website URL? We claim to know it, but no real information is posted by us.â€? Mikkelson continues, â€œIt is common for us to rewrite a story weâ€™re debunking if we donâ€™t like it. In one recent story of ours, we actually removed a personâ€™s name from the original article and then called him a liar, oh the hypocrisy, but it is so funny at the same time! We also like to post fake, un-funny, juvenile disclaimers supposedly from the site in question and it is our authors, such as Jeff Zarronandia who are responsible for those gems. We tell our readers that the disclaimer is from the story we are debunking, but a simple google search that locates the actual article will show that our disclaimer is 100\% fabricated. Sometimes I think that someone should start a company that debunks our debunkings, they could probably make a lot of money,â€? Mikkelson laughs. â€œAnd lots of people complain about our authors attacking websites and their owners for reasons that are 100\% proven false, but since we block archive.org it just becomes their word versus ours. Plus, I know for our writers like Kim LaCapria, it is way more fun for them to cause controversy than report the facts; it results in more visitors. Kim LaCapria and Jeff Zarronandia go as far as accusing the site that the story originated from as â€˜a clickbait fake news site that infringes the trademark-protected visual elements and domain names of legitimate news outlets in order to generate traffic and drive advertising revenues by creating and spreading entirely false â€œnewsâ€? storiesâ€˜. The thing that is troubling about these claims and what Snopes and our authors are known for. We donâ€™t list ONE factual piece of evidence to back up any of our claims; Itâ€™s just more of our hack, unethical journalism, and I only tell you this for legal reasons. I think it is business as usual for us to accuse the story we are debunking of spreading malware and viruses, but we never say what website it actually is. I think warning people about a site that could potentially destroy their computer is probably a good idea, and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism, but people will click our ads regardless, bottom line; so why do the extra work? To be honest, Iâ€™d say in a given week I probably only do about fifteen minutes of real, actual, work.â€?\n\nWashington political analyst, 37-year-old Paul Horner, who has been in the hospital since early last month after getting into an accident while in Puerto PeÃ±asco, Mexico, told ABC News what led up to this assault gun ban on both sides of the party.\n\nâ€œRepublicans are saying the Orlando shooting is about terrorism because the shooter said he did it for ISIS, even though ISIS did not instruct him to do it and never once had any communication with him. Democrats believe that if we had common sense gun laws in place this tragedy would never occurred. They believe that people like Omar Mateen, who was on a terror watch list and had been interviewed by the FBI three times, should not be allowed to buy assault weapons. And with all of this going on, Iâ€™m just laid up in a hospital bed not able to masturbate.â€?\n\nFappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, a mascot for a Christian organization that travels around the country educating children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, told reporters he does not agree with Mr. Hornerâ€™s comments about touching himself in a hospital bed.\n\nâ€œI think it is great that Paul Horner is not able to pleasure himself right now. He should be focusing on healing and not playing with his sin stick. I have activated my prayer app and I encourage everyone to prayer for Mr. Horner during these difficult times; Not a full-prayer though, just a half prayer.â€?\n\nExecutive Order 17103 goes into effect July 1st, 2016. The Obama Administration has setup a hotline for individuals to report those who are not abiding by the new law. To encourage the publicâ€™s help in cracking down on those who are not following the law, a $500 reward is being offered. The administration urges you to call (785) 273-0325 with any information that you may have, and as always, you can remain anonymous.',fake
'Changing the Way the World Connects\nJimmy Rustling, ABC News \nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/changing-way-world-connects/\nThe internet is something of an unusual phenomenon. Throughout human history, advancements were made at quite a steady pace. The agricultural revolution, which saw human beings go from nomadic tribes to stationary creatures capable of farming, took thousands of years. The industrial revolution, which transformed the landscape of how people traveled and created goods, lasted a handful of decades and the changes took place over this entire timeline. Now, in the age of the internet, the world seems to change at a rapid, almost erratic, pace with no signs of stopping.\n\nDue to the advent of the internet, the world has become quite small. It is easy to connect to someone on the other side of the planet in mere seconds. Still, all internet is not treated equally around the world and many are working to make a change in the way that specific countries are connecting.\n\nA Fall and a Rise\nAfghan American entrepreneur Ehsan Bayat is a figure that took a look at the landscape of the world and decided to change it for the better. After the fall of the Taliban in his home country, he realized that there was a vacuum in connectivity. While other nations used the internet freely, most citizens of Afghanistan were still relying on home telephones to communicate with one another, and there were not even enough phone lines in the nation to support the entirety of the population.\n\nDeciding that someone had to do something about this disparity, Bayat set out to create Telephone Systems International. Not only is TSI the largest mobile phone company to be found in his homeland, it also has the honor of being the first of its kind in Afghanistan. This move allowed people in Afghanistan to connect in a way that they never had before, opening new doors of thought and awareness on the world as a whole. Bayatâ€™s work also earned him many humanitarian awards and honors from the global community.\n\nLimited Exposure\nFor a large portion of the world, connecting to the internet is simple. Most people own a smartphone, and can access any information that they need with the quick tap of a screen. Still, there is a significant number of countries where smartphones are rare. In a country such as Lebanon, for example, it is not uncommon for a specific part of the population to rely on the internet via their smartphones. Though there are not many, there still are a significant number when compared to other nations.\n\nOn the other hand, countries like Tunisia or the Philippines have statistics that state that citizens are less likely to have smartphones but still rely on their cellphones throughout the day. Though the people of these nations might not be refreshing their Facebook all day long or stalking their friendsâ€™ lunches on Instagram, they still utilize their phones each day for texting and sending pictures. While financial imbalances in these countries might be a large reason for a lack of advanced technology, the desire and the need for internet access are consistently present.\n\nSatellite Transmissions\nWhile it might seem impossible to boost all of these nations into the modern era, there is a lot of work being done to help where it is possible. World Vision International, for example, is a charity that provides humanitarian support to those in need. Often, the workers from this group who enter nations without proper internet access have a difficult time connecting with others back home. This, in turn, makes it difficult for the organization to know exactly what is going on with their volunteers and employees at all times.\n\nTo rectify this, World Vision International has begun putting a plan into action that might be able to help the situation. Utilizing satellite technology, the group has found a way to keep in touch with humanitarians where there is no easy access to data transmission. Essentially, transmitters are placed in a spot where the individual will be working, which communicate with a specific satellite in orbit, in order to send and receive information. This technology helps immensely, as it allows the organization to stay connected to workers in the field, and it opens up the doors for untold possibilities in the future.\n\nMaking Moves\nOther groups are trying to improve access to the internet across the world in many different ways. A Human Right is an organization dedicated to making the world a more connected place. Their mission is simple: every human has the right to access the internet. The group is more than a clever mantra, and they have tirelessly worked to make changes happen in recent years.\n\nFor many years, there has been a plan in the works to lay down a fiber optic cable that linked South Africa to Brazil. Referred to as the South Atlantic Express, this cable caught the attention of A Human Right. The organization noticed that the cable was bypassing the island of Saint Helena, denying convenient internet access to thousands. After much petitioning, the group was able to have the cable rerouted, creating a planned landing station on the small island. Now, when the cable begins connecting people in 2017, Saint Helena will be among the many who have easy internet access.\n\nThere are plenty of ways that people and organizations are trying to connect the world. From Ehsan Bayat to A Human Right, these pioneers are responsible for transforming the landscape and making the world a more equal place for all.',fake

Murray said. â€œI donâ€™t like most of the candidates that are currently running for President. I mean, Bernie Sanders seems like a decent guy, but the rest of emâ€™, are pretty much complete scum in my opinion.â€? Murray continued, â€œIâ€™m always traveling around the world, but Iâ€™m proud to call America, the good oleâ€™ U.S. of A, my home. I think thereâ€™s a lot of great people here, a lot of potential, but thereâ€™s also a lot of confusion and hate. People donâ€™t know what to make of these Hitler wanna-beâ€™s like Donald Trump, and the Ted Cruzâ€™s, who want to start World War III. They feed on the hate and paranoia a lot of this country has, and because of that, you see them leading in the polls. And itâ€™s sad that people go along with it, and canâ€™t see it for what it really is. I think the American people are better than that and they deserve better.

But it would keep me up, thatâ€™s for sure. Look, Iâ€™m no hero, I just want to help out, and I think I can do that by being President.â€? Murray finished by saying, â€œSo Iâ€™m making it official, right here, right now; I Bill Murray am running for President of the United States in 2016.â€?\n\n\n\n\n \nWhen reporters asked Murray his plans on improving America, Murray said, â€œI think we ought to be personally responsible. I think if you can take care of yourself and then maybe take care of someone else then thatâ€™s sort of how youâ€™re supposed to live. I think weâ€™ve sort of gotten used to someone looking out for us, and I donâ€™t think any other person is necessarily going to be counted on to look out for us.â€?\n\nSo far it is unclear what political party Murray will be joining.\n\nIn 2012, Murray met Obama purely by chance at a basketball game â€“ Murray never endorsed him. In fact, when asked about the Obama/Romney race happening that year, Murray said there really was not much difference between them.\n\nâ€œYou know they both talk, theyâ€™re not so different really, you know if you shake them out, theyâ€™re not so different as people in what they say they believe itâ€™s just whether or not they can get it done, and that requires finding that stuff, that real stuff, finding that presence of mind and spirit.â€?\n\nWhen asked about his religious views, Murray told reporters, â€œReligion is the worst enemy of mankind. People can believe whatever they choose to believe, but it does not belong in politics. It imprisons your mind. Religion creates hate, racism, bigotry and keeps you from your true potential in life. No single war in the history of humanity has killed as many people as religion has. I imagine I probably wonâ€™t be too popular with the Christian vote in this country, but Iâ€™m fine with that,â€? Murray laughs.\n\nSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she fully supports Murray and his run for President.\n\nâ€œWe need a new face in Washington. Someone who has no political ties or agenda and canâ€™t be bought,â€? Bradley said. â€œI actually met Bill Murray a while back when we were starting our cause that gives new socks to the homeless. Bill made a donation right there on the spot, saying what we were doing was amazing; heâ€™s such a great guy. He truly cares about people and making the world a better place.â€?\n\nPaul Horner, a spokesman for the campaign, told reporters that he believes in Bill Murray for President in 2016.\n\nâ€œWe need a man like Bill Murray now more than ever. He is a man of the people. Heâ€™s charming, charismatic, intelligent, humble, caring and most of all, heâ€™s honest. He has no scandals. Heâ€™s told no lies. The people love him and respect him, they believe in him. Heâ€™s a living legend and is exactly what America needs right now.â€?\n\nMurrayâ€™s campaign team told reporters they will begin campaigning at the Arizona State Capitol on Wednesday, The Lost Leaf at 10PM on Thursday for their monthly Mystery Show to talk to the locals and maybe tell some jokes, and then all throughout Denver, Colorado on Friday.\n',fake
'It’s been a whirlwind few days of bombshells and videos that have to be seen to be believed.  The level of corruption and collusion exposed by both the Wikileaks releases of John Podesta’s emails, and the Project Vertias undercover videos of Democratic operatives charged with carrying out voter fraud and election rigging is astounding.  Word now comes that one of the people caught on tape, Robert Creamer, founder of Democracy Partners, one of the entities inciting violence, voter fraud, and more, visited the White House 340 times in the Obama years, with 45 meetings where Barack Obama was present.At the time of this writing, Creamer has decided to “step back” from participating in Democracy Partners activities.  Current Democratic National Committee Chairperson Donna Brazile claims that Creamer and his people were but bit players in the campaign process.  Creamer’s own words, and James O’Keefe’s investigative reporting with Project Veritas refutes that.In one hidden camera video, filmed at Creamer’s Washington, D.C. office, Creamer explains that Hillary Clinton is aware of “all” of his activities, directly or indirectly, and that Democracy Partners has a daily conference call with the Clinton campaign, as well as frequent calls with the White House.According to the White House visitor logs, Creamer actually met with Barack Obama privately twice, in 2011 and 2013.  What was discussed in those sessions is anyone’s guess.Creamer is the second of the Democratic operatives to be removed from campaign activities since the Project Veritas videos were released.  The first was Scott Foval.  He was fired from Americans United for Change on Tuesday after his appearance in the video, and his stated admiration for Creamer, and his diabolical ideas.  Foval described the efforts as being “black hat.”Statements published by Democracy Partners and the DNC discuss well-funded smear campaigns similar to the Watergate effort that eventually brought down the presidency of Richard Nixon who was accused of doing far less than Hillary Clinton is known to have done in the felony department.BREAKING News: Bob Creamer, top @HillaryClinton campaign advisor, \"STEPS DOWN\" after today\'s video.

'Ted Cruz: â€œI Will Endorse Donald Trump For President If He Makes Masturbation Illegalâ€?\nJimmy Rustling, ABC News \nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/ted-cruz-to-endorse-trump-for-president-masturbation-illegal/\nWASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) â€” U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) sent shockwaves through the Republican Party today when he announced that he would endorse Donald Trump for President, but only if the GOP nominee would be willing to publicly support a ban on masturbation. The Senator called this â€˜The single most important issue facing the country todayâ€™ and that without â€˜swift action by the next President the country was doomed to slide down a slippery slope of debauchery and self-satisfactionâ€™.\n\n\n\n\n \nâ€œSelf-love is a silent killer in this country. This needless act of hedonistic indulgence is leading our children down a dark and destructive path. It starts innocently enough with a JC Penney catalogue tucked under your mattress, but it quickly spirals out of control, and before you know it, your mother has to call the coroner because youâ€™ve died from auto-erotic asphyxiation. Iâ€™m not saying that we should lock up these one armed bandits and throw away the key; what we need is a compassionate approach that helps these deviants reform and become productive members of society. That is why I believe a prison sentence of three to five years will help motivate these heathens to change their evil ways and stay off the Devilâ€™s playground for good,â€? Cruz said. â€œIâ€™m asking Mr. Trump to acknowledge the severity of this problem, and commit to finding real solutions. If he does that, I will do whatever it takes to help him secure the White House in November. Should Mr. Trump decline, I think itâ€™s safe to say that all options, including a third party run, are out on the table.â€?\n\nDonald Trump told ABC News that he was open to the idea, though he refused to take a clear stand on the issue.\n\nâ€œLook, do I think Ted Cruz is right about this? Maybe he is, maybe he isnâ€™t. To be honest, I donâ€™t know a lot about this subject matter. I donâ€™t need to. I have a wife that takes care of this for me, and sheâ€™s a beautiful wife, the best wife, the greatest wife. My people are going to take a hard look into this matter and find a great answer for it, the best answer there is. I want an endorsement from Senator Cruz, and I think I can go along with his request that makes pleasuring your genitalia for non-reproductive purposes illegal.â€?\n\nThis is not the first time that Cruz has attempted to use his political power to curtail the act of self-stimulation. As solicitor general of Texas in 2007 he fought to uphold the stateâ€™s ban on sex toys by arguing that there was no â€œRight to stimulate oneâ€™s genitals.â€? Cruz eventually lost this battle, but the story re-surfaced this year and gained widespread media attention, prompting Cruzâ€™s former college roommate Craig Mazin to tweet that Cruzâ€™s stance against stimulating oneâ€™s own genitals was â€œA new belief of hisâ€?, implying that much of Cruzâ€™s time in college was, in fact, spent stimulating his own genitals. Another one of Cruzâ€™s former college roommates, Matt Daemon, has recently come forward to corroborate Mazinâ€™s story.\n\nâ€œAll Ted Cruz did was take care of little Ted Cruz back then, which is fine I guess, but he was always real creepy about doing it. Honestly, I lost track of the number of times I came home to find him laying on the couch naked, lotion and Kleenex next to him, watching re-runs of Walker Texas Ranger. He wouldnâ€™t even try and cover up when I caught him, he would just stare at me in the eyes and continue until I left the room. Itâ€™s absolutely hilarious about the tough stance on touching oneâ€™s self that Ted has taken in this country. I truly believe he may have pulled on it one too many times and it broke or something and now feels that if he canâ€™t do it anymore, then no one can.â€?\n\n\n\n\n \nSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, told ABC News that she is sickened by the Republican party.\n\nâ€œIt is absolutely disgusting that in this day in age, a creepy weirdo like Ted Cruz was almost elected as the GOP nomination for President,â€? Bradley said. â€œWith all the real problems in this country like starvation, so many people out of work and families living on the street, Cruz is focused on making pleasuring yourself a crime.â€? Bradley continued, â€œAlso, I just want to say a big thank you to everyone that has supported our cause in giving new socks to the homeless, it means so much. Please, donate what you can, every bit helps.â€?\n\nCruz, however, remains undeterred by his detractors. â€œWhen you play with your Devil stick or ring the Devilâ€™s doorbell you make the angels in heaven weep, and they are weeping for this country 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. America needs strong moral leadership, and I pray that Donald Trump is up to the task. The fate of our great nation is in his hands; hopefully, theyâ€™re big enough to handle it.â€?\n\nMost pundits expect Trump to answer Cruzâ€™s call and demand a stiffer approach to the matter. A recent poll by the New York Times found that 43\% of likely Trump voters support a ban on self-stimulation due to moral and religious concerns. Another 46\% would be okay with a ban, saying that they, like Trump, have far too many potential suitors, and therefore do not need to satisfy their own urges. Only 11\% of Trump supporters are against a ban.\n\nRNC political strategist, 37-year-old Paul Horner, calls the move a â€œno-brainerâ€? and says that Trump would be foolish to turn his back on Cruz.\n\nâ€œConservatives are siding with Cruz overwhelmingly on this issue. If Donald does not side with the Senator, he risks alienating the partyâ€™s Christian base and opening the door for a third party run by Cruz which would fracture the vote and all but guarantee a victory for Clinton. Trump needs to agree with Cruz on this one, no matter how creepy, insane and absolutely horrible of a person he is.â€?\n\nDavid Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate information they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.\n\nâ€œYou have to understand that when a story like this goes viral, and we spend a minute or two debunking it, we make lots of money. Stories like this have helped put my children through college, buy a new car, a home and even get the gender reassignment surgery my wife Barbara has always wanted since she was a little boy,â€? Mikkleson said. â€œWe claim â€˜to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as wellâ€˜, but thatâ€™s just ridiculous. Do you know how much time that would take? Instead, we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours, write a couple sentences, and thatâ€™s it. I just want to be clear, our website does zero journalism or anything creative, and Iâ€™m only telling you this for legal reasons. For example, do you remember that recent article we wrote debunking a story which claimed Scientology lost its tax-exempt status? Did you actually read our story? Who is the name of the person responsible for the hoax? What is the actual website URL? We claim to know it, but no real information is posted by us.â€? Mikkelson continues, â€œIt is common for us to rewrite a story weâ€™re debunking if we donâ€™t like it. In one recent story of ours, we actually removed a personâ€™s name from the original article and then called him a liar, oh the hypocrisy, but it is so funny at the same time! We also like to post fake, un-funny, juvenile disclaimers supposedly from the site in question and it is our authors, such as Jeff Zarronandia who are responsible for those gems. We tell our readers that the disclaimer is from the story we are debunking, but a simple google search that locates the actual article will show that our disclaimer is 100\% fabricated. Sometimes I think that someone should start a company that debunks our debunkings, they could probably make a lot of money,â€? Mikkelson laughs. â€œAnd lots of people complain about our authors attacking websites and their owners for reasons that are 100\% proven false, but since we block archive.org it just becomes their word versus ours. Plus, I know for our writers like Kim LaCapria, it is way more fun for them to cause controversy than report the facts; it results in more visitors. Kim LaCapria and Jeff Zarronandia go as far as accusing the site that the story originated from as â€˜a clickbait fake news site that infringes the trademark-protected visual elements and domain names of legitimate news outlets in order to generate traffic and drive advertising revenues by creating and spreading entirely false â€œnewsâ€? storiesâ€˜. The thing that is troubling about these claims and what Snopes and our authors are known for. We donâ€™t list ONE factual piece of evidence to back up any of our claims; Itâ€™s just more of our hack, unethical journalism, and I only tell you this for legal reasons. I think it is business as usual for us to accuse the story we are debunking of spreading malware and viruses, but we never say what website it actually is. I think warning people about a site that could potentially destroy their computer is probably a good idea, and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism, but people will click our ads regardless, bottom line; so why do the extra work? To be honest, Iâ€™d say in a given week I probably only do about fifteen minutes of real, actual, work.â€?\n\nRegardless of which side Trump takes on the issue, it is certain to invoke heated debate on both sides of the political aisle.

'Facebook Buys Snapchat For Five Billion Dollars\nJimmy Rustling, ABC News\nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/facebook-buys-snapchat-five-billion-dollars/\nMENLO PARK, C.A. (AP) â€” Facebook announced this morning that it has purchased mobile photo sharing app Snapchat for the price of five billion dollars. The social media titan had previously tried to purchase Snapchat for three billion in 2013, but Snapchatâ€™s CEO Evan Spiegel rejected the offer, citing his desire to continue growing the company instead of settling for a short term gain.\n\nâ€œThis is a bittersweet moment for us here,â€? Spiegel said in a press conference. â€œItâ€™s sad to let go of something that weâ€™ve put so much time and hard work in, but  weâ€™ve already accomplished so much more than we ever dreamed possible. I feel much better about this than I did in 2013.â€?\n\nIn an official statement, Facebook said that it intends to phase out the Snapchat app and assimilate the technology into its existing Instagram platform.\n\n\n\n\n \nâ€œFor the first year, the two apps will exist side by side with Instagram slowly adding more of Snapchatâ€™s features,â€? said Facebook spokesman Arthur Mitchum, â€œBut eventually Snapchat will cease to exist altogether. Once Snapchatâ€™s technology has been fully integrated into Instagram, it will be pointless for us to continue maintaining two separate platforms.â€?\n\nIn order to sell users on the change, Facebook is planning a multi-million dollar ad campaign featuring Big Bang Theory actress Kelly Cuoco and Hunger Games star Jennifer Lawrence. Facebook also indicated that the campaign will feature a male celebrity, whom they have yet to name. According to TMZ, the frontrunners are pop star Justin Bieber and Adam Levine from Maroon 5 and NBCâ€™s â€œThe Voiceâ€?.\n\nFacebook buys Snapchat\nReaction to the deal has been mixed thus far, with many excited to see how Facebook will integrate Snapchat with its Instagram app. Others are angry that Facebook plans to shutter Snapchat in favor of Instagram. Twitter user @salteepeanuts tweeted that â€œMark Zuckerburg wonâ€™t stop until heâ€™s ruined everything good about the internet.â€?\n\nDr. Cassandra Schmidt of the Center for Integrity in Media has serious concerns about the implications of the deal.\n\nâ€œItâ€™s always troubling when you see this kind of media consolidation,â€? Dr. Schmidt told ABC news. â€œWe currently have a situation where 6 companies control 90\% of traditional media sources. The internet was supposed to change this and give more power to the little guy, but we are still seeing the same tendency toward consolidation. Those Snapchat users who donâ€™t like Facebook will be left with few, if any, alternatives.â€?\n\nThe deal has already generated a tremendous amount of buzz on Wall Street. Facebookâ€™s stock is up 20\% this morning, but some investors are taking more of a wait and see approach.\n\nâ€œA deal of this scope is really unprecedented in the social media world,â€? said Lawrence Ketchum, who writes about the tech industry for Forbes. â€œIt could be a real game changer and turn the entire internet on its head; then again, it could be a real dud and turn into a huge liability for Facebook. Investors will be watching this deal very closely to see how it affects the social media landscape.â€?\n\nIf you want to learn more about this deal and what it means for you as a consumer, you can call Facebookâ€™s public relations hotline at (202) 642-5720.',fake

The prison was put on lockdown as personnel went looking for them.\n\n7:15 AM: A prison van was found abandoned only a mile away from the prison. Mexican officials believe the two guards, who began working at the prison just months ago, were actually members of the Sinaloa Cartel working for GuzmÃ¡n.\n\n\n\n\n \nBefore todayâ€™s escape, Mexican officials were working to extradite â€œEl Chapoâ€? to the United States, where he faced drug trafficking charges connected to his cartel, authorities said.\n\nThis is now the third time GuzmÃ¡n has escaped from a Mexican prison and brings into question Mexicoâ€™s ability to keep corruption out of itâ€™s penal system.\n\nIn 1993, GuzmÃ¡n was captured in Guatemala, extradited and sentenced to 20 years in prison in Mexico for murder and drug trafficking. In 2001, after bribing Mexican prison guards, he was able to escape from a federal maximum-security prison in 2001. On February 22nd, 2014, GuzmÃ¡n was found inside his fourth-floor condominium in MazatlÃ¡n, Sinaloa, and was captured without any gunshots being fired. GuzmÃ¡n escaped from prison again on July 11th, 2015 by exiting through a tunnel that led to a nearby construction site. He was recaptured by Mexican marines following a shootout at Guzmanâ€™s hideout in Mexico on January 8th, 2016. During the raid, five gunmen were killed, six others arrested, and one Marine was wounded. The Mexican Navy said that they found two armored cars, eight assault rifles, including two Barrett M82 sniper rifles, two M16 rifles with grenade launchers and a loaded rocket-propelled grenade launcher. A .50-caliber rifle was also found, capable of taking down a helicopter. Most of the weapons seized, including the .50 caliber rifle, were from the Fast and Furious gun-smuggling scandal, a story the U.S. government declared to be over.\n\nSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, told ABC News that she is sickened by the United Stateâ€™s drug policies.\n\nâ€œThe war on drugs is a joke and long-lost battle,â€? Bradley said. â€œThe U.S. creates these cartels by making drugs illegal in the first place. They lock up people in jail for as little as a joint of marijuana. All the incarcerations related to drugs have helped fund a trillion-dollar penal system; from its lawyers, to judges, to the prison staff and the actual prisons themselves. All of it is just pathetic and truly a sad reality.â€? Bradley continued, â€œAlso, I just want to say a big thank you to everyone that has supported our cause in giving new socks to the homeless, it means so much.

Sometimes I think that someone should start a company that debunks our debunkings, they could probably make a lot of money,â€? Mikkelson laughs. â€œAnd lots of people complain about our authors attacking websites and their owners for reasons that are 100\% proven false, but since we block archive.org it just becomes their word versus ours. Plus, I know for our writers like Kim LaCapria, it is way more fun for them to cause controversy than report the facts; it results in more visitors. Kim LaCapria and Jeff Zarronandia go as far as accusing the site that the story originated from as â€˜a clickbait fake news site that infringes the trademark-protected visual elements and domain names of legitimate news outlets in order to generate traffic and drive advertising revenues by creating and spreading entirely false â€œnewsâ€? storiesâ€˜.

I think it is business as usual for us to accuse the story we are debunking of spreading malware and viruses, but we never say what website it actually is. I think warning people about a site that could potentially destroy their computer is probably a good idea, and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism, but people will click our ads regardless, bottom line; so why do the extra work?

'New McDonaldâ€™s In Scottsdale Run Entirely By Robots\nJimmy Rustling, ABC News\nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/new-mcdonalds-in-scottsdale-run-entirely-by-robots/\nScottsdale, AZ â€” After seeing a decline in earnings for the first time in nine years, McDonaldâ€™s has begun to do something no other restaurant of its kind has ever done before; open stores run entirely by robots.\nThe store is set to open May 1st in Scottsdale, Arizona once the state-of-the-art robot remodel is complete. The restaurant will still employ a small team of human employees to insure all of the robots are working correctly, the food and cleaning supplies remain stocked along with removing the money collected by the robots. Visitors to the restaurant will see these new robots working in harmony at a speed of 50 times faster than the average McDonaldâ€™s employee, with no chance of error. The reason for the new robot-run-store in Scottsdale is the success of their Phoenix restaurant that opened back in July that is also run entirely by robots.\n\nâ€œI just love the robots at that McDonaldâ€™s in Phoenix,â€? 38-year-old Brian Mullan said. â€œI tell the robot what I want to eat, I then put money in their little robot hands, and within minutes, a cute little robot is bringing me out my food. Theyâ€™re way better than humans, plus I donâ€™t like people to begin with. They should just burn this whole system down and rebuild, but until that happens, I sure do like the robots at McDonaldâ€™s.â€?\n\nThe Scottsdale storeâ€™s new manager, Peter Gibbons, told ABC News that he has worked with the robots at a product development facility in San Francisco for the last six months and speaks highly of the machines.\n\nâ€œThese things are great! They get their work done in a fast and orderly manner, plus they donâ€™t ask for cigarette breaks.â€?\n\n37-year-old Paul Horner, a spokesman for McDonaldâ€™s told reporters that because of the demand for a $15/hr minimum wage, the company has been playing with the idea of a restaurant run entirely by robots for years and believes their â€œMcRobotsâ€? are the answer.\n\nâ€œWith the high demand for a minimum wage of $15/hr and the protests getting worse every day, this is something we had to implement. Plus with the tremendous margin of human error, poor hygiene, lack of education, laziness, as well as the recent advancements in artificial intelligence it just make sense to automate our restaurants now rather than later.â€?\n\nSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate in Arizona with brand new socks told ABC News that she approves of a $15/hr minimum wage increase.\n\nâ€œWe see so many homeless people that work 40 hours a week, and that is just ridiculous,â€? Bradley said. â€œI think anyone not being claimed on someone elseâ€™s taxes deserves to make at least $15/hr. Some people just donâ€™t have the physical or mental capability to get better jobs or go to college. I think in a country as great as ours, it is just sad that there are so many adults working 40 hours a week that have to worry about putting a roof over their head and food in their belly.â€?\n\nLocal Phoenix resident, 52-year-old Tom Downey, who has been unemployed for the last 3 years, was excited about the opening of a nearby McDonaldâ€™s until he heard about the robots.\n\nâ€œNow that they hire only robots, I donâ€™t know what I can even do. I donâ€™t have an education, a car, and now Iâ€™m not gonna even be able to get a burger job. Just the thought of having to go to the state unemployment office and stand in line with those scumbags!â€?\n\n42-year-old Milton Waddams, an unemployed fast food worker, told reporters he is extremely disappointed by the decision to employ only robots instead of humans.\n\nâ€œThe McDonaldâ€™s had my resume, I had already completed two job interviews there and they said I was scheduled to work once the new store opened and said they would return my phone call but they never called,â€? Waddams said. â€œI need a job I said, and I was told by Betty in HR that they have my resume on file, but they never called, and Sandra told me to talk to Bill, and then I hear of the robots instead of regular humans and thatâ€™s not what I asked for. And I need the job I told them, but thereâ€™s robots, so now Iâ€™m going to have to find another place of employment. And they were big giant robots, and I said no, no robots at McDonaldâ€™s. I could set the building on fire.â€?\n\nFormer grill cook, Tom Smykowski, from the original Phoenix McDonaldâ€™s location before it was shutdown for robot repairs and upgrades, is still mad about losing his job.\n\nâ€œYou know there are people in this world who donâ€™t have to put up with all this?â€? Smykowski told FOX News. â€œYou see, thatâ€™s what you have to do. You have to use your mind and come up with some really great idea like that and you never have to work again,â€? but Smykowskiâ€™s friendly attitude suddenly turns to anger, â€œWell-well look. I already told you: I dealt with the go*damn employees so the customers would get the correct order. I have people skills; I am good at dealing with people. Canâ€™t you understand that? What the hell is wrong with you people?â€?\n\nHorner said he is excited to pave the way to a more automated workforce, hence a more reliable and affordable one.\n\nâ€œRobots are the future of McDonaldâ€™s in the United States and around the world,â€? Horner said, â€œHuman workers want more pay and this has created giant protests which need our attention now before it is too late. Robots will decrease prices, increase productivity and make for better food.â€? Horner continued, â€œHuman beings were not meant to stand and make burgers all day, filling out useless forms and listening to eight different bosses drone on about about mission statements. Now Iâ€™ve had a chance to meet with some of these robots, and boy, they are just straight shooters with upper management written all over them.â€?\n\nThe new robot McDonaldâ€™s will be located on the Southwest corner of Camelback and Miller. McDonaldâ€™s says that if the store is a success, 25,000 more robot-run restaurants will be built in the next three years. It is still unclear at this time what the robots look like or how customers will complete transactions as this information is being kept under strict confidentiality, but come July these questions will be answered. Will it be the right or wrong decision for McDonaldâ€™s? In the end, it will come down to what is best for the shareholders and the customer. The employees hoping to make $15/hr so they can afford basic human needs such as shelter and food; it looks like they will have to wait in line.\n\nIf you have any further questions about the robot-run establishment, McDonanldâ€™s has setup a 24-hour robot hotline at (785) 273-0325.',fake
'The Amish In America Commit Their Vote To Donald Trump; Mathematically Guaranteeing Him A Presidential Victory\nJimmy Rustling, ABC News\nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/amish-america-commit-vote-donald-trump-mathematically-guaranteeing-presidential-victory/\nUPDATE: THIS WORKED, GIVING DONALD TRUMP THE PRESIDENCY\n\nCOLUMBUS, OH (AP) â€” History was made today in Columbus, Ohio when more than 3 million Amish poured into the city to see the American Amish Brotherhood (AAB), an organization which acts as an informal governing body for the Amish community, endorse Donald Trump for president. That number represents a significant portion of the total Amish population, which the United States Census Bureau says numbers more than 20 million men and women nationwide all pledging their vote to Trump for President. With the full force of the Amish community behind him, Donald Trump is now mathematically guaranteed to win the presidency in November.\n\n\n\n\n \nThe organization typically meets once a year and the meetings usually consist of about 300 Amish leaders who meet to discuss the challenges, such as urban sprawl, that face the community. This year, however, the organization wanted as many people in attendance as possible so they can effectively instruct all Amish men and women of legal voting age to cast their vote for the flamboyant Republican nominee.\n\nThe Amish, who are direct descendants of the protestant reformation sect known as the Anabaptists, have typically stayed out of politics in the past. As a general rule, they donâ€™t vote, serve in the military, or engage in any other displays of patriotism. This year, however, the AAB has said that it is imperative that they get involved in the democratic process.\n\nâ€œOver the past eight years, the Democratic Party has launched a systematic assault on biblical virtues,â€? said AAB Chairman Elijah Fisher. â€œWe have seen more and more Christians being persecuted for their faith; we have seen the state defile the institution of marriage allowing the homogays to come together just like normal people. And now, they want to put a woman in the nationâ€™s highest leadership role in direct violation of my favorite Bible passage, 1 Timothy 2:12, â€˜I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quietâ€™.â€? Fisher continued, â€œWe need to stop this assault on God and take a stand for biblical principles. Donald Trump has shown in both action and deed that he is committed to restoring this country to the Lordâ€™s way.â€?\n\nAccording to statistician Nate Silver of the website fivethirtyeight.com, there are no possible scenarios in which Hillary Clinton can win with Donald Trump carrying the Amish vote.\n\nâ€œThe Amish have their highest numbers in perennial swing states like Pennsylvania, Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, and Iowa,â€? Silver noted. â€œThey also have strong numbers in reliably Democratic states like Michigan, Illinois, and New York, meaning that Hillary will lose those states as well. There is also a sizeable community in Florida which, while not as large as it is in the Midwest, is still large enough to turn Florida for Trump. Over the next two weeks, you can expect Hillary to enter into a state of freefall in all of my predictive models.â€?\n\n37-year-old Paul Horner, a self-proclaimed â€œDonald Trump supporter since day oneâ€? told Leilani Hernandez, a reporter with local Columbus news station WBNS-10TV he is thrilled that Trump will be the next President.\n\nâ€œThis is such great news, a Trump victory, I knew it would happen, I have been praying for it night and day,â€? Horner said. â€œPlus I work November 8th and it was going to be tough for me to get off work and vote because my boss is not the nicest of people. But now thanks to the great Amish people of this country, they have this thing locked up for a Donald Trump victory against crooked Hillary and I wonâ€™t have to miss work! God is good!â€?\n\nThe Clinton campaign issued a written statement to the AAB asking them to reconsider their decision.\n\n\n\n\n \nâ€œI donâ€™t believe that Donald Trump is the person who best represents your interests,â€? Clinton wrote to the AAB. â€œAs a career real estate developer, he represents a clear threat to your simple way of life. As former first lady of Arkansas, I understand the concerns of rural Americans more than any candidate in this election. I implore you to consider all of the facts before voting for my opponent.â€?\n\nMost pundits believe that Mrs. Clintonâ€™s plea is too little too late.\n\nDuring a press conference in Manhattan early this morning, Trump thanked the AAB for their support and promised to put the Amish to work maintaining government buildings, which he said would save taxpayers millions because â€œthe Amish do great work, the best work, for a very low price.â€?\n\nThough Clinton has pledged to stay in the race until the very end, many of her campaign workers have already resigned. According to the Associated Press, it is expected that the Clinton campaign will lose 50\% of its staff within the next week. There is a general mood of hopelessness and despair in the Clinton camp, and many simply want to cut their losses.\n\nâ€œIt looked like she was going to win this election easily,â€? said Tom Downey, a campaign manager in Ohio, â€œBut this is what happens when you wake a sleeping giant. Clearly, Mrs. Clinton took far too much for granted in this race, and we are all now paying the price. Itâ€™s really sad to see the campaign end this way.â€?\n\nThe AAB chooses weekly charities for those wishing to support what they do. The AABâ€™s charity for the week of November 4th is Sock It Forward, a charity that provides the homeless with brand new socks.

'Sahitya Academy has decided to award 5 writers with a cash prize of 1 lakh rupees and a plaque each for their outstanding articles about the struggles of Indian citizens against the backdrop of a wicked demonetization. The cash prize will be transferred to their accounts to avoid any inconvenience.Soon after the news of demonetization broke, thousands of people thronged ATMs in various cities to withdraw cash, and an equal number of articles, depicting their ordeal, were published on select media outlets. Talented writers across the nation gave wings to their imagination and produced heart-wrenching stories of middle and lower middle class families during an emergency-like situation inflicted on them by a fascist government.Experts believe the decision of Sahitya Academy, to encourage budding writers in their creative pursuits, is a move in the right direction to revive literary fiction in India.We had a chance to interact with one of the writers whose story has been shortlisted by the committee, and we asked him about his story.“It’s a murder mystery,” he replied nonchalantly, “The story is about a man who kills someone at the ATM for 2500 rupees.”“Wow, that’s something different from what we have read so far. Can you reveal some of the details?” we asked.“Ok, see this story is about a man who has to pay his rent on 14th…”“But isn’t he already too late?”“He pays his rent on 14th. Do you have any problem with that? Now don’t interrupt me when I am narrating the story. So, he has to pay a rent of 5000 rupees, and at the same time Modi bans all 500 and 1000 rupee notes…”“But Modi announced this on 8th and he pays his rent on 14th. So he had 7 days to withdraw the cash.”“He was out of station.”“But there are ATMs in other…ok, please continue.”“So, he logs into his account to transfer the fund to his landlord’s account, but he cannot remember his password because of the situation created by Modi. He clicks forgot password option but his mobile runs out of battery.”“Wow, that’s interesting.”We grabbed a handful of popcorn as the story took an interesting twist.“He rushes to the nearest ATM and withdraws 2500 rupees, but he needs another 2500,” he paused for dramatic effect and said, “He kills a man standing in the queue.”“In front of so many people! Cannot they see him?”“No, because he is wearing a mask. Now he enters the ATM again and withdraws another 2500 rupees.”“But PIN…”“Haha, the PIN is his year of birth.”“You mean the murderer’s or the victim’s?”“The victim’s of course because that’s his card.”“Oh ok, but how did the murderer know his year of birth.”“Because in the same year Sachin Tendulkar made his international debut. Got it?”“Umm, ok. But don’t you think he could just kill the landlord instead of killing a random person?”“No, because he is getting married to his landlord’s daughter.”“Ok so, how is this murder solved?”“Ok so, here’s how it goes. No one knows who did it. Police is clueless…but the ATM card is not.”“Oh…my…God, we completely forgot about the ATM card.”“Yes, now the card takes revenge on behalf of its owner.”“Like how the dog did in Teri Meherbaniyan?”“Kind of, but the dog in Teri Meherbaniyan addresses the issue in an aggressive manner but the ATM card in my story opts for a subtle approach. The card has a camera on it and it clicks photographs of the killer, which it later sends to the police.”“How…I mean, ok. So, does he get caught in the end?”“For that you have to read the entire story.”“Is there anything left?”“Yes the final paragraph. So what do you think?”“Brilliant! No wonder they selected your story. I mean, we got to know about Sahitya Academy Award only last year when a few recipients returned…but I am sure, it’s a huge recognition.”“Do you think I have a chance of winning it?”“Absolutely. Keep up the good work. Bharat tere tukde honge,” we concluded the interview on a happy note.',fake
'Finally the suspense is over. Ae Dil Hai Mushkil will release on 28th after a deal was brokered in a high profile meet attended by Karan Johar and Raj Thackeray. Not satisfied with assurances that no actor from neighboring country will be hired in future considering the mood of the nation, the pre-condition set by MNS was that the producers will have to pay a ‘penance’ cost to the Army welfare fund for casting Pakistan actors. The producers agreed to this after doing their Math. The amount of free publicity that they had garnered due to the ongoing tussle meant they had saved enough to donate. Wonder if the army men are happy with this forced goodwill gesture from both sides!Buoyed by their victory of sorts, MNS has gone ahead and released a series of pre-conditions to people who want to live and conduct business in Maharashtra in future.1) Every film maker making a film with only Indian actors would get a ‘reward’ compensation irrespective of the fate of the film at box office collected from film makers who have ever made a film with any Pakistani in their lives.2) Every business man who exports goods and services to Pakistan will have to either shut down business immediately even if it means loss of livelihood or pay ‘patriotism’ cost to stay safe in the state.3) Anyone from other states entering Maharashtra would first have to pay a ‘penance’ cost for being born outside Maharashtra if they wished to earn their living there.4) Everyone who has had any Pakistani link ever in the past but doesn’t have it any more will have to pay a onetime ‘repentance’ cost to ensure his well being in the country. Going further, MNS has launched a lucrative scheme which says that all people who have still not revealed their Pakistani association (via chat, FB, old friendship, etc) are allowed a 10 day ‘Voluntary Disclosure of Association Scheme’. They too can pay the repentance cost and secure their future against random attacks by MNS.5) All people living in the cities and town falling in Maharashtra where MNS representative is not elected in the next elections will have to pay a ‘my mistake’ cost each time some important work of general public good is undertaken in the constituency. This will safeguard them against vandalism and protect against the loss of public property in their area.*The amount for each violation will depend on the stakes involved.Hearing this, the D-company has threatened filing a case in International Court of Underworld Justice against MNS. Issuing a statement from Karachi, their spokesperson argued that they hold the patent for protection money with their pioneering work in ‘hafta vasooli’.',fake

'NBA Cancels 2017 All-Star Game In North Carolina Over Anti-LGBT Law\nJimmy Rustling, ABC News\nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/nba-cancels-all-star-game-in-north-carolina-lgbt-hb2/\nCharlotte, NC â€” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver held a press conference today, announcing that Charlotte, North Carolina will no longer be hosting the 2017 All-Star game due to the stateâ€™s recent passing of the anti-LGBT law HB2.\n\nâ€œWith this new law in place, Charlotte currently does not have any anti-discrimination protection in place, something that would be vital for a large event such as the All-Star Game,â€? Silver told reporters. â€œWe are giving the state of North Carolina 30 days to repeal this law or they can expect the 2017 All-Star game to be held elsewhere. I want to make it clear that the NBA will not stand for this type of intolerance and hate.â€?\n\nSilverâ€™s comments come just weeks after the North Carolina legislature passed HB2, the Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act, which requires transgender people (and everyone else) to use public restrooms according to the biological sex on their birth certificate. The new law also strips North Carolina workers of the ability to sue under a state anti-discrimination law, a right that has been upheld in court since 1985.\n\nâ€œIf you were fired because of your race, fired because of your gender, fired because of your religion,â€? said Allan Freyer, head of the Workersâ€™ Rights Project at the North Carolina Justice Center in Raleigh, â€œYou no longer have a basic remedy.â€?\n\nSince Governor Pat McCrory signed HB2 into law last month, well over 1,000 jobs have been moved out of state, and over 100 companies, including Facebook, Apple, Paypal, Pyramid Country and StopPack, have expressed concern or anger, warning they may move or cancel plans to expand, costing the state millions of dollars. In addition to that, by not hosting the 2017 NBA All-Star game, the state stands to lose even more. It is uncertain the exact figure, but in 2014, the All-Star game in New Orleans generated $106.1 Million and in 2015, New York generated approximately $195 million in economic activity.\n\nOn Friday, Bruce Springsteen cancelled his concert in Greensboro because of North Carolinaâ€™s controversial new LGBT bill stating, â€œWith deepest apologies to our dedicated fans in Greensboro, we have canceled our show scheduled for Sunday, April 10th. Some things are more important than a rock show and this fight against prejudice and bigotry â€” which is happening as I write â€” is one of them. It is the strongest means I have for raising my voice in opposition to those who continue to push us backwards instead of forwards.â€?\n\nEarlier this week, a womenâ€™s advocacy group, UltraViolet, began circulating an online petition urging Nike and PepsiCo â€” two chief sponsors of previous NBA All-Star weekends â€” to not support the 2017 event if it is held in Charlotte. There is also a new campaign in North Carolina encouraging people to call McCroryâ€™s office every time they use a public restroom to report on their compliance with the law.\n\nNorth Carolina has become a fierce battleground for culture war issues. Since the GOP captured the legislature in 2010 and the governorship in 2012, thereâ€™s been a steady stream of conservative changes, from much stricter voter laws to looser gun laws to overhauling taxes. The legislature even considered a proposal to establish Christianity as the official state religion.\n\nMarina Mangiaracina, a transgender individual, who is a journalist for SB Nation, does not agree with the new law.\n\nâ€œFirst of all, no one carries around their birth certificate. How is a cop going to check what gender a person has on that document? Second of all, the policy of refusing to change the gender on your birth certificate until you have sex reassignment surgery is dangerous. Not all trans people need, want, or can afford sexual reassignment surgery. Itâ€™s an extremely delicate and risky procedure that costs anywhere from $7,000 to $50,000. Not to mention all of the missed work in the weeks of recovery. Forcing, or even encouraging transgendered people to have that surgery is sickening. If the person wants the surgery, thatâ€™s one thing. But not everybody can afford that surgery. It simply discriminates against the poor.â€?\n\nSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, told ABC News that the new law needs to be repealed.\n\nâ€œThis is a ridiculous law that makes absolutely no sense,â€? Bradley said. â€œAccording to the law, a transgender man, a person with a vagina but has male features, such as a beard, now has to go into the womenâ€™s bathroom. Then the police get called. How exactly do they verify whatâ€™s going on there? Does the transgender man have to drop his pants or is that person required to be carrying their birth certificate at all times? And according to the idiots behind this law, itâ€™s about stopping sexual predators. How? Is it really that hard for a man to put on a wig and a Hillary suit and go into the womenâ€™s restroom? No. This law is about bigotry, hate, intolerance and taking away human rights from the LGBT community.â€?\n\nDavid Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, told ABC News that his wife Barbara is transgender.\n\nâ€œStories like this have helped put my children through college, buy a new car, a home and even get the surgery my wife Barbara wanted; her name actually used to be Ted,â€? Mikkleson laughs, â€œWe claim â€˜to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as wellâ€˜, but thatâ€™s just ridiculous. Do you know how much time that would take? Instead, we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours, write a couple sentences, and thatâ€™s it. I just want to be clear, our website does zero journalism or anything creative, and Iâ€™m only telling you this for legal reasons. For example, look at this article we wrote about Scientology supposedly losing its tax-exempt status. What is the name of the person or website responsible for the hoax? We claim to know it, since we list the websiteâ€™s disclaimer; but no real information is there. We even go as far as saying the site that started the story spreads malware and viruses, but we donâ€™t say what website it is. I think warning people about a website that could potentially destroy their computer is probably a good idea, and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism, but thatâ€™s a lot of work and people will click our ads regardless, bottom line; so why do the extra work? And lots of people complain, but since we block archive.org it just becomes their word versus ours.â€? Mikkelson breaks down in tears, â€œAnyway, about my transgender wife Barbara; so brave.â€?\n\nPaul Horner, owner of the Phoenix Suns, told ABC News he approves of the NBAâ€™s decision but believes more should be done.\n\nâ€œI applaud the NBA in taking a stand against this type of discrimination and pulling the All-Star game from Charlotte. Furthermore, I believe itâ€™s time for Charlotte Hornets owner Michael Jordan to take a stand against this law and move the team out of that backwards state.â€?\n\nAt this time, unless the North Carolina legislature repeals HB2, it is unclear where the 2017 All-Star game will be held.',fake
'Finance ministry on Tuesday announced major infrastructure projects that would be taken up in the coming days which included 34,800 kms of roads to be built and it will see investment of Rs. 5, 35,000 crores over next five years.

In fact Faking News found that by the time Jaitley and his team finished the presentation, 50 \% of the announced roads were already constructed.The presentation was very detailed with separate slides for separate sectors. Every team member got an opportunity to present 4-5 slides. There was equal distribution just the way how B-School students divide their presentation parts just the day before their final presentation in front of the class. The thank you slide was well made and it was the slide whole media was waiting for as they were too tired of the long presentation. The ‘Any Questions?’ slide generated least amount of interest as by the time this slide got displayed, 90 \% of the journalists were fast asleep. One thing the finance ministry missed out was the ‘urprise test’ round where they could have actually asked question to media based on the presentation. This way they could have arrived upon the number of people actually paying attention during the ppt.Arun Jaitley ji has promised that in future also such detailed ppts will be conducted so that people are aware of India’s financial condition and also they know about the way forward. faking News also found some college students downloading the ppt from the finance ministry website and using them directly for their presentations on finance subjects, and well, scoring good marks too.',fake
'North Carolina Governor Sets Up Hotline To Report Anyone Not Using Correct Bathroom\nJimmy Rustling, ABC News\nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/nc-governor-hb2-hotline-report-correct-bathroom/\nRaleigh, NC â€” At a press conference today, North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory took further steps to ensure that his controversial bill, HB2, will be upheld when it comes to law enforcement. McCrory announced that his office has setup a 24-hour hotline for individuals to call if they witness someone not abiding by the new law.\n\nâ€œIf you see a woman, who doesnâ€™t look like a woman, using the womanâ€™s restroom, be vigilant, call the hotline, and report that individual.â€?

Horner said. â€œWe encourage North Carolinaâ€™s residents to take photographs and report as much detail as possible when calling. With the information gathered from this hotline, weâ€™ll be working closely with local law enforcement agencies to make sure this law is enforced and those who break the law see jail bars. We are sending a clear message to all the transsexuals out there; their illegal actions and deviant behavior will no longer be tolerated in the state of North Carolina.â€?\n\nâ€œI applaud HB2, the offender hotline they setup and Governor Pat McCrory,â€? North Carolina resident Steve Jenkins told local news station WTVD. â€œAs a man, how would some women like it if I followed her into the restroom and just told her that everything is OK because Iâ€™m transgender? She wouldnâ€™t like it at all, and thatâ€™s why you need a law like HB2.â€?\n\nSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, told ABC News HB2 and the new hotline make no sense.\n\nâ€œIn the history of North Carolina, not one sexually related criminal act has happened in a bathroom by someone who is transgender. No arrests, no convictions, but they still want to make laws, just in case that â€œone timeâ€? ever happens. Itâ€™s like making laws outlawing marijuana in the event that someone actually ever dies from it,â€? Bradley said. â€œThere were plenty of laws already in place before HB2. It doesnâ€™t matter if youâ€™re a man, woman, transgender, or what bathroom you use; if youâ€™re in there longer than 5 minutes after using the restroom, someone is going to call the cops. This new law is about people living in fear, gathering together around their weird ideologies and religious beliefs to create more intolerance and hate in this world, bottom line.â€?\n\nâ€œI donâ€™t want my money, my taxes going towards anything that discriminates against anyone, especially in public bathrooms,â€? said North Carolina resident, Steven Hamilton. â€œI donâ€™t care what a private individual or business does and how hate-filled they want to be, because I can protest and show as much discontent towards them as I want to, but when it comes to my money, those places better be free for all to use, no matter what sexual identity a person may identify with.â€? Hamilton continued, â€œAlso, I have an eight-year-old daughter who I donâ€™t like using the restroom by herself. What am I supposed to do now? Take her into the womenâ€™s bathroom and hope I donâ€™t get arrested or take her with me into the menâ€™s restroom and hope the cops donâ€™t get called? And what if the cops show up and I donâ€™t have my birth certificate on me? Would I actually go to jail? All of this is completely insane.â€?\n\nSince Governor Pat McCrory signed HB2 into law last month, well over 1,000 jobs have been moved out of state, and over 400 companies, including Facebook, Apple, Paypal, Pyramid Country and StopPack, have expressed concern or anger, warning they may move or cancel plans to expand, costing the state millions of dollars. Entertainers such as Pearl Jam, Ringo Starr, Bryan Adams, Bruce Springsteen and Cirque du Soleil have also canceled their performances in North Carolina to boycott the law. Pressure has been put on the NBA to cancel the All-Star game in North Carolina next year, though as of yet, the league is not budging. It is still unclear what kind of an economic impact these boycotts will have on the stateâ€™s economy as a whole. NBC estimates that North Carolina has lost $186 million in revenue due to boycotts so far.\n\nTo report suspicious bathroom activity, North Carolina residents can call the â€˜HB2 Offender Hotlineâ€™ at 1-800-662-7952.

'$429.6 Million Powerball Winner In New Jersey Comes Forward\nJimmy Rustling, ABC News\nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/powerball-winner-in-new-jersey-comes-forward/\nTRENTON N.J. (AP) â€” This afternoon lottery officials were pleased to announce that the sole winner in last nightâ€™s record setting, $429.6 million Powerball drawing, has come forward. That lucky person is 37-year-old Paul Horner from Trenton, New Jersey. Horner won by matching all five white balls and the red Powerball.\n\nThe winning Powerball numbers in Saturdayâ€™s drawing were 5, 25, 26, 44 and 66, and the Powerball number was 9.\n\nMost people would be ecstatic about their new found riches, but not Horner. As it turns out Horner was already New Jerseyâ€™s third wealthiest resident. With this lottery win, Horner will now be a contender for richest person living in the state of New Jersey. Horner made most of his wealth on Wall Street. Last yearâ€™s tax return show him reporting a little over $800,000,000 and because of some questionable accounting he paid only 1\% in taxes.\n\nLocal news station WABC caught up with Mr. Horner as he was leaving the New Jersey Lottery Headquarters this morning.\n\nâ€œThis money will help me fix up my numerous estates and multiple golf courses in the Cayman Islands. Iâ€™m actually kind of bummed about winning because I know there is really no way around paying the full amount of taxes that Iâ€™ll owe on this. I guess for a moment or so Iâ€™ll have to join the â€˜regularsâ€™ and pay my fair share. Maybe when Iâ€™m done paying all those taxes Iâ€™ll go down to a local bar and have a domestic beer with the common folk there, just to get a quick taste of what that horrible life would be like,â€? Horner laughs. â€œTo be honest, most of this money will end up going to campaign contributions for Donald Trump. It is important to me that I be the most Patriotic, God-fearing, loving Christian, and that is why it is so necessary to kick out all the Muslims, Mexicans and other undesirables in this country. We can make American great again!â€?\n\nWhen asked how he came up with the winning numbers, Horner said, â€œWhen I played before I let the riffraff behind the counter pick the numbers for me and of course I didnâ€™t win, so this time I went with numbers that have a special place close to my heart. I currently own five Bugattiâ€™s. I own 25 apartment complexes. I own twenty-six different multinational corporations. I spent forty-four million dollars on my last yacht and I own real estate in sixty-six different countries. As for the Powerball number of nine; I meant to put down the number nineteen, because that is how old one of my girlfriends is, but the dingus behind the counter must have dropped the one.â€?\n\nOn Wall Street Hornerâ€™s nickname is â€˜The Gutterâ€™.\n\nâ€œHe basically buys up a company, fires everybody, puts them all out on the street. Then when the stock price goes up he sells everything off and just walks away. Heâ€™s such an a*shole. We all just love him here,â€? Tom Downey of Goldman Sachs told ABC News.\n\nLottery officials are still not sure what to make of the winner who matched all six numbers correctly.\n\nâ€œHeâ€™s a bad personâ€?, said lottery official Tim Parkos. â€œIâ€™m kind of sad that this thing is finally over. That money was growing into something really amazing. With all of that money you could feed most of the worldâ€™s starving children, provide the homeless with new socks, or build clean drinking water systems in every third world country. Iâ€™m pretty sure there is no God when a guy like Paul Horner becomes the winner of something this special.â€?\n\nThough not everyone feels that Horner is such a bad guy. Hornerâ€™s cousin, Alex Horner, told ABC News he only has praise and good things to say about his relative.\n\nâ€œYeah Paul is a good guy, no matter what most people say. Even though we grew up a few states apart we always managed to get together and hang like bros. Like this one time I was training for my high school golf tournament and got to practice at his private golf course resort in the Cayman Islands. Itâ€™s like $600 a round for the public but he was nice enough to give me the family 10\% discount since I played after 3PM. Heâ€™s always looking out for the fam like that. I think its super cool heâ€™s donating to politics and stuff, pretty noble of him.â€?\n\nSarah Bradley, founder of Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she does not agree with Horner winning the Powerball.\n\nâ€œThat money could have gone to something great, and now it will be just wasted on some rich fat cat, the same people that are driving out the middle and lower class in this country. Maybe Horner will find it in his heart to do something that actually helps humanity. Like what we do, giving out new socks to the homeless. It doesnâ€™t get any better or more rewarding than that.â€?\n\nHornerâ€™s winning ticket was purchased at a 7-Eleven store in Trenton, according to Courtney Groves with the New Jersey Lottery.\n\nSaturdayâ€™s jackpot was the 7th largest Powerball jackpot in U.S. history. The Powerball is played in California and 43 other states, plus Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Tickets cost $2 apiece, and drawings take place at 7:59 p.m. PT every Wednesday and Saturday.',fake
'Michael Jordan To North Carolina: â€˜HB2 Goes Or The Charlotte Hornets Goâ€™\nJimmy Rustling, ABC News\nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/michael-jordan-hb2-goes-or-the-charlotte-hornets-go/\nCHARLOTTE N.C. (AP) â€” NBA legend and Charlotte Hornetsâ€˜ owner, Michael Jordan, held a press conference today, announcing his intentions to move the Hornets out of North Carolina if the state does not revoke its controversial HB2 law.\n\nâ€œWith this new law in place, North Carolina currently does not have any anti-discrimination protection in place, something that is vital, not just for our fans but for everyone,â€? Jordan told reporters. â€œWe are giving the state of North Carolina 30 days to repeal this law or they can expect the the Charlotte Hornets to play elsewhere. I want to make it clear that neither the Hornets nor I will not stand for this type of intolerance and hate.â€?\n\nJordanâ€™s comments come after the North Carolina legislature passed HB2 back in March, a law which requires transgender individuals to use public restrooms according to the biological sex on their birth certificate.\n\nPaul Horner, a spokesman for the Charlotte Hornets, told ABC News that the team is currently talking to several cities about a possible relocation if the state decides to keep HB2 intact.\n\nâ€œWe are currently in talks with certain individuals in the cities of Austin and Seattle, among others,â€? Horner said. â€œWe sincerely hope it does not come to moving the team, but in the event North Carolina does not revoke the law, we must be prepared for the worse.â€?\n\nSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, told ABC News that she agrees with Michael Jordan taking a stand against North Carolina and HB2.\n\nâ€œIf anyone can get a bigoted law like HB2 revoked, itâ€™s Michael Jordan,â€? Bradley said. â€œThere were plenty of laws already in place before HB2. It doesnâ€™t matter if youâ€™re a man, woman, transgender, or what bathroom you use; if youâ€™re in there longer than five minutes after using the restroom, someone is going to call the cops. Creepy men or women doing creepy things in a restroom gets you on a sex offender list and you go to prison for such crimes. In fact, in the history of North Carolina, not one transgender individual has ever been convicted of a sexually related crime in a restroom. This new law is about people living in fear, gathering together around their weird ideologies and religious beliefs to create more intolerance and hate in this world, bottom line. This ridiculous law has also given me insight into the working mind of a far right-wing Republican. Apparently there are serious amounts of orgies and other sexual activities going on in bathrooms that I never knew about.â€? Bradley laughs, â€œOn a serious note; I sincerely want to thank everyone that has donated socks or money to our cause â€˜Sock It Forwardâ€™. Socks are the least donated items but the most desired; it helps the homeless so much and your support has put smiles on so many faces. Thank you.â€?\n\nSince Governor Pat McCrory signed HB2 into law back in March, well over 5,000 jobs have been moved out of state, and over 400 companies, including Facebook, Apple, Paypal, Pyramid Country and StopPack, have expressed concern or anger, warning they may move or cancel plans to expand, costing the state millions of dollars. Entertainers such as Pearl Jam, Ringo Starr, Bryan Adams, Bruce Springsteen and Cirque du Soleil have also canceled their performances in North Carolina to boycott the law. Pressure has been put on the NBA to cancel the All-Star game in North Carolina next year and this week NBA Commissioner Adam Silver clarified the leagueâ€™s willingness to move the 2017 All-Star Game out of Charlotte if North Carolina legislators do not overturn the new state law. It is still unclear what kind of an economic impact these boycotts will have on the stateâ€™s economy as a whole. NBC estimates that North Carolina has lost $186 million in revenue due to boycotts so far. ABC News puts that figure well above $300 million.\n\nJordan finished the press conference by reiterating his demands.\n\nâ€œAs my organization has stated previously, the Charlotte Hornets and Hornets Sports & Entertainment are opposed to discrimination in any form, and we have always sought to provide an inclusive environment,â€? Jordan said. â€œAs has been the case since the building opened, we will continue to ensure that all fans, players and employees feel welcome while at work or attending NBA games. If that means moving the team out of the state if North Carolina doesnâ€™t repeal HB2, then that is what we are prepared to do. I urge you all to call Governor Pat McCroryâ€™s Office and voice your concerns. Together we can keep the Hornets in North Carolina!â€?\n\nNorth Carolina residents can call Gov.

'Bengaluru: It has been two days, Prakash is unable to come to terms not because he met with an accident. His problem is for a change he was following traffic rule for the first time, someone came from behind and hit him on the back side.While speaking to our reporter from hospital bed Prakash with a broken leg & hand under plaster said, “I do not know what happened to me, I was following traffic rule. Maybe it’s a classic case of brain fade which happened to the likes of Australian captain Steve Smith in the past. Thanks to my connections, a person like me has never bothered about following rules even when traffic cops are around.”Prakash added, “Sometime back my friends took me to an eye specialist thinking I have some color blindness problem as all signals red, yellow, green looked same to me. Simply because I never looked at signals or on my speedometer. One of my friend says not only when I ‘jumped’ the signal it was green, I was even under the speed limits. The alcohol readings are also within the limits as I can see from the reports.”“For fifteen years, I am driving my bike on these roads. Of course, with a driving license RTO guys delivered at my home, but I did not know what is called Zebra crossing. Other day my niece was asking about it showing me a picture, I told her may be for some decorative purpose traffic cops paint some portion of the road near signals. After her school teacher scolded and told her about it, I came to know about it from her,” said Prakash.Police has traced the culprit behind Prakash’s accident. While speaking to us a traffic constable said, “Like Prakash, the person who hit him was following traffic rule for the first time. We cannot arrest him, as he has also connections at the top. With so much risk for people following rules, traffic police is going to put a disclaimer at all major signals, Follow traffic rules at your own risk.”',fake
'A few weeks ago, on August 21st, Retired Admiral Ace Lyons, former Commander-in-Chief of the US Pacific Fleet, addressed a gathering of Republicans at the Luxe Hotel in Los Angeles. He began by asking his audience, “Are you ready to take back America?” Following their affirmative response, Admiral Lyons says, “Your presence here says it all. You understand we have not only a constitutional crisis but a national security crisis.”Lyons asks what our conservative leadership has done, saying, “Our conservative leadership has failed to understand they were given control of Congress to stop the fundamental transformation of America, not to facilitate it. And then, what did they do? They funded all of ‘president’ Obama’s illegal programs. While at the same time ignoring his over fourteen impeachable offenses. This is unconscionable. So, where do we go from there?”Admiral Lyons said, “You know we have, as ‘president’ Obama has said, he wants to fundamentally transform America. Well what is it? Well let me tell you. It’s un-American, it’s anti-Western, but pro-Islam, pro-Iranian, and pro-Muslim Brotherhood. You have to ask yourself, why would an American ‘president’ embrace the Muslim Brotherhood, whose creed is to destroy us from within, with our own miserable hand, and replace our Constitution with Draconian Sharia Law?”Lyons continues, “Now you understand we have a serious national security crisis. When you have a ‘president,’ who is not interested in America leading, or America winning, then you know the greatest threat to our national security resides at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. We have a ‘president’ who refuses to identify the enemy. It was Erdogan, when he was prime minister of Turkey who said it best. ‘Islam is Islam. There are no modifiers. Democracy is the train we ride to our ultimate objective, which is to make Islam dominant throughout the world.’ He couldn’t have said it any plainer.”“Islam is a totalitarian ideology,” says Lyons, “bent on world domination, masquerading as a religion.” He goes on to explain he rejects the term “radical Islam,” saying, “That implies there’s some moderate Islam. There ain’t any and you all know it but you’ve got to get the word out.” Admiral Lyons points to the failure of leadership among the West as well as Pope Francis in refusing to support Egypt’s president el-Sisi. He also mentions the insanely destructive Muslim outreach program of Pope Frank and his declarations that Islam is a religion of peace, saying, “This is non-sense.”He goes on to describe how Obama and the globalists are following the exact prescription for the destruction of a nation here in the United States, beginning with the destruction of our military, including sequestration and social engineering of the military by civilians who are themselves not worthy for military service. He addresses the mental disorder of transgender individuals who are now being embraced by the military leadership.He addresses the agreement that isn’t an agreement, the Iranian nuke deal which has never been signed. Obama gave them the money anyway, whatever his true motivations were. He notes that John Kerry gave up more than our objectives in his kabuki dance negotiations, “he gave up our honor. He gave away everything that we sought to obtain, and then to keep the Iranians at the table, we had to invent new concessions.” Lyons goes on to talk a little bit about the Iranians.He describes how Obama’s treason against the United States began even before he was “elected,” that he sent word to the Iranians urging them to not make any deals with the Bush administration because Obama was their friend and he’d make a better deal. That’s possibly the only time Obama has told the truth in 8 years.While Admiral Lyons believes that the actions of Obama with the Iranians bordered on treason, he says there is no doubt with Libya and Benghazi and the “pathological liar” Hillary Clinton. He says if you take nothing else away, understand that in Libya America “switched sides in the global war on terror. They knew they were funding al-Qaeda militias, the Muslim Brotherhood controlled militias and those rebels in Syria who morphed into ISIS. They provided them training, funding and weapons, there’s no question about it.”He points to the many shortcomings and failures of Clinton in Libya and Benghazi, many of them due to reckless disregard and cautions his audience, and all of us, that the “pathological liar who couldn’t handle the security of a pissant 13 acre compound in Benghazi and you now want to turn over the security of this great country to her?

'Never in my life have I seen a political hit job like the targeting Donald Trump. Thanks to Wikileaks, we now know that the liberal media bias is not some right wing conspiracy. Hillary Clinton is pushing outright lies and “news” outlets, such as CNN, are reporting them as if they were fact.This week, CNN has been in full force with their attempts to paint Trump as a rapist. They have interviewed every woman from Trump’s past who had something negative to say about him. They referred to these women as “victims” while minimizing Bill Clinton’s REAL rape victims by calling them “accusers”.The liberal bias has never been more apparent than it was this week. The Hillary campaign was SURE their lies would ruin Trump, they were wrong.New polls released today show Trump has actually closed the gap and is now in the margin of error with Hillary Clinton.From the Washington Post: It seems that American voters have a problem blindly believing women who claimed to be traumatized by Trump 30 years ago, but didn’t really feel the need to express it until 3 weeks before an election. Voters were also skeptical about the fact that Trump’s accusers just happen to be donors and supporters of Hillary Clinton.That wasn’t the only good news, The new polls also showed that Trump holds an almost 90\% support rate among Republican voters, even after all the media lies about him. On top of that, reports show that hundreds of thousands of swing state voters are switching from Democrat to Republican. Most people don’t realize that pollsters can only ask voters questions if they have been registered with the party for more than one year. Since all of these voters have switched parties this year, they can not participate in polls.It looks like the liberal media lies aren’t working this time. Americans are on to Hillary’s plan and it is backfiring…BIG TIME!',fake

But he soon realized how ‘less happening’ is life was only after a few casual scrolls of his friend’s FB pages.With most of his friends posting pictures of exotic foreign locations with their better halves while Tarun himself was slogging it out in an 18 hour shift in his company, he couldn’t take it anymore and thought it would be better if he just deleted his account to avoid any further inferiority complex.But family members say that has not helped much and Tarun has already started showing signs of borderline depression. His colleagues at work has something similar to say. “The other day I saw him wearing a ‘Being Worthless’ t-shirt,” said one co-worker.Initially reluctant, Tarun opened up later and said, “All this while I was made to believe that getting a degree, then a job and then uploading my honeymoon pics on FB would be a good indication that I have arrived. But I was wrong. Most of my friends have such fancy designations that it will put even Mark Zuckerberg to shame. One of them has put his as ‘CEO of Unemployed’. Some have completed marathon’s and I find it difficult to walk up to the corner shop.”When questioned if he was overeacting by deleting his account, Tarun said, “What’s the point in having one. None of my posts get any attention. A pouting selfie gets more likes and comments like ‘hotness ki dukaan’ than something sensible that I share.”Psychiatrists that time spent on social media is raising anxiety levels among youth and is a cause of concern. “I wouldn’t say the Tarun is an under-achiever. At least he has deleted his FB account. That is the first step to achieve something,” said one Psychiatrist while speaking to our reporter.',fake

'BANGALORE (THE REAL FAKE NEWS)- Men’s Hostel residents woke up on Friday to some distressing news. After following government directives to link their Aadhar number to their Mess Coupons in order that they may avail of benefits such as lunch, chicken and egg, with, according to the menu, the latter coming first.Outraged, many male students began a fast unto death. Protest leader, and guy who comes to dinner early just to get the best piece, Shubyanshu Sinha, said “We are tired of the despotic tyranny unleashed by MessComm, and we will stand for it no longer. A fast was the natural option, since there is nothing worthwhile to eat in the mess now anyway”. When asked whether he had got his Aadhar made, he bashfully said “Yes, yes, I’m going tomorrow”, a statement a close friend tells us he has been making for the past 6 months.When interviewed, the Convenor of MessComm said, “It is simply the only decision we could have took. We are following the government’s lead. I mean, if the government can disallow BPL families from getting the ration they are entitled to because the electricity went out and a fingerprint scanner is not working, linking Aadhar to mess coupons is the least we can do. We all have to chip in. It’s a patriotic effort. Think of our soldiers at the border.”At press time, we found a flourishing black market in omelettes, butter and milk between the students who had got their Aadhar cards made and those who had once read half of Atlas Shrugged and now claimed to be Libertarian.',fake

'Trump supporters have allowed a false narrative to creep into the election and take on the acceptance, stature and significance of a fact. It’s a dangerous argument that has fundamentally weakened our position and our candidate. That argument is one heard far and wide, that this race has two deeply flawed candidates. Americans need to listen to what they’re saying, analyze and recognize it for the nonsensical political babble that it is.It’s a half truth. There is one highly flawed person in the two person race, a criminal that has sold out her nation and continues to do so even during the heat of the battle for the presidency. There is one habitual liar who has admitted that she has a public position and a private position on even the most important issues, who serves at the pleasure the globalists who finance not only her campaign but every other aspect her miserable, corrupt existence, doing their bidding in destroying the United States in every manner imaginable.There is one candidate who does not give a damn about the Constitution, our bill of rights, our sovereignty or the rule of law. She is on the record as having stating her willingness and desire to flood this nation with foreigners of every description, legalizing all those who have violated our immigration laws within the first one hundred days and drastically increasing the number of Islamic terrorists that she allows into the United States. She will do so while endangering the lives of innocent Americans in the process, as a paid harlot of the America-haters, with no idea or concern of the type of individual she is bringing in or how many Americans will die as a result. The Marxist agenda and her fascist cronies will be served, not the American people.That is the terribly flawed candidate, Hillary Clinton. A criminal, a lifelong Marxist who has a history of intimate association with the communist party, a pathological liar who hates America, who will accelerate the Obama agenda of fundamental transformation to the point America is completely unrecognizable.Contrasted against that defective subhuman mongrel we are fortunate to have chosen an America-loving patriot as her opponent, Donald Trump. He’s a man who doesn’t lie to us and is criticized by the deceivers for his honesty and straight talk. He’s a man who is fighting a battle that no other candidate in the history of this nation has had to fight. Trump stands alone against the fascists, the globalists, the establishment, the academics, the Marxists, the foreigners, the terrorist sympathizers, the profiteers, the faux environmentalists, the Democrats, the social program parasites, the media whores and every other group that feeds off of the destruction and pillaging of the United States.We have a rare man in Donald Trump who has the strength of character and the will to stand up to this onslaught. He’s a man running for the right reasons, in service to his country and his fellow American, running for its survival in the face of tremendous odds. Trump is giving of himself and sacrificing himself so that his children and ours might have a future in the land that we all love, recognizing that it is in real peril and if this election is lost to the globalists so is this nation.Mr. Trump suffers personal ridicule and character assassination on our behalf that would cause lesser men to throw up their hands and walk away. He’s getting minimal support from the familiar establishment Judases who claim to be on his side, those who adorn themselves with a false mantle of conservatism as a means of deception. They are faces and names that are familiar, the traitors to this nation and the GOP, mouse-men like Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, John McCain, Mitt Romney and any Bush.A lesser man would have given up by now, and God knows we’ve got a federal government full of lesser-thans of that caliber for reference. Yet Donald Trump goes on, doggedly, unshakable in his determination to do what is right for this nation, to be the man that saves America at its most vulnerable moment.We are fortunate to have an exceptional candidate in Donald Trump; the best and only man who could and would truly represent us rather than merely provide lip service as he slides the knife into our backs. We cannot survive more of that establishment type of turncoat that now fills Congress, the executive branch and the judiciary. They are the familiar serpents that cannot be trusted and who cannot tell the truth, who have brought our nation to the brink of destruction; the type of evil personified by Hillary Clinton. This is not an election with two flawed candidates. This is an election with the worst of all candidates, one of the worst subhumans ever to draw a breath, facing off against a man of the caliber of a founding father, another Washington, Jefferson, Jackson or Reagan. We need to stop accepting the false proclamations of the lying media, stop allowing them to define the race in terms that suit their efforts to hide their candidate’s many flaws and our candidate’s extreme greatness.Donald Trump is the best of all candidates. He defeated 16 others who were all better choices than the woman he faces now. He is precisely the man America needs and we Americans need to become vocal in making that desperate need and our unwavering support known to everyone. We must recognize our good fortune and understand that the perfect candidate for the times is still not going to be a perfect man. There is no such thing. Finding the perfect leader to rescue us and our nation from certain destruction is all we can or should ask. The presidency is the toughest job in government. While Trump isn’t perfect, he’s close.

'Mumbai: In recent time, writing satires has become quite rewarding. First the jobless, worthless people found money to buy tea from a local tea stalls by writing these satires. Next, they have set their eyes on purchasing bungalows like Antilla. From 5 Rs credits, local vendors have started giving them credit worth 15 Rs. monthly. Their career path lays perfectly laid out in front of them.With so much money involved, it was bound to find some haters (These are the guys who still survive on the credit limit of Rs. 5, hence jealous) who would want to distract them.When they write an article on Modi, Bhakts fill up the comment boxes with abuses.When they write an article on Kejriwal, Aapians tear them apart, without any logic obviously.When they write an article on Congress, Congress’s come back saying facts can’t be presented as satires. Anyways leave them now.Frustrated that they can’t write on anyone famous, the association has decided to lend support to an independent candidate for the next PM elections. The reasons, when inquired about, was straightforward. She is the only one whose supporters even don’t mind for writing articles on her. you can go to any level, she has tolerance more than any politician/actor/industrialist. She should have been the role model for our audience.Its time India takes the next big step and choose Her as the next PM, so that our successful journey continues, and at least one of us can buy Antilla model from Chandni Chowk worth Rs. 100.',fake

'News reports and Tweets from Qaraqosh, Iraq, the largest Christian city in that country located near Mosul, all say “liberated,” but the simple truth is that the Islamic State was driven from the city last week by Christian soldiers.  The terrorist organization is still in the region, and in their wake, they leave behind a mess.This destruction is bad enough, though it is not total. Isis fighters set fire to many ordinary houses in addition to the churches in the days before they left, but – possibly because there was no furniture left to burn since it all had been looted – most of these houses look as if they could be made habitable after extensive repairs. It will take time because not only has the furniture gone, but cookers and fridges so, even if light fittings or taps are still in place, there is no water or electricity.28,000 people call Qaraqosh home.  40,000 fled to safer locales in Europe and Asia Minor.  As a result, there are still Christian in the region – largely Syriac Catholics, one of the eastern rites (most of the west uses the Latin Rite) – and the first thing they did was celebrate Mass in the Church of the Immaculate Conception for the first time in over two years.War still rages in the region, and not even fifty miles away, the battle is still being fought, thus giving credence to the insecurity of the residents.  In addition, they have a message for America on the eve of the election.IRAQI Christians will pray for Donald Trump’s election victory after they condemned US Government for “abandoning” them to the barbaric terror of Islamic State.The Christian community in the latest Iraqi town to be freed from ISIS have opened up about how they were terrorised at the hands of the twisted jihadi militants.The once-bustling Qaraqosh, which boasted of more than 50,000 Christian residents, was recaptured from the jihadis last week.Residents who stayed in the town have described how ISIS told every Christian to pay a massive tax, convert to Islam or face execution……Those who survived the terror have now voiced their outrage that President Obama refused to protect them when Iraq’s largest Christian city fell to ISIS more than two years ago.A man in the village said he hopes Donald Trump – a widely favoured candidate in the town – will bring a different approach to Iraqi Christians.He told the camera: “Obama has never helped the Christians. In fact, he despises them. In the last 26 months, he has shown he despises all of them.“But we have hope in the new president, Trump.”Let’s just hope the Deplorables who make up the monster vote can beat out the election rigging.For more images, and a video of the return of chant to the church that so obviously sustained heavy damage during the ISIS occupation of Christian lands, please visit the Gateway Pundit.',fake

'What is it with these second and third wave feminists who think that taking off their clothes makes their point for them? Amy Schumer, cousin or niece or some form of relative of New York Senator Chuck Schumer, has been taking off her clothes to make points for quite a while. Last year, she made a contribution to culture being Miss December on a calendar.  This week, she put her bare torso on Instagram in full support of Hillary Clinton for President. (See the actual unaltered photo here.)Using the hashtag #StrongerTogether, the little Jewess put a caption on her photo with language that is verboten on this family-friendly site.  Needless to say, many of us ladies have a simple message for little Miss Schumer and all the other women who think that nakedness is some sort of political statement.Yeah, it isn’t.  The human body in all of its forms is beautiful, sensual, and has its place in art and science, but in the world of politics, a lot more gets done when everyone keeps their clothes on.  Women like Schumer do not speak for the rest of us.  They do not seem to believe that women think with something other than their vaginas and ovaries.  Well, there are many of us out here on the fruited plain who DO NOT think with our lady parts, but our noggins.  They are useful for something other than sporting the newest hair style.Amy Schumer received a lot of heat lately. Earlier this week, she was accused of cultural appropriation for her parody of Beyonce’s “Formation.”She also sparked a massive walkout during a stand-up comedy show in Tampa where, after bashing Trump and his supporters, nearly 200 members of the audience booed and left the venue.I guess Amy was unaware that Tampa is Trump Country, as proven by the recent 20,000+ crowd that showed up to a rally on Monday night:Oops.  Maybe that’s why she’s looking for attention in all the wrong places.(Sorry for not including the original photo, but there are legit reasons why we can’t.)',fake
'Dear friends,We have decided to shut down The UnReal Times (URT) website. What was fondly referred to as India’s favourite satire and humour portal, mostly by those running the site, will post its last article on the 30th of November, 2016.Some of you may be surprised by this sudden announcement. Some may be asking ‘Why, URT, why?’ A handful of you may be sobbing inconsolably (Get a grip, Ashwin). The majority of you will in all likelihood go ‘Meh’ and turn to the Twitter timeline of arguably the better satirist, Arvind Kejriwal.Regardless of how you might react to this announcement, on behalf of all our writers, we would like to tell you folks that it has been a privilege entertaining you, making you smile and once in a while, making you go ‘Dawg, that’s deep’. For over five years we did this, and boy, did we have a ball! Through this platform, we met wonderful people and some extremely talented writers, who wrote for us week after week expecting nothing in return apart from the opportunity to be read, and the secret hope of a massive payday from BJP President Amit Shah for services rendered. (Okay, maybe the latter part was just us.)But now, it is time to move on.We have thought long and hard about how we’d break it to you; how we’d explain the ‘why’ of it. Somewhere, we feel that we are letting you down by not running this site anymore. For a brief moment, we were tempted to blame PM Modi’s demonetization for our decision, along with rising intolerance and Donald Trump’s election as US President. Thankfully, a sanctimonious Rajdeep Sardesai tweet popped up on our Twitter timeline exactly at that moment and the thought vanished from our minds as quickly as cash disappears from an ATM these days.Perhaps it’s better to describe what happened in our recent team meeting when we decided to list all our full time members…“Well, there’s me, for starters,” said Karthik, writing down his name on a sheet of paper painstakingly, drawing out the moment for as long as he could, while Ashwin nodded vigorously.“Then there is you,” he added, writing down Ashwin’s full name including his middle name below his own.“Right, right,” nodded Ashwin sagely.The two satirists then looked at each other for a few moments.“Uh,” said Karthik, turning to the paper again, “then there is Mark Zuckerpandian…”Ashwin fidgeted uncomfortably.“Um, but, uh, Karthik, he… uh… doesn’t exist,” he said. “He’s unreal… you know that… you were the one who made him up.”Karthik sighed deeply.“Yeah, I know.”Gallows humour aside, we want to express our heartfelt thanks to our incredible readers for the love and affection – you really are the reason why we came this far; our awesome columnists – you made URT what it is, and we are proud to have published your often hilarious, sometimes hard-hitting and always meaningful posts on this platform; the many politicians, journalists and other celebrities from all walks of life who have appreciated our work. We will always cherish the kind words you had for us. Special thanks to Dr. Subramanian Swamy for his very generous praise on several occasions and to Dr. Bibek Debroy for supporting us and sharing our work from the very beginning.It may be curtains for the website, but we will continue to write humour, perhaps more than ever. We plan to come out with books and short stories a lot more frequently. We’ll also be active on Twitter and Facebook, sometimes to badger you to buy our books (Please don’t mute us!), but mostly to entertain you with our headlines, FB snippets and comics.To conclude this letter, allow us to quote the great Ravi Shastri: Ladies and gentlemen, we have had a fabulous 5 years. Over 100 writers participated, over 4000 articles were written, and it can only be said that in the end, the game of satire is the real winner!Best, Team URT.PS: If you really want to know why we are shutting down, READ OUR BOOK! (Sorry, couldn’t resist!)',fake
'Anonymous says they have some information that, if it’s true, puts a whole different light on the Donald Trump video, one that they feel may spell the end for Hillary Clinton. We can hope they’re right.According to a video that Anonymous just released, they believe that the tape that is supposedly the actual recordings of Trump on a bus, out of view and with no video of the actual offensive comments being spoken, is a forgery. What’s even more earth-shattering is their belief that Trump is aware that it is forged, and is prepared to confront Clinton with the evidence on stage during the Sunday debates.Mr. Trump’s mannerisms to many of us who watched the video, once he got off of the bus, were a little inconsistent with the comments made but it’s possible he could have been putting on a good face. In light of his admission that he had said what was claimed, there was no need to question either that or the fact that the recordings were made out of view. Those questions may have now been asked and answered.Anonymous asked themselves why this information didn’t come out during the Republican primary, as millions of dollars were expended in opposition research at that time as  well and everybody was targeting Donald Trump.They believe the same firm that created fake al-Qaeda videos in the past is responsible for the forgery, the UK’s Bell Pottinger. They note that the fact that the incident that is portrayed in the video is over ten years old means that the people involved won’t have a clear recollection of what was said. “This creates an opening for the operators to go in and enhance the audio,” said anonymous. “We spoke with someone who does sound engineering and has been involved in high profile court cases where recorded sound has been used in evidence.”He told anonymous that it wouldn’t be that hard to create a fake tape of a sound recording that old. You find some similar voices, sample them and alter them to match. Changing a few words would be easy, adding a few sentences would be harder but still could be done. “For that you have to match the cadence and depths,” he said, “but you could do it.” He cites an example, “If you wanted to change shoulder to pussy that would be easy.”The sound expert also raised an issue with the sound of the tic tacs and the ability to pick them up on the microphone. There is a strong likelihood that the sounds were added after the fact, by enhancement.Anonymous quotes what they identify as “a contact close to Trump,” who said, “Yes, there’s a lot of calls, a lot of fallout. Trump was asked to apologize immediately and he’s a team player so he did. But the core team is also very calm. They’re telling everyone to just wait for tomorrow night. This is sure to come up and they are just ready. They’re aching for it.”He continues, “What we think is that they don’t just have a response but rather it’s a trap for Clinton. Trump moved immediately and called some of his guys, his investigative team that went after the birth certificate; good guys, very pro.” Trump had a copy of the tape rush delivered to a recording studio.“Now they’re huddling,” says anonymous, “but they’re saying to everyone ‘keep calm. Stay the course one more day. Just wait for the question and boom.’ I don’t know for sure what they’ve got but they seem to think this race is over and not for Trump.Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'Bollywood director Anurag Kashyap, who tore into PM Modi over the theatre owners association’s decision to boycott screening films with Pakistani artistes in them, is at again.Serving a volley of angry tweets to the PM, Kashyap thundered, “@narendramodi Time for you to apologize again sir. My Samsung Galaxy Note 7 just exploded this morning. Why are you doing this to me? You also use a smartphone and haven’t had any problems. Why is it us who are always on the receiving end? As if it wasn’t enough that Lunchbox didn’t win the Oscar, or the Nobel. BTW, Bharat Mata ki Jai.”Kashyap’s rant drew instant praise from Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal. “Proud of u fellow AK. Today it is a Samsung phone. Tomorrow it’ll be the entire country if this psycopath has his way,” the AAP chief claimed.AAP spokesperson The Ashutosh too, spoke up in support of the director. “Hats off to the Cashyup’s cowrage! Will the Modi answer?” the former IBN7 editor tweeted.While the BJP leadership is yet to respond to Kashyap’s second rant, it’s media-nominated spokesperson, the VHP’s Sadhvi Prachi asked Kashyap to go to Pakistan if he didn’t want his phone to explode. “Everything else around him will, though,” the Sadhvi stated.Sports Minister Vijay Goel stated that he’d like a selfie with Kashyap before responding to him.BJP MP Shatrugan Sinha spoke in favor of his Bollywood colleague, stating that there was nothing wrong in asking questions to the PM, but that it won’t do any harm if the PM responded. “To the best of my knowledge, I’ve not told Modi Bhai KHAMOSH! So I see no reason why he shouldn’t speak up,” the Shotgun stated.',fake
'In an announcement which has shocked workers and family members of the Samajwadi party, when their senior most leader Mulayam Singh Yadav said, “Anyone from the Yadav family, who can understand clearly each and every word that I speak will be unanimously appointed as the next UP Chief Minister.”Mulayam Singh came to this decision after he realized that 90\% of the party members nod blankly to his speeches and instructions without understanding a single word that he speaks.“It all started when Netaji realized that he always gave the same instructions to Shivpal, Akhilesh and Ram Gopal Yadav but they were understood differently by each of them each time. However all three of them would nod as if they had understood the same thing,” said a senior party member close to Mulayam Singh. “Obviously I myself don’t get half of his sentences, but I have become good at reading his lip movements,” he added.This is not the first time Mulayam Singh has been informed of it. As many as three decades ago, school teachers of Akhilesh Yadav had told Mulayam Singh that his son doesn’t listen to his father. While Mulayam mistook it for Akhilesh being a disobedient child, what the teachers actually meant was that Akhilesh hardly understands what his father speaks.According to sources, Mulayam Singh is currently conducting a test among family members to determine who comes closest in understanding his speech in order to accordingly finalize party positions.“To K!$@#$ Communal $Q#$ Q# \%@bey @# #$$!@$ #$@#$@ Secular G#$#$\%# @# UP, B bil #$Q$ $#$@#$$ Congrss P#!!$ #$@$ #$@ ByeP d#@# #$@$ erection,” said a family member when asked to repeat what Netaji said.More than half of the family members couldn’t come even remotely close. It was only Akhilesh and Shivpal Yadav who could clearly identify some of the key words from the sentence, which were ‘communal’, ‘secular’, ‘election’, ‘UP’ and ‘Congress’.Later, confusion turned to consternation when an outsider by name Amar Singh heard this family conversation and clearly recited what Netaji said, which was: “To keep Communal forces away and have a secular Government in UP, we will tie up with Congress party and not with BJP during next elections.”While Mulayam lauded Amar for the translation, Akhilesh got seriously pissed by the fact that a family conversation was heard by an outsider surreptitiously and launched into an emotional speech to his supporters.(The writer is the author of the book, ‘The Bogus Read’)',fake

'Arnab Goswami’s security personnel made an explosive start to their duty to protect the popular journalist as they took down one of the ‘The Newshour’ panellists, fearing a provocation from the loud participant.A part of the Y category security cover to the journalist, the guard who leaped on the panellist was on alert mode from the start of the prime-time show. Hiding right behind Arnab, the guard anticipated something would happen when the noisy panellist started yelling at the host.“Mr. Kulkarni, please don’t yell at me! I can hear you…you’re sitting right next to me,” Arnab tried to pacify the panellist.That was the first warning sign for Arnab’s personal security guard.“Mr. Kulkarni, please don’t shout. I said, I am coming to you…”“No, I am coming to you!” the security personnel behind Arnab cut him short before pouncing on the panellist.As the noisy panellist was taken down by the feisty bodyguard, Arnab admonished him, “Please don’t behave this way with my guests. If you have a point to make, please get miked up.”The security personnel didn’t stop there. There was another errant participant who tried to bully Arnab during the show using provocative language.The Newshour host rebuked the panellist, asking him not to misbehave. But the participant wouldn’t budge.“Remove the mike and leave the show now!” Arnab, losing his temper, finally told the participant.Sensing that the multiple reprimands didn’t work on the panellist, the guard again swung into action, this time scooping the participant in his arms and escorting him out of the show.Following the anchor like a shadow, 24×7, the security personnel have been on their toes from day one of their duty.One day, hearing a lot of yelling from Arnab’s changing room, one of the personnel barged in, breaking the door.Arnab, the lone person in the room, threw his hands up, “Hey dude, relax! I am just practising my lines for tonight’s show.”It’s been observed that many panellists now prefer to attend Arnab’s show via video conferencing from their homes than visiting the studio as they fear they might be subjected to not just verbal assaults from the anchor, but also physical attacks by his guards in case they slip up.(Originally published on Right to Laughter)',fake
'Delhi Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal who has off late come a under lot of pressure on the crumbling state of the Indian capital due to severe air pollution has promised his critics to clean up the air in the capital once he is elected as the prime minister of India. The AAP supremo claims that an imandar sarkar at the center will ensure that the future Delhi state government gets in line thereby making Delhi a smog free city.“Doston, the center is not allowing the state to function and that’s why I need to become the PM to perform the duties of the CM. Once I become the PM of India, I’ll have all the power to rule the capital and so, besides cleaning its air, several new flyovers would be made, there would be no traffic jams, 15 lakh CCTVs would be installed, free Wi-Fi will be provided for all, new DTC buses would be inducted, Yamuna would cleaned and most importantly Delhi would attain full statehood,” said Kejriwal.“Even corrupt Sheila ji could clean Delhi’s air significantly by decongesting Delhi through flyovers and metro and it was only possible because she had support from the corrupt center. Corrupt-Corrupt mil ke kaam kar lete they [Corrupt and corrupt worked together]. Once I become the PM, I will give all the support to the city just like the old times,” he added, while speaking at a press conference wearing a gas mask.On a question regarding state and center relations, Kejriwal said, “Aisa bhi ho sakta hai [It might happen] that the future Delhi CM might not cooperate, but since we will be honest and strict, we will get the CM in line and make him perform all that we are not able to do now. In short I would not be a weak PM like Modiji,” said Kejriwal, and added, “And if the situation gets really bad, I can get Delhi under the center. And in the worst case scenario, I’ll become Delhi’s CM again. Whatever the case may be, I’ll ensure that Delhi becomes a clean and green city.”AAP leaders have unanimously supported Arvind’s view point and claimed that they too need central ministry positions to solve all the problems of Delhi.“If you want to fix the Delhi once and for all, the first step would be to help Kajariwal win the Punjab election and make him its CM. Once that is done we will take the next step and win the UP election and Kajariwal will be its CM also. Everyone knows that the party who wins the UP bags the center and thus by the 2019 he will become the prime minister of India to solve all the problems of Delhi state including air pollusion,” said AAP stalwart, Ashutosh.(DMAN aka Divyamaan is the author of the spoof book ‘The Bogus Read’)',fake
'In a completely unsurprising development, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has now stopped drinking water, accusing Hydrogen and Oxygen of being in a conspiracy. “Sab mile hue hain ji!” he hollered, adjusting the flowers in his hair.A distraught Mrs. Kejriwal was heard telling her friend, “He’s long stopped drinking tea because of Modi and now with this new water-phobia, I’m worried he’ll dehydrate. He’s already showing the signs. His coughing has become dry and his index-finger has swollen up.”“I took him to my uncle who is a renowned homeopath, but there too, without any provocation, my husband pointed his finger at my elderly uncle and called him a psychopath! I’ve never seen Uncle ji so upset. Hai Ram… Ab main kya karoon?” she wailed.Meanwhile, in a show of support, senior party-members Ashutosh and Sisodiya have taken to drinking their whiskies neat.“Will the Modi answer why his agents Haider-jan and Oksi-jan are conspiring against the Kajariwal?” tweeted The Ashutosh.',fake
'Mumbai. The honorable Supreme Court’s order that Dahi Handi pyramid will have height restriction of 20 feet, proved costly for the medium pace bowler Ashok Dinda when he  mistakenly broke the Dahi Handi of his society while bowling in a gully cricket match.Ashok Dinda is famous for the massive jumps and leaps he take while delivering a ball. He has always been at top position during his bowling career, his normal bowling style is Right arm over the wicket, 2ndfloor pavilion end.Dahi Handi last came in news when the Supreme Court in 2016 put the restriction on the height of Dahi Handi pyramid seeing the casualties happened due to it. However Supreme Court’s order was challenged by a Mumbai based Krida Mandal. Since, the courts and citizens are not sure whether it’s a ritual or a sport no decision has been taken yet.   Ashok Dinda, an Indian cricketer, and usually a part of the bottom most teams of IPL table, got into a trouble while playing cricket in his society. Though it was gully cricket match, but Dinda being a professional cricket was all serious and started bowling in his own style. While taking run up, he jumped and accidentally touched the Dahi Handi of the society. Second time he did it with much more strength and not just touched the Dahi Handi but broke it unknowingly. Society president filed an FIR against Ashok Dinda later.It’s not the first time when Ashok Dinda has achieved something accidentally. Once trying to skip a pothole in Mumbai, Ashok Dinda jumped higher than usual and made the world record beating the then existing 2.45 m record.  Whether Dahi Handi is a ritual or a sport is yet to be decided but the Supreme Court’s order to restrict the height of pyramid to 20 feet is for the safety of the participants and should be looked above the religion.',fake
'Delhi police has foiled a suicide attempt by Aam Aadmi Party spokesperson Ashutosh during a protest rally organized by his party. He was apprehended when he and his team were proofreading his suicide note before attempting suicide.He was later sent to 14 days judicial custody where he is currently undergoing a refresher course in grammar and spelling.The incident happened yesterday when AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal organized an impromptu protest rally at Jantar Mantar to expose Narendra Modi, but unfortunately no one from the media turned up for the event. Crestfallen, Mr. Kejriwal decided to go back on Twitter and continue his service for his constituency when an idea crossed his mind. He shared the idea with Ashutosh and urged him to commit suicide.“But this is not what I was looking forward to when I joined AAP,” retorted Ashutosh.“No, you are not going to die. You will just attempt a suicide. We will call media to cover the event. Just imagine, you will be making headlines, you will be trending on Twitter, everyone will be talking about you. It will be so cool!”“Ok, you do it then if it’s so cool.”“No, I need to oversee the whole event. See, there are two options for you, either do it or find another party.”‘‘Which party will take me if I leave AAP?’ he pondered for a while and said, “Ok, let’s do it.”“Cool, now write a suicide note and let’s get on with this.”“Ok.”AAP party workers gathered around Ashutosh as he typed the opening line on Microsoft Word that read, “I holed Modi resoncible for my deth…”A crack team of 5 proof readers was formed immediately, who advised him about the correction the sentence demanded.He grinned and typed, “sorry responcible …not resoncible ..”“No, you can just delete the words and…”Another 5 proof readers were hired urgently to strengthen the team as he continued to type the letter.By the time he completed the letter, the language settings on MS Word had automatically turned into Spanish.“Done,” Ashutosh pronounced with a satisfactory smile as he beheld his creation for a few seconds before calling police to inform them about his plan.“Sir wait, we haven’t started proofreading yet,” implored one of the newly hired proofreaders.“Do you want me to die for real or what?”“No but at least the attempt should look genuine and not a hoax.”“Don’t worry, I’ve informed Darya Ganj Police Station. By the time they beat the traffic to reach here, we will not only complete the proofreading but will also complete the suicide…attempt.”3 proofreaders immediately started to decode the message in the letter in a separate document, another 3 changed the language settings of MS Word, and the rest started deleting the word ‘why’ which he had added at the end of every sentence. But it was too much of an ask for 10 mortals and they couldn’t even rewrite half of the letter when police arrived at the scene.Kejriwal tried to cover up the whole mess and handed over the letter to the police inspector, saying, “See, what Modi has done to him! He was about to commit suicide.”The inspector held the suicide note in front of him and mumbled, “Oh, Ashutosh. We would need some help here.”Experts, including the ones who decoded Nostradamus’s predictions, were flown in from various parts of the world to decipher the message in the letter, however, they haven’t quite succeeded in their endeavor as reports last came in.',fake
'It’s one of the psy-ops operations that never seems to get any coverage. Unlike polls that are “scientific” with “methodology” that is more closely guarded than the nuclear missile codes and are designed to make it seem like one side is winning when it isn’t, online trolls and astroturf “support” for any one candidate is a little hard to pin down.  We all know how it works.  Keyboard commandos sit behind the comfort of their flat screens, create fake accounts since most of social media is free, trash one candidate or another, and get paid for the effort.In the conservative website world of the internet, we’ve seen this for a couple decades.  Anyone who spent any amount of time on Free Republic back in the day and remembers ZOT! and the Viking Kitties knows about trolls.In 2016, though, the online army working to create the impression that Hillary Clinton’s support is a lot wider and deeper than it really is got a bit cocky and other users got suspicious.Savvy Reddit users outed one of the Clinton staffers, Adam Parkhomenko, her director of grassroots engagement, who was apparently posting anonymously on the site threatening Trump supporters. Under the username rcMI9HXF, he wrote, “Warning- participation in this slanderous witch hunt will result in legal action.  Mrs. Clinton has been made aware of your childish attempt to slander her and her supporters.  There will be consequences for your actions.” When Reddit users guessed he was being paid by Clinton, he responded, “I am just an average Joe fed up with the blatant lies you people are slinging towards HRC. I’m a Bush supporter and volunteer, actually.” But when they discovered his home address, he finally admitted his real identity, “You can call me Adam. My buddies call me A.park.”This is but one effort of the astro-turf army that has been outed by users and admins at various liberal and progressive sites, actually.  This year, they aren’t just going after the conservatives, and the reporting on it is spreading to liberal bastions such as the Atlantic.  The Daily Kos outed more than one troll claiming to have switched from Bernie Sanders to Hillary.  Media Matters, a David Brock operation, has even been attacked.This is not a new tactic for the Clinton people.  They have been trolling online for years, even developing websites that appear to support one candidate when they are really there to troll for Clinton.  This happened with the “Feel the Bern” website and a site called Bill for First Lady.  The code for these efforts was found on the accounts of the astroturf trolls.The anonymous fake accounts come are nothing new for Clinton. In 2007, paid campaign staffers and volunteers on her campaign were caught creating anonymous accounts to artificially inflate her support. The influential Blue Hampshire blog discovered the ruse, when several anonymous accounts were all created in succession on the site from the same Clinton campaign IP address, which then bolstered pro-Clinton diaries.Clinton hired a campaign manager this election cycle known for his scorched earth tactics. Robby Mook started a listserv in 2009 known as “Mook’s Mafia” to share political information with associates. He says things like “smite Republicans mafia-style” and “F U Republicans. Mafia till I die.” He has also said, “First, the mafia never separates, it just continues to grow and expand and move into other states in order to destroy Republicans.” By choosing Mook, Clinton reveals the type of campaign she wants, Alinskyite tactics of do anything to win.Which, according to some of the trolls’ friends, is being under utilized this campaign season.  Other parts of the Clinton campaign are spending millions to employ an astroturf army of keyboard commandos.  One of the pros mentioned above is sort of sitting idle.  (Outed too many times?)  It sounds like the campaign learned its lesson that on the internet, everything can be traced.  In that, all trolls are in danger of being outed at some point or another.',fake
'Are Dhoop sticks to be banned? Even after banning celebrations of Diwali in the NCR, the smog is back strong, leaving new challenges for the delhi administration and the supreme court. It was heard that a new suite to ban Dhoop sticks burnt in the household is in preparation, which could be produced in the court once the current smog is cleared.Taking to our news anchor, inside the clean air chamber, the lawyer whose name is not be spoken, smoking his cigar stated that, “The problem with the pollution is mainly because of Choolhas and the Dhoop sticks or Agarbathis which are burned in the festivals and offerings. However Choolhas are secondary in choice because of political interest, Dhoop sticks are priority to be banned. They can use the room fresheners instead of Dhoop sticks, saving the environment”.On asking how confident they are about this, the lawyer responded, “After our win on cracking crackers out of Delhi, we are very confident that we are going to win this decision too.”So, after the great ban on Diwali festival, Delhiites now need to be ready to throw out Dhoop sticks out of their house once they hear from the supreme court.Stay tuned for more such news.',fake

'Dinesh Chandimal-led Sri Lanka are on the brink of a series whitewash in the third and final Test against India commencing on August 12. So far in the series, injury-stricken Sri Lanka have failed to tick the right boxes. India has been totally dominant in the series and now they feel that this series was a complete waste for them. Instead they could have scheduled a series with a stronger team.BCCI has been criticized for organizing such series when the Indian team is number one in tests and should compete with the stronger teams. The only people watching the India Lanka series are the people who don’t have jobs or are not interested in searching a job for themselves. One such fan Mr. Sanil Jain spoke to our Faking News reporter and he had this to say,” Look, there are so many advantages in watching the Ind-SL series. Some days back I was finding it hard to get proper sleep. That is when the doctor prescribed the Ind-SL series, and now am able to sleep for hours and hours. Also, after coming  to know that I am a regular watcher of the Ind-Sl series, no relatives make plan to visit me any time soon. What more can I ask from God. I Hope the BCCI keeps on organizing such series in future also.”BCCI meanwhile did call a press conference to clarify that it was indeed a brain fade moment for them when they were scheduling this series. They have also promised that they will not repeat such mistakes and be extra cautious while planning future tours to cricketing nations. Government meanwhile has decided to use the viewership data of the ongoing series to calculate the unemployment figures for the last two months.',fake
'It’s been six weeks since the hunt for the coach began after the fall out between Kohli and Kumble that saw the latter withdrawing from the race, and every passing day has produced twists, turns, controversies, melodrama. Complications arose as the CAC also appointed in the form of ‘consultants’ for batting (Rahul Dravid) and bowling (Zaheer Khan), which did not seem to sit well with Shastri. Now to manage all this chaos, BCCI has decided that it will hire a consultant who will choose which consultant should accompany the team on its overseas tours.BCCI has finally woke up and taken note of the chaos surrounding its processes and a consultant will surely bring back some much needed sanity in the cricketing environment. The selection process for the consultants will be quite simple. The candidates will be interviewed by a panel of 3 consultants who will ask them their views on providing consultancy to the team during the tough overseas tours. The only thing which is not cleared yet is the process to select the panel of consultants who will choose the consultant who in turn will choose the consultant for the tour. According to BCCI sources, it is not as difficult as it seems and the process will likely get over in 1 year time.Journalists, cricket fans and the cricketers themselves have approved of this decision by the BCCI and can now hope for the team performing exceedingly well on tours of England, SA and Aus. Till the time the consultant is hired, Ravi Shastri has decided to invite Sachin to give batting tips to the team. Ravi spoke to the faking news team and had this to say,” See I know for fact that Sachin doesn’t visit Rajya Sabha and has ample time on his hand as now he doesn’t have to promote his movie also. So this is the right time for him to join us and take Indian cricket to newer heights.”',fake
'Dr. Ben Carson gets it just as Donald Trump gets it, there is a sense of urgency to the situation the United States finds itself in. The wrong decision by the people of this nation on November 8th in supporting more of the same will be our undoing.Dr. Carson responded to the Gettysburg Address of Donald Trump saying, “I think he knows that we’re down to the Crux now, and really, I’m glad he’s beginning to talk this way, because as I’ve said for a long period of time, this election is not about Democrats versus Republicans. This election is about the status quo, the political class versus we, the people.”Carson continues, “And it will make all the difference in the world in terms of what happens to our children and our grandchildren and the country from now on. If you look at the platforms and the policies of these two candidates, they go off in starkly different directions. And I think one of the reasons that the group that doesn’t want to talk about the issues spends all of this time creating distractions is because they want to make sure that the people don’t know that we have a possibility of going off in a deeply different direction than the founders of this nation intended.”  “Or that anybody actually thinks that we’re going off into,” says Dr. Carson, “and they’ll be there and they’ll say ‘how did we get here?’ And then somebody will come back and say, ‘Well, nobody paid attention to what was going on at that election.”Dr. Carson believes that Trump’s contract with the American voter will help tremendously, saying he has great faith in the wisdom of the American people. I do not believe that they are as simplistic as many people in the political class think they are, and the media think they are. They think they can be so easily manipulated, I think many people take offense at that. And when you look at the crowds and the enthusiasm for Trump versus Clinton, that’s telling you something. And that’s really the reason they’re coming out with all of this fire, because they’re seeing it too. And they’re trying to use psychological warfare.”Carson reminds the audience that Thomas Jefferson predicted that when we were on the verge of this nation turning into something else, the wisdom of the people would recognize it and correct course.Dr. Carson doesn’t think things are going to work out for the anti-American Clinton Democrats. He sees a Trump victory in November if the people will simply wake up and think for themselves, not listening to the spin of the media that clearly has an agenda. ',fake
'Just when we all thought the bombshells were starting to taper off, Wikileaks continued to release emails hacked from John Podesta’s gmail account.  For conservatives, this is Christmas come early.  For Democrats, all the skeletons are just falling out of the closet.One of those skeletons involves the Special Committee on Benghazi and the emails that they were due to receive.  At the time of the writing of this note, March 17, 2015, it seemed that the Hillary Clinton team, including her lawyer David Kendall, was hell bent on keeping the infamous 55,000 emails from Trey Gowdy.From David Kendall regarding the extension granted to get the emails to the committee:Right, we requested and got a two week extension of the original return date (March 13). We should not say State HAS turned over all that the Committee has asked for, just that we’ve requested State to do this.The response by Philippe Reines in Hillary’s office:To be clear, there are and will likely remain only two parties who can release the full 55k: State and us. Nobody else will have them. Gowdy will only end up with what’s relevant to his committee, which won’t grow that much beyond what he has. Probably not get anywhere close to 500.Knowing how the internet actually works, this writer won’t touch that bit of hubris other than to say, um, never underestimate an attack dog with a bone.  That’s sort of what Trey Gowdy was when it came to the email issue.  The people named on the email chain conspired not to turn over requested evidence.  Jill Stein, actually, had it right on a tweet last night.Evidence is the least of it.  What we really need is an Attorney General who has not been threatened, and an FBI director not on the take.  We Americans aren’t stupid.  We know what happened.  And no, we DO NOT approve.',fake
'It’s the story that only Fox News seems to be covering with any sort of intensity.  Marc Turi, a licensed arms dealer who created the scheme to arm Libyan rebels around UN sanctions in 2011, was set up to take the fall for the Benghazi disaster as well as the end result of the arming of the Libyan Transitional Government – those weapons ended up in Syria, among other places – and the Obama Administration ultimately let him go.  Why?  Because his testimony, and the classified statements of CIA personnel put the blame for all of it squarely on the shoulders of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The Obama Administration dropped the charges against Turi to protect her.Dizzy yet?  Hang on.The story begins in 2011 when Libyian officials started to defect from Mouamar Gaddaffi’s regime.  In order for the U.S. to arm the rebels, weapons had to go through other countries.  In this case, specifically, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates were used as the conduits.  According to Turi, the Clinton State Department used the plan, “Operation Zero Footprint”, but not him.  Instead, Mrs. Clinton used her own people to do the gun running.  And that, Turi claims, is how the weapons escaped and ended up in the hands of entities related to the Muslim Brotherhood.  (Conservative Treehouse has a long explanation of how it all went down.)As of early 2012, the Clinton State Department did have an effort underway to find and buy back the weapons, but by then the genie was out of the bottle and U.S. military forces were seeing weapons made in America shooting at them.In February of 2012 Asst. Secretary of State Andrew Shapiro admitted the State Department had been attempting to relocate and buy-back those weapons since August of 2011. However, on September 11th 2012, while those efforts were still ongoing, the attacks in Benghazi against the U.S. State Department Ambassador Chris Stevens took place, and four Americans were killed.Two years later, the Obama Department of Justice charged Marc Turi, the architect of the plan that was taken from him and then failed, with “non-registered weapons shipments.”  He was set up to take the fall.Turi’s defense was that the weapons were unregistered because the State Department and the CIA needed covert cover. Elements within the CIA confirmed the basic outline for Turi’s assertion.In 2015 Turi provided Fox News with documents and email exchanges he had with high-level members of Congress as well as military, and State Department employees to back up his claim that the Obama administration authorized in 2011, at the height of the Arab Spring, a covert weapons program that spun out of control.Marc Turi’s legal defense team said if the DOJ was going to prosecute him for the arms shipments, his defense would necessarily reveal how Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was actually the driver of the entire program.And that is why Marc Turi is now walking free despite being ruined by the Obama Administration.  His story is the one that the Special Committee on Benghazi is looking for for background on why Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other men died in Benghazi, Libya in September 11, 2012.  His gun running program was being directed by Hillary Clinton and her people.The DOJ tried to claim “national security” issues and keep the aspects relating to the U.S. State Department and Secretary Clinton under wraps during the pre-trial motions. However, a federal judge ruled a few days ago the defense was allowed to use the documented evidence Turi possessed to defend himself.The case was slated to begin trial on November 8th, the same day as the U.S. presidential election.As a direct consequence of that ruling, the DOJ announced last week they were dropping all the charges.And yet only Fox News is carrying the story, the one that answers so many questions, and ties up a lot of loose ends in the Hillary Clinton scandal machine.  At least as it pertains to Benghazi.',fake

'Hillary Clinton flubbed her line about fact checking trump, maybe the medication is set just a little off, telling the debate audience first they need to fat check him. That won’t be necessary and neither will fact checking on his statements.She makes a sales pitch for her website, encouraging those who need to be told what to think to go to her propaganda dissemination site and see what kind of spin they are putting on everything. She says they had millions fact-checking at the last debate and expects a repeat of the same this time around.She goes on to say that “It’s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.” Trump responded immediately, as if he’d been handed the line,  “Because you’d be in jail.”The audience went into an uproarious laughter at the comeback that she walked into. Clinton sat down like a fighter saved by the bell.Anderson Cooper went further to try to diminish the impact of the punch, saying, “We want to remind the audience to please not uh… talk out loud please do not applaud. You’re just wasting time.”It was a desperate to protect his candidate both by reducing the magnitude of that response but also of any future zingers that Mr. Trump might deliver through the course of the evening. The words for “Please, you’re making Hillary look like the criminal she is” seem to have escaped him.It was definitely one of the best lines of the night, maybe of the entire campaign.Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake

'The poll was conducted after the announcement on Friday by FBI Director James Comey that the agency was going to be re-examining  emails that might be related to Hillary’s email server. It surveyed 659 people who had already voted or are likely to vote Nov. 8.Almost a third of respondents in the WRAL News poll ranked trustworthiness as the most important consideration in voting for president. Positions on issues were rated most important by 40 percent, while experience and character were far behind at 17 and 8 percent, respectively.WRAL reports: Of those ranking trustworthiness most important, 83 percent favor Trump. He also wins among those most concerned about issues, 52 to 43 percent. Clinton was favored by 93 percent of those most concerned with experience, and she doubled up Trump among voters concerned about character, 58 to 26 percent.Breaking down the results, Trump has flipped the gender gap in recent weeks, cutting Clinton’s 12-point lead among women down to 7 points while widening his dominance among male voters from 9 points to 23 points. He also has erased her lead among voters 50 and older, moving from a 5-point deficit to an 11-point advantage, while maintaining his slight lead among voters ages 18 to 49. 3Clinton’s sizable lead in North Carolina’s metro areas also has eroded since early October. Her 64 to 27 percent lead among urban voters three weeks ago is down to 53 to 43 percent, and her 9-point lead in the suburbs is now a 2-point deficit.

'Excerpts from the Clinton Chronicles highlights the drug abuse and its use as a tool for the manipulation of people, particularly young girls, many underage, by Bill Clinton and his inner circle.Doc DeLaughter, a former Arkansas Police Investigator, describes the case against Dan Lasater. There was heavy drug use and other offenses related to their criminal activity, which included extensive sexual activity with young girls. Cocaine was used to obtain sexual favors and in conducting business.Former Clinton insider Larry Nichols describes Dan Lasater as Bill’s best friend, who went to prison with his brother Roger, and gave cocaine away in order to influence and manipulate people. Nichols describes Lasater as having a “huge pile” of cocaine in his office, “ashtray upon ashtray” full of cocaine at parties, which they gave to young girls.Nichols says, “That sick, they were giving a highly addictive drug to young girls.”DeLaughter recalls one girl who was a 14-year-old cheerleader out of North Little Rock, AR. She was sent to a physician friend of Clinton’s for birth control pills at that age. He indicates that they used cocaine to manipulate the girl and that she ended up losing her virginity. He said the last he heard of the young woman she was working at Lake Tahoe as a prostitute.This is the kind of “man” Bill Clinton is, but we’ll never hear about it on mainstream media. Bill Clinton is a rapist, as they say, with increasing frequency at the small, intimate gatherings he frequents today, what they like to pretend are campaign rallies, minus any rallying. A truth that isn’t reported is still the truth. What has been suppressed for many years is finally starting to find its way out.

'One of the checks that Desai had to deliver was a personal gift to Bill Clinton from the government of Qatar, the terrorist-friendly nation to where the Gitmo terrorists supposedly traded for Bowe Bergdahl were released. They’re no longer under custody, their remaining sentence was shortened to one year. Obama says they’re rehabilitated though, so it’s not a concern.Qatar thinks highly of Bill Clinton, with rape not carrying the stigma for the offender in Islamic nations that it does for non-Clintons in the US and elsewhere. In fact, in Qatar it is legal for a man to rape his wife. Bill’s a good old standard redneck and to show how much they value his friendship, the Qatari King gave him a million bucks. It had nothing to do with his wife being Secretary of State at the time, in April of 2012.The information about the gift to Bill comes from the wealth of documents provided by WikiLeaks, in an email from Desai to four different Clinton Foundation employees. As Desai was informing the recipients in the email that he had the check for Bill, he also made them aware that the Qataris were looking for “investments” in Haiti, or scams as they might otherwise known.The overly generous amount may seem strange but it’s important to remember that he is one third of the Clinton in Clinton Foundation. Another third, his wife Hillary, had the ability to look the other way when terrorist groups and their supporters appeared on the State Department radar. With just the right kind of motivation everybody wins.It was a couple of years after this birthday gift was awarded that ISIS made their breakout run across Iraq and Syria. It would have taken about that much time to equip and train a terrorist army and to set up the logistics, recruitment, and communication capability, all of the startup headaches associated with a fledgling terrorist state.The last thing the Saudis or Qataris would want is the US condemning their new joint terrorist endeavor. We know that Hillary Clinton and those receiving intelligence briefings were aware of the ISIS creation and growth so perhaps this gesture of good will helped to ease their concerns that ISIS might somehow become a barbaric, fundamental Islamic, anti-human rights paramilitary force. That makes a lot more sense than the story given at the time by the Clinton operative, particularly since the email was dated April 16th and Clinton’s birthday is August 19th.The birthday seems like a convenient excuse, and a particularly lame one, for the sale of State Department approval of their terrorist organization. That would explain how ISIS was able to travel across open desert without being annihilated and why they were allowed to operate, pump oil and grow without the necessary force being directed to stop them.It reeks of pay for play but that’s nothing unusual for the Clintons. Nobody gives million dollar birthday gifts without expecting a million dollar favor in return.

'Bill Clinton isn’t finished insulting the Americans who support Donald Trump, Hillary labeled us a basket of deplorable’s, whom she went on to declare to be unredeemable. We’re looked down upon by the criminal elites who believe they are better than us because we aren’t are too backwards to be willing to pillage our nation as a means to achieving wealth. We’re not willing to sell out our children’s future and our fellow citizens’ present in the interest of obtaining high dollar foreign bribes or simply just reckless endangerment through insufficient or nonexistent security measures. We’re deplorable.Hillary Clinton demeaned us as being on whole a collection of “racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, and Islamaphobic” Neanderthals. They were comments that Mr. Trump labeled as showing “her true contempt for everyday Americans.”But her husband, Bill Clinton the rapist, has plenty of contempt of his own for the patriotic Americans standing between them and eight more years of unbridled plunder. His “howdy, aw shucks, golly, this is gonna hurt you more than it hurts me” shtick is growing a little tiresome and has lost any effect at diffusing or defecting away from his Bubba the Rapist President persona. Clinton tells us he’s just a good old country boy from rural Arkansas who happens to like having sex with unwilling partners. Everybody needs a hobby. We can’t hold it against him nor should we fault his wife for intimidating, harassing and threatening his victims into silence. That’s just the Clintons being the Clintons, after all.His three accusers at the debate helped focus attention on the crimes of the former president. Likewise the rash of protesters shouting “Bill Clinton is a Rapist” at their notoriously low turnout events where the speaker is easily distracted has contributed to the discussion, in spite of the mainstream propagandists’ best efforts to cover it up.Good old Biting Bill, who bloodied Juanita Broaddrick’s lip by biting on it excessively in the excitement of the rape, had a few more words to say in expressing his hatred for the patriots of America obstructing his path to riches. He knows who they are, and it’s nobody. They’re not like him, he rose above them and became important, but he still remembers what the Trump supporters are like from growing up in their “wretchedness.”He told his small audience, as if he were the candidate and not his wife, “Look man, the other guy’s base is what I grew up in. You know I’m basically your standard redneck.” Clinton is wrong, either deliberately or by mistake. He may have been able to claim that moral high ground of being a redneck of good character, one of the honest country folks of America at a point in his life. But it was long ago. The “rednecks” are good people who have nothing in common with the Clintons.His attempts to include himself or equate themselves with American rednecks is exceedingly offensive. It’s far worse than being described by the words deplorable, unredeemable, racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, or Islamaphobic. Being compared to a Clinton, as in being labeled a Democrat or like Obama, is the worst type of insult that one person can direct towards a patriot. Predator Bill probably knows that.Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'That time is gone when  Indian democracy had four leading pillars. Now it has five such pillars with fifth being the Social Media. In the 21st century, social media is playing a vital role in the formation of government. Political parties are now realizing its potential and are trying to spread their positive influence there.Currently, BJP has the maximum number of supporters on social media and hence it is easily winning polls conducted on such platforms. In a press conference on Sunday, BJP president Amit Shah urged election commissioner to conduct the next Loksabha elections on twitter. Right from 2014 elections, BJP had a strong grip on Twitter and has maintained it till date. It was after losing the 2014 Lok Sabha election, that Congress realized the power of social media. Party Vice President Rahul Gandhi has asked all the INC members to be active on various social media platforms. Rahul Gandhi himself doesn’t have any social media account and his office account @OfficeOfRG tweets his whereabouts. Congress’s official handle has started a new hashtag, #KnowYourLegacy, under which it conducts polls. The aim of the poll is to make people aware about various good work that congress has done during its regime. What congress is trying to do is not going its way. People are not believing that congress has done any good work and in a majority of polls winner is usually someone linked with BJP.Congress has alleged BJP supporters of booth capturing. Allegedly, a few anti-congress elements are manipulating the polls and making BJP people win the polls.  This is not only creating a wrong impression of congress among youths but also showing people’s lack of trust in congress. Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has blamed BJP for Congress’ poor performance in Twitter polls. Arvind Kejriwal in Delhi assembly said, “Ye BJP wale twitter polls hack kar lete hain.. aur kuch to logon se phone maang k poll karke phone wapis kar dete hain.. Maine dekha hai ji. Maine vote congress ko diya tha magar wo chala gaya BJP ko.. ye sab modi ji karwa rahe hain.“Election commission has not reacted to Amit Shah’s request yet but it has certainly led to a lesson for Congress social media, which is now avoiding BJP members in its polls. But it seems Congress is not having acche din that’s why even when BJP members aren’t there in the poll people are making NOTA win.',fake
'New Delhi: Arnab Goswami’s newly launched channel Republic TV may have been getting more and more TRPs but it looks like they won’t get any representative from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) now for their debates. BJP President Amit Shah came up with this decision after observing that their party spokespersons spend all the debates nodding when Arnab speaks and then repeating what Arnab has just spoken. Since they were redundant there, these leaders will be sent to other channels for the debates.Confirming the development, a senior BJP leader said, “Yes it is true that we wont be sending any official representative for the debates on Republic TV. Arnab is handling everything nicely so there is nothing much for us to add there. He launches all these attacks on the opposition and we start wondering whether we are from BJP or he is. Anyway, it is clear to our leadership that we are just wasting our time on those debates and that time can be used more usefully elsewhere.”Republic TV hasn’t officially reacted to this news yet though they have experience of certain political parties skipping their debates. A Faking News source inside Republic TV said ,”How does it matter who is coming for the debates or not, bolna to Arnab ne hi hai. We have 10-12 windows on the screen for every debate, some guests leave without getting the chance to speak even once. With BJP not sending their spokesperson, maybe these poor souls will get the chance to say something.”Meanwhile, as per sources, Republic TV has stopped recruiting journalists for now and started recruiting only lawyers to keep up with all the lawsuits coming their way.',fake

'No this is not a joke, and it is not satire.  As part of its investigation into Hillary Clinton and her illegal email practices, between subpoenas from the FBI via the State Department and Freedom of Information Act requests, the FBI did a number of interviews with former and current State Department people, and within those interviews comes the stunning information that in 2014, somehow, two boxes of Hillary Clinton’s emails disappeared.  From Fox News:Buried in the 189 pages of heavily redacted FBI witness interviews from the Hillary Clinton email investigation are details of yet another mystery — about two missing “bankers boxes” filled with the former secretary of state’s emails.The interviews released earlier this month, known as 302s, also reveal the serious allegation that senior State Department official Patrick Kennedy applied pressure to subordinates to change the classified email codes so they would be shielded from Congress and the public.The details about the boxes are contained in five pages of the FBI file – with a staggering 111 redactions – that summarize the statements of a State Department witness who worked in the “Office of Information Programs and Services (IPS).” The employee told the FBI that, “Initially, IPS officials were told there were 14 bankers boxes of former Secretary of State Hillary CLINTON’s emails at CLINTON’s Friendship Heights office.” Friendship Heights is a neighborhood that straddles the Northwest neighborhood of the District of Columbia and Maryland.The State Department witness further explained to the FBI that “on or about December 5, 2014, IPS personnel picked up only 12 bankers boxes of CLINTON’s emails from Williams & Connolly.Yes, this is a little confusing, but our good friend at Fox, Judge Andrew Napolitano was kind enough to unravel the mystery of where the two boxes in question originated, and why there is a real problem with them going missing.So, not only was all the information on where the emails traveled missing because Hillary & Company thought they would pull a fast one and PRINT them rather than provide the electronic files to the FBI, but somewhere between her office, her lawyer’s office and the FBI picking up the evidence during discovery, two boxes turn up missing.And the Clinton Campaign and mainstream media want us to concentrate on an eleven year old men’s locker room conversation where her presidential race opponent was talking like an alpha male about women.  Uh-huh.Yes, there’s a constant drip, drip, drip of damning information, and the presidential election is running interference with help from the mainstream media.  The whole thing stinks just the same.  The interviews with staffers tell of a mystery within a mystery of names redacted and one high-level staffer trying to get Hillary Clinton’s email address removed from the source files.',fake
'Project Veritats strikes again.  It’s doubtful that New York City Democratic Commissioner of the Board of Elections Alan Schulkin knew he was on candid camera, but…he was.  He was caught on camera and revealed a number of things about how voter fraud works in New York, and dropped this tidbit about what he REALLY thinks about voting laws in the United States.“Yeah, they should ask for your ID. I think there is a lot of voter fraud,” said Schulkin, who elaborated on the types of voter fraud that are taking place in New York.“You know, I don’t think it’s too much to ask somebody to show some kind of an ID…Like I say, people don’t realize, certain neighborhoods in particular they bus people around to vote,” said Schulkin. – Project VeritasSo, just so we have this straight:What is actually refreshing about this clandestine interview is the disgust that a Democratic operative has for the tactics and methods that Democrats employ to stay in control.  They are not honest, and that is bothersome to this man.  That’s actually a nice thing to see, even if he feels he has no choice but to vote for Hillary Clinton.New York is just one state of the 50, but if this is the sort of shenanigans going on in the big cities, no wonder they are firmly in Democratic control.  Not much about the election process seems to be above board at all.',fake
'It may not have been the October Surprise Julian Assange was promising, or even James O’Keefe for that matter, but when James Comey announced on Friday that the FBI was looking into additional Hillary Clinton emails found during a completely different investigation, all hell broke loose on the American political landscape.There is no comprehensive timeline as yet in this whole episode of the Foggy Bottom Theater of Scandal, BUT a few juicy tidbits have trickled out.D.C. Whispers is reporting that Comey did not inform anyone in the administration of his decision to inform Congress that he was looking into the emails found in the “unrelated investigation,” which we all now know is the former Congressman Anthony Weiner’s underage sex case.Rumors are now circulating that FBI Director James Comey has gone rogue. His decision to inform members of Congress (both Democrats and Republicans) that new and potentially critical evidence has surfaced related to the months-ago concluded Hillary Clinton illegal server/private email scandal, has sent ripples of stunned shock throughout the entirety of the Obama administration, and left the Clinton campaign bracing for what could be stunning pre-Election Day fallout.As of now, the still-developing story goes something like this:Comey recently learned of new information linked to the infamous FBI Hillary Clinton investigation concluded last summer. He acted quickly to inform leading members of Congress on what he found, telling Attorney General Loretta Lynch he felt “compelled” to do so. That act was in direct violation of Lynch’s wishes that no such public revelation be forthcoming prior to the presidential election.In fact, some are suggesting Lynch had already promised both President Obama, and Hillary Clinton, that the Comey decision would not be made public before Election Day.And then it was – leaving Obama, Lynch, and Clinton furious.As it happens, Judicial Watch actually knew for some time that Huma Abedin had been forwarding emails to her personal email address on Yahoo for years.  What they did not know, was where they would be found: on Weiner’s notebook computer.  And here’s the kicker…THERE’S TENS OF THOUSANDS OF THEM. from Zero Hedge:It remains to be seen just what is in the emails, although whether Hillary sent emails with confidential content herself, or directed, or simply allowed her closest aide, Huma Abedin to forward such emails to her outside unsecured email address (where they subsequently ended up on Anthony Weiner’s notebook), is what this latest case will be all about and how it will be defended and prosecuted in the media, by the water coolers and perhaps, in court.However, we do know one thing: according to the NYT, the number of Huma emails that made their way to Weiner’s PC was staggering:The F.B.I. is investigating illicit text messages that Mr. Weiner, a former Democratic congressman from New York, sent to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. The bureau told Congress on Friday that it had uncovered new emails related to the Clinton case — one federal official said they numbered in the tens of thousands.Sundance over at Conservative Treehouse is reporting the same information in addition to the fact that it was the New York Police Department that first found this stash of emails. They turned them over to the FBI field office in New York.Why Abedin would do this is a matter for speculation at this point – and the comment galleries on Reddit, Free Republic, and elsewhere are all speculating away. (The most popular theory is that the emails were a form of life insurance.)  The end result, though, is that Huma Abedin is not with the Clinton Campaign for president on their current trip.  From Red State Watcher:Huma Abedin has VOIDED her immunity deal with the FBI. This means she has to sing or face jail time. Hillary Clinton no longer wants her around. According to reporters on Hillary’s campaign, Abedin is no longer sitting near the front cabin on her plane to Florida. She’s no where to be found this morning.One of the emails in the Podesta cache indicated that Huma was the “institutional knowledge” of Hillary’s public service.  If that is the case, she could make a star witness for anyone investigating the crime syndicate since the voiding of her immunity deal was more in the way of lying about her actions under oath.  A new one can always be issued.The big question now, is what is in those tens of thousands of emails? Are they some of the ones that were wiped with BleachBit?  Are there any about Chelsea’s wedding or yoga? Did any come from the White House? What level of classification does the intelligence have?',fake
'Rakesh Bemaani, the 16-year old son of billionaire Lokesh Bemaani, was caught in a mad chase yesterday, which resulted in his father being attacked by a vicious, bloodthirsty mob. The reason? The unsuspecting youngster was wearing one of the popular t-shirts that read “My dad is an ATM.”A horrified Rakesh has vowed to never, ever don the t-shirt henceforth. “There I was, zooming around in my Merc as usual, with a few cops on the road saluting me. But as I was driving, I happened to notice large queues on the roads, outside ATMs. I thought of seeing what the problem was and stepped out of the car. The moment the crowd saw me, they looked intently at each other and before I knew it, they collectively sprinted towards me, gunning for my throat. I quickly hopped into my car and sped away, but they chased me unflinchingly. Thankfully, I saw my dad, surrounded by a few security guards, just returning from his morning walk. The guards were of no avail, as the mob overpowered them with ease and started frisking dad all over. Some of them even stuffed his mouth with their debit cards, hoping for some notes to come out. Thankfully, dad had only ?500 and ?1000 rupee notes in his wallet, so the mobsters threw the wallet right back at his face, spat at us and went back. It was only after the melee subsided, did I realize the reason for it all happening – I was wearing one of my dozen of ‘My dad is an ATM’ t-shirts. Phew! Never putting these on again,” the harrowed Rakesh narrated to The UnReal Times.Companies manufacturing the t-shirts have offered to insert a ‘NOT’ in the middle of the statement for free. “We’re recalling all such t-shirts and without any payment, we’re willing to stitch a ^ NOT after the ‘is’ and before the ‘an.’ The safety and security of our customers is our topmost concern,” one such clothing manufacturer stated.The Bemaani family, however, received a flurry of support from the Bollywood fraternity. Tweeting to PM Narendra Modi was actor Arshad Warsi, who stated, “Mr. PM, your so-called masterstroke and surgical strike is paining not only the poor and common men, but also the billionaires. Of what good is all this, really? Can you please come back to India and repeal this goddamn rule? I don’t mind sponsoring your return ticket, if you do this!” Warsi was followed by director Anurag Kashyap, who tweeted angrily to the PM demanding an apology.The Bemaani family was also visited by Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, who sat in protest against the abrupt demonetization scheme. “Like aloo ki factories, we also need paise ki factories instead of ATMs. If we empower the villagers, we can get this done soon,” the Nehru-Gandhi scion stated. The Delhi CM was far more scathing in his diatribe. “The psychopath isn’t happy with the already prevailing smog. He wants more people to come out to the streets, thereby increase the smog and punish Delhites fatally for not voting for him. Yehi to scam hai ji,” the AAP chief yelled.A section of liberal democrats in the US, however, hailed the development as a sweet revenge against the presidential election of Donald Trump. “It’s all happening! Billionaires all over the world will have to incur people’s wrath like this, for having one of their own, and a racist, bigot, xenophobe at that, as the US president,” said one such tolerant, intellectual democrat.',fake
'Hillary Clinton’s national campaign headquarters was evacuated Friday evening after a white powdery substance was discovered.The standard, white envelope was found by a staffer at Clinton’s 45th St. office in Manhattan, where mail is received, around 5:30 p.m. It was then taken to her Brooklyn headquarters.The 11th floor office at One Pierrepont Plaza in Brooklyn Heights was evacuated after a second staffer called 911.An NYPD spokesman declined to identify the substance, but said that tests showed it was not harmful. A total of four people were exposed to the substance but no one reported health problems.The incident just adds to an extremely intense and divisive election season.

His dirty dealings came to light in 2005, and since the reclusive billionaire was friends with Prince Andrew, former President Bill Clinton, and Stephen Hawking, the world came to quickly know his name and his darkest secrets”, Anonymous recalls. The about to be exposed video from hackers are making allegations that, if proven true, will dissolve Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the entire presidential race into further chaos like we’ve never seen.The hacking group claims they have video evidence of Bill Clinton raping a 13-year-old girl while at Jeffrey Epstein’s “Orgy Island. In their video, Anonymous details Bill’s alleged rape of the minor, stating Hillary was aware of the crime and worked to cover it up and promising to a video substantiating their claims will be released to the public in the near future.The Clintons must be held accountable and charged for their dirty crimes.  Hillary for her cyber crimes, lies, betrayal to our nation and  Bill for his rapes along with his perverted pleasures as a pedophile while being President of the United States of America.',fake

Firefighters used chainsaws to extricate victims from inside the bus with little room to maneuver.“The whole front of the bus up to about the second or third row of seats was completely crushed into the left rear side of the semi truck,” Aleman told The Desert Sun. “By the time I got there there were at least a dozen firefighters climbing into the passenger bus pulling people out.”This deadly accident completely halted traffic for hours on the westbound lanes with curious onlookers clogging traffic on the eastbound lanes to gaze onto the horrific scene. All westbound lanes remain closed at this time. The CHP estimates it may be until 4 p.m. until the westbound lanes are reopened.',fake
'On the other side of the pond, the people are not so squeamish as Americans descended from Puritans about betting.  In fact, they’ll bet on just about anything, even elections.  In 2016, the Vegas odds may well be still showing a Hillary Clinton win, but over in the old country, United Kingdom, specifically, the system that correctly predicted the Brexit vote, is now giving improved odds for a Donald Trump victory.  The handicap is now 4-1 rather than 11-2 courtesy of “punters.”  From the UK Independent via The Gateway Pundit:Bookmaker William Hill says 71 per cent of the money so far staked is for Democrat Hillary Clinton. But 65 per cent of the bets by number are for the controversial Republican.That means a lot more punters are putting smaller bets on Trump, almost exactly the same pattern as was seen in the run up to the Brexit vote when the money was for Remain but the majority of bets were for Leave.To interpret that for those who know American English rather than the Queeen’s, the bets with more money are counting on a Hillary win, while the “punters” or smaller betters, are placing MORE bets overall.  Therefore, the handicap corrected.  This is the same movement that the bookmakers saw ahead of the Brexit vote when the people of United Kingdom said to the globalists that they did not want to be part of the European Union.  Not that the British government has done anything about that since, though.',fake
'This is just disgusting.We all know that the media is always covering for Democrats, but this takes lying to a whole new level.After the 2nd Presidential debate, CNN was caught telling members of their focus group what to say against Trump. You can hear the host whispering to an African American woman at the beginning of the clip at the 05 second mark….   Now I expect the media to be bias, but CNN was just caught staging the news! The Clinton News Network just couldn’t stand that Trump had an amazing debate performance. CNN even went as far as manipulating their debate poll. They claim that Hillary won the debate 57\% 34\%.If you dig a little deeper you will see that the only reason they came out with those results was because they over-sampled Democrats nearly 2 to 1. They did the same thing the first presidential debate.After the September 27th debate they released their poll and announced that Hillary won 62\% of the vote compared to Trump’s 27\%.They plastered their poll all over the internet with the headline “Hillary takes round one!”Too bad that statement isn’t even close to the truth.  CNN only sampled 27\% of Republicans in the poll, compared to 74\% of Democrats and Independents.  In fact, a staggering 41\% identified as Democrat! CNN only sampled 521 people and 3/4 of them were liberal. CNN has lost the little credibility they had left. Share this and expose them for LYING to their viewers and insulting our intelligence!',fake
'When the Democrats were looking for a candidate to run with the criminal Hillary Clinton, they put out an announcement that that they were looking for a Veep. Tim Kaine thought they said Creep, so he applied. Ultimately he got the job based on his entire package, as hard as that is to understand.Kaine is asked about comments demeaning the Catholic Faith by the Clinton Communications Director, something that he’s perfectly fine with. It’s not like they had insulted a “real religion,” right Tim, like Islam? You Democrats would be twisting each other’s panties into knots and wringing your hands bloody if somebody in your camp had insulted the pet religion. Christians are fair game anytime.According to documents released by WikiLeaks, Jen Palmieri was engaged in a 2011 discussion with a Democrat strategist who denounced what he described as the Catholics’ “severely backwards gender relations.” Palmieri responded that “some conservatives are only Catholic because they think it is the most socially acceptable politically conservative religion.”Martha Raddatz says that many took offense to the perceived mockery and offered slimy Tim a chance to squirm his campaign’s way out of it. Before he attempts to spin the situation into something harmless, the sleaze ball first feels obligated to discredit WikiLeaks, who has a one hundred percent accuracy record on their releases, saying that he doesn’t give them any credence. Of course you don’t you crooked weasel, they’re exposing your corruption.Raddatz pointed out that the author of the email acknowledged that he said it, to which Kaine deftly replied, “Yeah, I, but, but,  but I, I, this is an important topic that everybody needs to know about these emails.” This dolt just said everybody needs to know about the emails? That was in the next breath after he said, “I don’t even know if they’re accurate and they are part of an effort by the Russians and WikiLeaks to “destabilize the election.” Right, the Russians wrote all of those emails and signed everybody’s names to them too, didn’t they Tim?This dull blade went on national television where a question is asked that he should have expected, in which the interviewer had time to verify the veracity of it but their “communications director didn’t? His default response is the same as his running mate, dismiss, divert and play dumb. In his case, there might not be much acting involved. He raises the inevitable “one email” that doesn’t really exist that was inaccurate for reasons he doesn’t know as his best lame defense. Way to hit it out of the park, Kaine.The abortion advocate goes on to the topic of his Catholicism, which he says he’s “very serious about” and Hillary Clinton views it as an asset. Kaine, who wears a Clinton pin rather than an American flag pin in recognition of the candidate who also wears no American flag pin, says Clinton values his faith. He knows it’s true because he and Clinton have each discussed their “faith backgrounds,” and that was part of why she just had to have him on the ticket. The more he talks the less believable his lies become.Asked if an apology would be forthcoming, Kaine said “We all have opinions and I don’t think you need to apologize for your opinions.” Good thing Tim, because everyone in the audience is of the opinion that you’re a useless boob. It would have been interesting to hear his response if they had accused Muslims of being believers of convenience or having severely backwards gender relations, what with women having to cover their faces, walk behind men and not drive a car.Would that have been acceptable and dismissed as just an opinion as well, Mr. Kaine? Would that have been part of Clinton’s “respect for the Church and people’s faith lives?” Of course not; there’s a double standard for everything with Democrats. Christians are always fair game, Muslims never are.Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'An excise duty higher than the price of a cigarette. Death of father due to excessive smoking. Watching Mukesh on the deathbed in cinema halls. Two broken relationships due to bad breath. Rahul Dravid getting run out due to partner’s mistake. All these could not deter 25-year-old Raunak from smoking, until the price of mouth freshener increased after the introduction of GST.Raunak, a resident of New Delhi, got addicted to smoking soon after his father, who was a chain smoker, passed away due to lung cancer. Despite making several efforts to quit the harmful habit, he failed. Friends and family eventually distanced themselves from Raunak owing to the habit. “Both my girlfriends started dating me when they realised that I am rich as I spent a huge amount on cigarettes,” said Raunak, who regrets smoking as the same girls left him for his horrible breath. After the implementation of GST, Raunak could not afford to buy the expensive chewing gum which had served him as a mouth freshener for years. “Every time I bought myself a chewing gum, the thought of not being able to buy a mouth freshener killed me more than the tobacco in a cigarette ever can!” he said, “and I had to, eventually, quit it.”Earlier this month, the Supreme Court faced immense pressure to ban cigarettes in the view of environment protection. Raunak’s decision to quit smoking was hailed by the Supreme Court. “After banning the sale of firecrackers in Delhi-NCR, people started questioning us about the pollution caused by due to smoking. Rather than banning cigarettes and tobacco, we chose to increase the price of mouth fresheners,” said a judge at the Supreme Court.The move has been termed a major success by environmentalists across the country. Judges at the Supreme Court burst firecrackers outside the court to celebrate their victory over pollution.',fake
'Goa: The recently concluded BRICS summit brought the leaders of 5 big big economies together in their fight against terrorism. There was a consensus related to actions against terrorist outfits.The leaders discussed on all things other than terrorism, that included food, culture, hobbies and future aspirations. The Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has as many as 1 billion pronunciations in India, was very vocal about his distaste for Indian Chinese food. Indians have literally customized the Chinese menu according to their own taste.Some of the famous Chinese food on Indian menu are ‘Gobi Manchurian’, ‘Paneer Chilly’, ‘Chinese Bhel’ and lot more. It’s a surprise that Chinese have no clue about what these fucking dishes are, and Indians are selling it with the brand name of China.Xi Jinping was very furious with the dish name ‘Chinese Bhel’, as it is just a disproportionate mixture of all Chinese ingredients. He strongly condemned the invention of such dishes in India. In fact, he has urged PM Modi to personally look into the matter and ban the dish across India. Once the dish is completely banned in India, China will withdraw its support to Pakistan, he assured.Indians are very attached to the Chinese Bhel, and it seems very difficult to ban it in near future, but with China’s offer of isolating Pakistan, we can very well think of implementing the ban.Or else, we should at least change the name of the dish, for 11 Jinping’s sake.',fake
'It was sort of inevitable actually.  When Donald Trump made some pretty strong statements about China and their exploitative exportation habits that he would see curbed with a hefty tariff, there was a pall in the pollution coming from Beijing and Shanghai.  The Chinese were not amused.  Now that Mr. Trump is president elect despite the best efforts to derail the movement he put a face on, the Chinese made the opening salvo in the potential trade war.An opinion piece was published on Monday in the Global Times, a communist party mouthpiece, decrying the rhetoric and threatening American business interests in the country.“A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.,” the Global Times article read.Maize?  Who calls it maize anymore?  And, please, fewer Chinese exchange students means more spots in the tech fields for Americans…if they can get in.But wait.  The Global Times wasn’t done.“If Trump imposes a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports, China-U.S. trade will be paralyzed,” the Global Times said.The opinion piece said Trump was a “shrewd businessman” and would not be naive, but, if he was serious with the policy, it would affect a number of U.S. industries.“The new president will be condemned for his recklessness, ignorance and incompetence and bear all the consequences. We are very suspicious the trade war scenario is a trap set up by some American media to trip up the new president,” the Global Times wrote.It has been noted that 45\% was either a number Trump just tossed out, or it was a starting place for negotiation.  The reality is that without the United States, China would have a much harder time selling its goods, even if they do make things quick, dirty and cheap.  Some examples:Oh, that’s right.  The Chinese don’t have copyright infringement – or stealing trade secrets – in their culture.  At least not coming from the government.The specific threats to Apple and Boeing are fairly ripe targets given the iconic nature of the companies involved. Boeing is operating in China sort of by invitation (more like a threat) since the Chinese insist that the products sold in their country be made there (basically so they can steal the technology), and Apple is making the iPhone there simply because there is no tariff and if they made their products in the U.S. at this point the phones would be twice as expensive, and far more of a status symbol than they already are.And in the cheap crap mode of Chinese goods, this writer had one that would just quit working whenever it felt like it, hence a switch to Android.  Am saving up for an iBook, though.Has a trade war really begun?  Maybe, maybe not.  President-Elect Trump did have a conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping last week.  The Trump team said there was mutual respect.  We’ll see.More at Extreme Tech. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMyVisits Counter \r\n',fake

'Mumbai: Citizens across Mumbai have collectively issued an apology to news editors for ignoring floods in Assam and not reporting on them extensively. Questions were raised by several news editors over lack of coverage of Assam floods in the media and Mumbaikars have put their hands up and taken full responsibility for it.As Mumbai roads got flooded yesterday after the heavy rains, every news channel started covering the Mumbai rains and ran minute by minute coverage from the financial capital of India. Every drop of rain was captured by media and this focus led several news editors to question the difference in media coverage between Assam and Mumbai floods.Speaking to Faking News, a Dadar resident said ,”As responsible citizens, it is our duty to cover all the important news from every corner of the country but we dropped the ball in Assam. We totally ignored the floods there but talked about the flooding outside our homes nonstop for the past 24 hours. After reading all the tweets from news editors criticizing the lack of coverage of Assam, we realized how selfish we have been. We sincerely apologize for our mistake and promise to correct it as soon as possible.”Another Mumbai resident from Parel echoed similar sentiments. He said ,”I am immediately leaving for Assam. From there, I will update live pictures of the floods and will provide details of the relief measures needed in the state. As citizens, it is our duty to cover news from remote places.”Several news editors have appreciated this apology but have also asked why is there no coverage of Gorkhaland agitation in the media.',fake
'Appearing exhausted and spent after the debate Wednesday night, Hillary Clinton made her way back to the microphone-holding boot-lickers to give them their next message to put out on behalf of the Democrat Party.Clinton told the suck-ups in her posse that she was both relieved and grateful that there were no more debates. The relieved part makes sense, she doesn’t have worry as much about having another seizure or fit in front of America. She can now keep her events to less than ninety minutes, to a length that will allow her to not have to take medication rest days in order to survive an hour and a half public appearance.\r\nClinton is grateful, apparently to the adoring press and others, who have looked the other way as she has committed fraudulent acts and struggled to maintain appearances. They could have told the story as it was happening but thanks to them and some equally corrupt Secret Service Agents, the American people will remain ignorant and this unfit criminal may end up in office.The diminutive criminal granny laments that she won’t be getting anymore naps now that the debates are all done. The two should have nothing to do with each other were she not attempting to manage her serious medical condition. Now that those “long” ninety-minute symptom free periods are less of an issue, she’s not going to be needing her nappy time.She’s asked if she’ll respect the results of the election and never answers, instead choosing to vilify Trump for again telling the truth, this time regarding the fraud and coercion being carried out against him. Trump admitted he reserves the right to challenge manipulated or fraudulent results. Clinton won’t admit that she’d do exactly that, if she were on the side that is not manipulating and committing fraud. Since she’s the criminal, she’s attacking him for exposing her.In her attack on Trump, Clinton, of all people, actually says that the United States is “a country based on laws.” She’s unable to do it with a straight face, having to exaggerate the point with raised eyebrows, closed eyes and a head wobble. Right, Mrs. Clinton, that’s three sets of laws to be exact. There’s one for the elite establishment criminals, one for the imported replacement Americans, and one for your enemies, the American people.Most of the rest of the video is more of the media allowing the focus to be directed away from what is important onto superfluous side issues. None of the order takers took advantage of the jaw-dropping “country based on laws” comment, although that’s the kind of thing journalists are supposed to do. It simply wouldn’t be servile enough to ask of Mrs. Clinton, therefore it’s not appropriate.One of those huddled around her did summon up the integrity and courage to ask about the Project Veritas videos. Clinton’s response was similar to what she told the FBI when asked about many of her other crimes. She simply claimed ignorance, stating, “You know I know nothing about all of this, I can’t deal with every one of his conspiracy theories, but I hope you all have something to eat and something to drink on the way back to New York.”Of course they are not conspiracy theories, they are conspiracy realities with video evidence that was strong enough to force the resignation of two of their chief racketeers. One of those goons has visited the White House 342 time since 2009, 47 of those meetings were face to face with Obama. That goes far beyond mere hyperbole.Clinton took off like a scalded cat when the subject that could undo every false assertion she had just made being broached. She offered a bribe of food to the order takers, and something to drink before turning tail and bolting away, with a finger effectively stuck in each ear.We get the message, Clinton, – Take some free food, get drunk, I’m outta here. And get that reporter who asked the taboo corruption and racketeering question off of my plane now.

'The corrupt individuals behind the equally corrupt candidate have unleashed their assault on Donald Trump in the form of an eleven year old video tape. That’s supposed to completely distract the American people and so outrage us by the language that he used that we will completely ignore the fact that Hillary Clinton is a traitor to America and that her criminal syndicate includes most of the government that props her up.One of those intertwined in the corrupt snake den of Washington DC is John Podesta, her campaign chairman. He was also Bill Clinton’s chief of staff at the White House and Obama’s senior advisor on issues including the hoax designed specifically to steal power and money from the US and other citizens and line the pockets of the globalist pirates, climate change.After hearing that WikiLeaks had released some of his hacked emails, the high and mighty Podesta tried to do two things, deflect away from the content and imply that others were guilty of the same things. His first of four Tweets attempted to do both, saying, “While I’m in pretty good company with Gen. Powell & Amb. Marshall…”The second was a diversion from the content and another attempt at the same tactic that has been in play since the first DNC email problems became evident, the claim that Russians are to blame. He wrote, ” I’m not happy about being hacked by the Russians in their quest to throw the election to Donald Trump.” The odds are that since he and his syndicate were able to sell America’s uranium to the Russians for a huge profit and to their strategic military benefit, they are probably not in Trump’s corner. As for the larger claim of “the Russians did it,” Podesta’s not a stupid man so his complete missing of the point is obviously deliberate. It doesn’t really matter who exposed what he was doing, he was still doing it.Next he implied, without actually having to lie about any specific documents which could later be disproven, that the documents and the information they contained was false. “Don’t have time to figure out which docs are real and which are faked…,” the busy little international mobster wrote.He then went on to parse a completely irrelevant point that about the current ownership structure of the influence peddling company that he and his brother started and operate, the Podesta Group. He said, “But, for starters, Assange’s first claim that I co-own the Podesta Group is completely false.”We might also inquire of Mr. Podesta if the clients who they act as a spokesperson and advocate in the halls of government inside the United States are also false or it they are correctly listed on their Wikipedia page as: Wal-Mart, BP, Lockheed Martin, Abdisalam Omer, American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, Amgen, Bank Of America, Cherokee Nation (Casinos), Cintas, Covidien, Duke Energy, Egypt, Genentech, General Dynamics, Harrah’s Entertainment, Heineken, Merck, Michelin, National Association of Broadcasters (NAB), National Public Radio (NPR), Nestle, Novartis, Orange County, Florida, Raytheon, Reed Elsevier, Republic of Albania, Republic of Georgia, Sallie Mae, Sunoco, Synthetic Genomics, TJX Companies, Tyco Electronics, Republic of Kenya and United Technologies.We could also ask if there were any conflicts of interest in the decisions made by the White House while he was a senior adviser or his candidate the Secretary of State that would have benefited any of those he represents for a fee. The authoritarian government of Azerbaijan has his company on a monthly retainer of $60,000 plus expenses. What are they getting in return?His client  Abdisalam Omer is a dual citizen Somali American who has held positions as the Chief of Staff of the Mayor of the District of Columbia, Director of the UNDP Somalia Financial Services and Governance Program, and a Chief Business Officer for the District of Columbia Public Schools. He also served as Governor of the Central Bank of Somalia in 2013 and, as of February 2015, is the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Somalia.Did his representation play a role quashing the DC school voucher program or in the high levels of Somali immigration into the US? It seems to be the most likely explanation for both nonsensical federal actions under this regime.And how about Obama’s trip to Kenya and all the taxpayer money he promised to throw their way. Was that just based upon his birth connection or was there a little of the customary pay for play being exercised there as well? And those potential and likely conflicts of interest don’t even get into the defense contractors, pharmaceutical manufacturers and bankers on your client list.How deep does the corruption go? Clearly it’s as deep as one is willing to look.Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'Project Veritas did some of their usual great hidden camera investigative reporting, with Hillary Clinton campaign workers, engaged in voter registration. They reveal a bias against registering Republicans, which is not surprising, on the part of the Democrats. They aren’t supposed to destroy the registration forms, though.At the first part of the video a worker identified as Mark Hodges, a Hillary Clinton field organizer, describes “bolting” when he encountered what he took to be a Trump supporter. He headed for the other side of the parking lot, avoided contact and having to register the enemy.Trevor Lafauci is a campaign coordinator for the Clinton campaign. He explains that those who want to register as Democrats are offered the opportunity to vote by mail. If they want to register as Republicans, the offer is not made. Voting by mail is just too easy and extending that same opportunity would have the effect of eliminating a Democrat advantage. Why would they fight voter ID laws tooth and nail and then not utilize them to commit voter fraud?A Project Veritas reporter told Mr. Lafauci that he had ripped up three Republican voter registration forms or ballots, and asked if he would get in trouble for doing it. He was reassured by Mr. Lafauci that he would not get in trouble and that it would not be reported to anyone. He thanked him for being conscientious enough to report it to him.He makes his small talk and excuses for effect and then asks Lafauci one last time if he’s “cool with it.” Lafauci says that he is, as long as the reporter doesn’t make a habit of it.That was the pretext upon which the confrontation was based later, with a Project Veritas reporter coming in an asking Lafauci about that very incident. The report asks, “I was just wondering, is the Hillary campaign staff okay with ripping up voter registrations for Republicans?”He plays dumb, saying, “I’m not sure what you’re talking about.” He’s reminded of the earlier conversation with a “Project Veritas reporter named Max,” whom he denies knowing. The reporter asks how he respond to video if he had it in his possession with Lafauci talking to Max and telling him it’s okay to rip up Republican ballots and that he wouldn’t be reported, asking him if he doesn’t want to comment on that.As he reminds him of the comment about not making a habit out of it, the second bolt of the video is engaged in, as he heads for the parking lot and the safety of his vehicle.Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'The Obama Clinton corruption is everywhere. An FBI official who was promoted during the investigation of Hillary Clinton and her obvious criminal actions received $675,000 in cash and services into their household in the form of “campaign donations” to his wife. Oddly, she seems to have not been seriously entertaining the notion of running for office prior to being selected by the corrupt Governor of Virginia, seemingly out of the blue. She had to be convinced in a private meeting with Governor Terry McAuliffe, the former DNC Chief, and close Clinton ally to run, “for the good of the state.”The donations took the form of $467,500 in cash and another $207,788 worth of support in the form of campaign mailers. The candidate was Dr. Jill McCabe, who met with McAuliffe only once. In that meeting he persuaded her to embark on her unsuccessful run for the Virginia State Senate. Her husband is Andrew McCabe, has since been promoted to deputy director of the FBI and had oversight of Clinton’s case once promoted.It’s an interesting theory, that McAuliffe or his representatives identified McCabe as a potential willing accomplice and promised him, his wife, or both, that they would shower her with cash and perhaps a seat in the State’s Senate and to give him a nice promotion. All he had to do in return was to deep six the Clinton investigation or agree to go along with the decision of their compromised Director, James Comey.According to the Wall Street Journal, “A spokesman for the governor said he ‘supported Jill McCabe because he believed she would be a good state senator. This is a customary practice for Virginia governors… Any insinuation that his support was tied to anything other than his desire to elect candidates who would help pass his agenda is ridiculous.\'” Put more correctly, anyone who believes this crooked Democrat’s line of crap is an idiot. Of course it was a relatively clean way for them to funnel large amounts of money to her in exchange for political favors. It’s the quid pro quo that Clinton and her circle of corruption thrive upon.The excuses from the FBI and those involved in the scheme are laughable in their criminal transparency and dependence upon the naiveté of the public for their consumption. The FBI issued a statement saying that Mr. McCabe “played no role, attended no events, and did not participate in fundraising or support of any kind. Months after the completion of her campaign, then-Associate Deputy Director McCabe was promoted to Deputy, where, in that position, he assumed for the first time, an oversight role in the investigation into Secretary Clinton’s emails.”Did he help her spend the money? Did he eat any of the food or stay in the house it paid for? And does it really matter that they chose not to promote her husband during the campaign? They put him where he needed to be to benefit Mrs. Clinton when he needed to be there. The campaign was primarily a way to move the money from Democrat fundraisers to one of those who held the decision making power over their future nominee. A time lag provided them with a weak, but their only remotely plausible deniability.The already compromised Comey FBI is providing protection for McCabe and themselves, stating that he recognized the conflict of interest and covered himself by seeking “ethics advice” from the bureau and following it. They instructed him to abstain from involvement in public corruption cases in Virginia or campaign activities. That advice did not extend to the most corrupt individual in all of the federal government, whom he became a de facto agent in support and protection of, Hillary Clinton.In their claims of innocence, the McCabes insist on directing the attention towards the Virginia race, their safe zone from the obvious big picture conflict of interest. Dr. McCabe offered the sophomoric excuse, “Once I decided to run,”[and accept 2/3 of a million bucks and a great job for my husband], “my husband had no formal role in my campaign other than to be a supportive husband to me and our children. As a federal official…everyone who participated in our campaign understood and respected that he could not participate.”He was supportive but had no formal role. Isn’t that sweet. It’s the informal role that stinks to high heaven, Doc. The one that helped Hillary Clinton get away with treason and so much more.',fake
'Bill Still received some information overnight that point out the serious character defects or total lack thereof on the part of the Democrat candidate for president. Hillary Clinton exhibited rage towards the moderator at the Commander-in-Chief Forum, Matt Lauer, for doing in one instance what he should have done for the entire thirty minutes, asking her and pressing her on a question that she hadn’t been fed in advance. She was supposed to go out, recite responses that were well rehearsed and wait for Trump to be caught off guard. Instead it was she who got the surprise and that triggered a rage that we’ve rumors of. Now a firsthand accounting of what happened was sent to Bill Still, and he’s sharing it with America.The source of his information originated at a Comcast email address, the parent company of NBC.  It is supposedly from members of the technical crew that worked the event and describes what happened moments after Clinton walked off the set. They described “a massive profanity-laced tirade” on the part of Clinton that was directed at Matt Lauer in particular, but had moments for others, including DNC Chairperson Donna Brazile.As he learned, Clinton had been given all of the questions in advance but was tripped up by Lauer asking her something she hadn’t been given, throwing her completely off her game and script. The topic was a tricky one for Clinton, her use of an illegal home server for the storing, receiving and transmitting of government secret documents. One of those working the event for Comcast described her as visibly beginning to boil with the asking of that question.Her outburst began immediately after she left the stage, with her first throwing a full glass of water into the face of her assistant, with manic, uncontrolled screaming beginning at that point. The source described Clinton as the “most foul-mouthed woman I’ve ever heard, and that voice at screech level – awful.”She also had some racist condescending comments for the black DNC chairman, Brazile, including suggestions that she was better qualified to be the campaign’s janitor.One female NBC executive is quoted as saying that Brazile’s stoic response to the unhinged Clinton only served to enrage her more. She described it saying, “It was the most awful and terrible…and racist display – such a profane meltdown I have ever witnessed from anyone, and I will never forget it.”Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake

It’s unsettling to know that the same, typical network of cronyism and self-serving special interests that is characteristic of the Clintons is so intimately involved with determining if she will be the next president, perhaps more so than the American voters.The Daily Caller reports that Smartmatic controls the voting machines in 16, roughly one third of all states, including the battlegrounds of Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Virginia. They also oversee machines in California, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Louisiana, Missouri, New Jersey, Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin.Small manipulations in critical areas could completely alter the election results, particularly in the already hotly contested battlegrounds. Creating a little credibility by doggedly promoting favorable, and likely false, polls and ignoring crowd sizes would complement the setup for manipulation and a steal.The DC also points out that Smartmatic ran the controversial online balloting for the Utah GOP caucus last March, which was criticized for the inability to secure personal electronic devices that were used to both register and vote. Security doesn’t matter if the results are already predetermined.It seems Soros and company recognize the depraved wisdom of Joseph Stalin.

'Asanshol, 7th October.Rahul Gandhi’s latest political masterstroke made the entire nation unitedly draw draggers against him. But in a sudden turn of events, the Congress has heaved a sigh of relief after finding the entire nation express sympathy, support and “get well soon” wishes from across the country for its cherished scion.The unexpected popularity windfall came after senior Kattappa-esque Congress leader Mr. Kapil Sibal defended the crown prince, pleading that the country “should understand his sentiments”. Close on the heels of this, on-off Congress buddy, the Ashutosh of the AAP tweeted his support, saying “Totly agree with the Sibal. Rahulji totly Centimental and we shud understnd”.Needless to say, the revelation of the century set twitter on fire. Even those with an IQ enough to solve cheap mid-day tabloid puzzles instantly worked out the intricacy and innate wisdom in the Ashutosh’s tweet. This correspondent caught up with a random guy who was bursting crakers to celebrate the expose. “What’s the big deal in cracking the Ashutosh’s code? Even schoolkids know that ‘Centi’ means 100, and mental means mad. That’s it! Straight and simple!”, he screamed deliriously, adding “just what we knew all these years, and were waiting for the Congress to admit it!”. A second later, in an AAP-ish U-turn, the guy added, “I also feel sad for him, though. Lets also pray for his well-being even as we celebrate the admission!”The Congress, in any case, is elated. An insider confided, “In the last couple of years, we had vanished from Indians’ chit-chats. At least this way, we’ve wriggled our way back into tea-stall charchas. The means don’t matter. Our great visionary leader must have taken this great step and risked his reputation for the short term with something long-term in mind”, he hoped dreamily.When asked for his comments, veteran Congressman Mr Digvijay Singh started off with a reflexive, “Of course, Rahul baba is 100 taka…” before abruptly changing his stance to “No comments”.',fake
'Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has made a sensational claim today that congress played a key role in the battle of Ramayana.According to him, his ancestors, who formed Congress party in 7400 BC, joined forces with Lord Rama and carried out surgical strikes across Lanka, destroying Ravana’s terror launch pads.Speaking to The Unreal Times, Mr. Gandhi said, “Surgical strikes happened in the past too. Congress not only conducted surgical strikes under momma…I mean, Dr. Manmohan Singh’s regime but we also did that in prehistoric era. What is Modi bragging about?”“Our ancestors stood by Lord Rama throughout the war but we never sought any credit for that because neki kar dariya mein daal has always been our mantra.”“But it was a full scale war, not a surgical strike,” we decided to engage in a scholarly discussion with the scholar himself.“Do you know the definition of surgical strike?” he asked.“Umm, no.”“Ok, let me explain. Any military attack that we cannot classify under a category is called a surgical strike.”“Okayyyy.”“It lasted for 13 days,” he looked out the window into oblivion as he continued, “Our ancestors fought alongside Lord Rama and decimated the army of Ravana. Do you know something? It was our idea to send Hanuman to burn Lanka.”“Did you?” we asked in a state of shock.“Yes,” he reclined with a self-assured smile, “You know, initially Lord Rama was a bit skeptical about the whole thing. He was like, cool but what if they get to know about our plan and stuff, but we convinced him. We told him that to understand their preparedness against a full-fledged attack, we had to do that. And eventually he agreed.”He played a DVD of Ramanand Sagar’s Ramayan and said, “Do you see them?”“That’s Sugriva and his troop.”“No, towards his left. They were from Gandhi family.”“But going by the theory of Darwin, our ancestors looked the same. How do we know they were Gandhis? Yes, some of you have retained the traits of our ancestors but…”“What was the purpose of the battle? No, you tell me what was the purpose of the battle?”“To rescue Sita?”“Exactly. Women empowerment…I mean women safety, and that was our prime concern even then. Do you need more proofs?”“No. Guess, that will do.”“Great. Now spread the word. By the way, we might raise a demand to rename Dussehra to Rajiv Jayanti.”He changed the DVD and ‘Chhota Bheem’ flashed on the screen. We decided to wrap up the interview.',fake
'Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh elections are nearing and Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi is taking them very seriously atleast on social media. Rahul Gandhi is mixing humour and sarcasm in his tweets and getting a lot of attention and likes.Though Rahul Gandhi has been able to improve his social media image but his fans are yet to see his improved real life image that doesn’t seem to be happening anytime soon. And that’s one of the reasons Congress has requested to conduct Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh assembly elections on Twitter.Congress spokesman and mentor of Rahul Gandhi, Ajay Maken in a press conference on Tuesday revealed that Congress President Sonia Gandhi has written a letter to Election Commission requesting Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh assembly elections to be held on Twitter.After Election Commission refuses to do so Congress accused Election Commission of being biased and also called Modi coward. CM Arvind Kejriwal has also supported Congress’ proposal and has said that conducting election on Twitter will also reduce the chances of EVM hacking.BJP hasn’t yet responded on the issue but seeing the various trolls being fans of PM Modi, BJP will not have any objection to Congress’ request.Sources say that Rahul Gandhi’s social media team has now hired a new person who not only writes tweets for him but also tells him what to reply to trolls. “Rahul Gandhi can get his tweets written by someone else but speeches he has to deliver himself and that’s where he gets exposed” tweeted one of the social media users.',fake
'Former UP Congress leader Rita Bahuguna Joshi’s unbelievable somersault move to the Bharatiya Janata Party was no shock for the Congress, unlike what the media has reported. According to the party, it was a deliberately planned move formulated by their poll strategist Prashant Kishor.“Trust Prashant bhai to come up with strategies never seen before in Indian politics. Be it the Chai pe charcha program of PM Modi, the Bihari vs Bahari campaign of Nitish Kumar, or the Khaat sabha program of Rahul baba, he’s always come up with something out of the box. And this latest strategy of placing Ritaji in the BJP for this poll season is another testimony to his awesomeness. This strategy will prove to be an amazing success and I hereby declare that all of Prashant bhai‘s ?12 meals in future will be on me,” UPCC chief Raj Babbar told The UnReal Times.Explaining further on why this is such a clever move, Babbar said, “See, until yesterday, absolutely no one was listening to us. No matter what we used to say, all our statements fell on deaf ears. Only the khoon ki dalaali remark made some news waves. But now, with Ritaji joining the BJP, the whole of Twitter will have field days for the next few days digging out old tweets of hers and amplifying them all over. Her old tweets will generate such a buzz that our message will be communicated to people more effectively than ever before. He is truly the Kishore Kumar of election strategies.”Congress spokesperson Sanjay Jha stated confidently that the move would hardly matter to the party. “We always have Shatrugan Sinha in the BJP to compensate for the absence of Ritaji, so that’s hardly anything to worry about. What is more worrisome is that in 2002…” Jha stated before The UnReal Times reporter moved away.BJP sources, have, however, played down the strategy. “Kishor thinks he’s done something extraordinary by sending Ritaben here. What do you think Rahul baba is still doing in the Congress party?” winked BJP president Amit Shah. “Ritaben should do well in the BJP. We’re the party that has, after all, accommodated even Sreesanth and Powerstar Dr. Srinivasan. Should she mess things up for us in any way, our Marg Darshak Mandal is always open for another Joshi,” Shah smiled.The leader has been given a very warm welcome by her new party thus far. While MP Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan officially welcomed Joshi to the party with a congratulatory message, Union Sports Minister Vijay Goel formally sealed her induction into the party with a high-definition selfie. “The only thing we’re waiting for, before Ritaben formally begins her work, is an official acronym expansion of RITA by Modiji. We’re told it’ll come soon,” a BJP source added.',fake
'It’s not even a matter of sending mixed messages anymore. The Department of Homeland “Security” under this pretend ‘president’ and his henchman Secretary, Jihadi Jeh Johnson, is an anti-American mechanism for the breaching of every aspect of the security of our nation. That reality is unmistakable. It is being operated as an instrument through which the laws of the United States are circumvented, ignored, violated and nullified as a criminal act by not only Obama and Johnson, but Sarah Saldana, Leon Rodriguez, Alejandro Mayorkas, Gil Kerlikowske and many, many others within DHS who deliberately act in a hostile manner against the interests of the United States. The fact that these criminals are not yet behind bars is only a statement of the depth to which the corruption has permeated our hijacked government.As if ordering our Border Patrol agents to release invaders and become nursemaids is not enough of a slap in the face, DHS held an award ceremony on Thursday honoring one of the primary non-governmental operatives against secure borders. She’s a person who would normally be viewed as an adversary by any administration that was actually interested in securing this nation from an illegal invasion. The award is called the “Outstanding American by Choice” award, a ridiculous name for an award that creates a mockery of the agency bestowing it.The annual award, presented by the subversives at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), is described as an effort to recognize the “significant contributions and achievements of a naturalized” American citizen. Those achievements don’t have to be in a positive manner, apparently, in the tradition of Time magazine naming Hitler their person of the year, but they should be.Today’s recipient runs a billion dollar charity dedicated to helping illegal aliens skirt the law and remain in the United States. The traitor to this nation, who should instead be having her naturalized status revoked by DHS, is Antonia Hernandez. She’s a “civil rights” lawyer that litigates on behalf of illegals for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF).MALDEF also agitates in favor of free college tuition for illegals and the lowering of educational standards so they can get into and not flunk out of college.  As noted by Judicial Watch, “The group’s leadership says it’s racist to make English the country’s official national language and inhumane to protect the southern border with a fence.” Aside from the destructive nature of their actions, DHS is embracing the labeling of their agents as brutal racists and commending the labeling of them as such.What in the world is DHS doing honoring this despicable person who’s loyalty clearly lies with her race and not with the nation who’s laws she is countermanding? Why not find someone who patrols the border on their own time or turned in illegals working in the United States, resulting in their criminal employer being thrown into jail for a few months? There are laws on the books requiring that those actions be taken, but these outlaw officials ignore and demean our laws. Judicial Watch also makes the point that the award Hernandez is being given is supposedly given to someone who demonstrates “their commitment to this country and to the common civic values that unite us all as Americans.” The common values of destroying the United States and breaking as many laws as possible do unite a large percentage of Democrats, but far from all Americans. They should have kept looking.Once Mr. Trump is elected, every significant member of this regime as well as those in Congress who empowered and enabled their lawless rampage against this country, should be immediately arrested and prosecuted for treason. The prescribed sentences should then be carried out immediately as per the Constitution.These people are engaging in an attack on our nation. They are the enemy within. They must be treated as such. Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'Ann Coulter describes “one of the wonderful things about Donald Trump is this attack on political correctness and it is so much more than specific words. It is the political correctness that teaches Americans that we have the worst culture, we are the most oppressive, we oppress all of these poor, third world hordes pouring into our country, that we’re corrupt and dishonest, when the truth is pretty much exactly the opposite.”She says, “By and large, Anglo-Saxon Americans, black Americans, the traditional Americans, pre- the third world hordes coming in, are the most honest, the most respectful of women, children, the vulnerable, the elderly, the unborn. So when we’re bringing in immigrants from vastly different cultures, we’re just inevitably bringing in a lot more corruption and a lot more criminality.”The host describes an FBI undercover agent’s visit to a halal market in which he pretended to be a new arrival to the US and then is given assistance in committing every type of fraud imaginable in order to obtain social services, including Social Security Disability fraud.The list of goodies included earned income tax credits in spite of never having worked in the US, lying about not knowing English so that he could be paid to attend school rather than work, Disability, EBT, SNAP and WIC. He notes, “They’re not coming to the United States to work,” which would be bad enough in displacing American worker, “they’re coming to the United States to steal. Why would you want to import people like this?”Coulter replies that “Americans have no immunity to these sorts of crimes because by and large your traditional American criminal is dumb, commits obvious crimes, leaves evidence all over, we understand the motive, it’s usually some crap-ass motive about some petty amount. But many other cultures, every single level of society is criminal. So now we’re getting smart criminals coming in, figuring out how to work the system and stealing from Medicare and Medicaid.”She says, “I mean I’m sorry but Trump is right. We don’t need Paul Ryan cutting back on Social Security and cutting back on Medicare and cutting back on Medicaid. What we need is Donald Trump to stop this dump of low-wage workers and third-world very backward cultures on the country. They’re bringing in their elderly relatives, immediately going on Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid.”Coulter adds, “And also, an awful lot of them, more than our native born, are committing massive fraud.” It’s worth noting that as incredible as the numbers and the abuse is at present, Clinton is on the record as wanting to increase Islamic imports by 550\% and legalize anyone who wanders across our border. She might was well be shouting “Death To America.”https://soundcloud.com/rightwingwatch/coulter-immigrants-come-from-cultures-where-every-single-level-of-society-is-criminal',fake
'Harmanpreet Kaur created history on Thursday for Indian cricket when she scored an unbeaten 171 runs from 115 balls with 20 fours and seven sixes coming in her rapid fire inning that thumped the Australian attack. The knock gave immense happiness to most Indians, except Bharti, who was an upcoming badminton player. Her parents shifted her to cricket today morning and her dream of becoming a top notch badminton player vanished in a span of  minutes.Bharti, who is 14 years old, was never into sports as a child. But PV Sindhu’s silver medal at the Olympics changed her life. Her parents admitted her into a badminton academy in Hyderabad with the hope that one day she will also emulate Sindhu. Bharti always dreamed of becoming a doctor, but then who cares about a child’s dream in India. Bharti’s parents were continuously glued to news channels on the day of Sindhu’s victory and learnt that there are some good academies in India. That is when they admitted Bharti into one of them, in the next morning. Though not her area of interest, Bharti had started to take liking for the game and her game was developing pretty well.But Harmanpreet’s magical knock yesterday changed everything. Bharti’s parents heard many neighbors who were discussing about putting their daughters into cricket academies. Then what, a seat at a cricket academy in Hyderabad was booked and Bharti was shifted there overnight. Bharti who has never played cricket before in her life, found it difficult to understand the game, but is giving her best to live her parents’s dream of making her an elite cricketer, only until another female athlete wins something big in some other sport.In fact no of academies giving coaching to budding female talent has increased overnight and that is not such a great news for Badminton.',fake
'Groping: The house of cards that is the multiple coordinated lies and smears of the mainstream media in support of Hillary Clinton against Donald Trump is starting to list to one side, First a witness showed up who remembered the groping encounter from the 80s stating there was no kissing or any other type of physical interaction, in spite of Ms. Leeds’ best efforts to initiate one.Now considerable doubt has been cast upon the unsubstantiated assertions of Summer Zervos, who claimed that Mr. Trump was groping and kissed her in a hotel during a 2007 interview. Mr. Trump contends strongly that no meeting ever took place and revelations by a family member now seem to support his position. Ms. Zervos looks more like she had her feelings hurt over Trumps lack of attention in her than her sensibilities hurt by his excess interest.Zervos’ cousin, John Barry of Mission Viejo, CA, said he believes Zervos is acting vindictively. He issued a statement saying, “I am completely shocked and bewildered by my cousin, Summer Zervos, and her press conference today. Ever since she was on The Apprentice she has had nothing but glowing things to say about Mr. Trump.”He said that Zervos often described Mr. Trump as an inspiration to her professionally and that she had “converted her friends and our family to become Trump supporters.” He pinpoints the time things changed as coinciding with his rejecting her request to visit her restaurant. He said, “That was until Summer invited Mr. Trump to her restaurant during the primary and he said no. I think Summer wishes she could still be on reality TV, and in an effort to get that back she’s saying all of these negative things about Mr. Trump.”He added, “That’s not how she talked about him before. I can only imagine that Summer’s actions today are nothing more than an attempt to regain the spotlight at Mr. Trump’s expense, and I don’t think it reflects well.”The Trump campaign also released a copy of an email Zervos sent to Mr. Trump’s secretary in April of this year in which she is attempting to contact him in hopes of reconnecting, noting how popular he is in her area of California and stating that her “intentions are genuine.”   Genuine intentions also come in a nuthouse crazy, extra crazy and a genuine gold-digger variety, which seem like the categories she fits into. Genuine celebrity stalker is a possibility as well. She’s not believable and she’s really not that good of an actress. As a salesperson she was unimpressive, failing to sell the whole he groped me narrative. Her hand to her chest, catching her breath and other momentary displays of dealing with her “raw victim hood emotions” were overdone. Has she tried singing or dancing?The letter she sent to Trump’s office on April 21st has the appearance of the reactions of a jilted and disappointed woman who had delusions of something that didn’t exist and had no chance of existing. Having come to that realization and feeling spurned, a setup letter with an offer to “clear the air” and the prospect of later acting upon it, on behalf of his opponents is quite possible. Trump didn’t take the bait but they rolled out a version of the operation anyway. Progressives plan things in great detail, well in advance. We’d be naive to think that this type of attack wouldn’t be planned and implemented, ready for roll out if necessary.In launching her initial attack, Zervos said, “I contacted his secretary in April of 2016 and asked if I could reconnect with Mr. Trump. I did not tell her why I wanted to speak with him. She responded that perhaps his campaign team would follow up with me. I then wrote his assistant an email on April 21, 2016, asking her to send my email directly to Mr. Trump.That would be the setup, plan B, since he didn’t take the bait on the first attempt. She said, “In that email, I stated, ‘Your interest in me as a potential employee meant the world to me. Your interest in me as anything more blew my mind, and I lost my footing.’ I further said, ‘I have been incredibly hurt by our previous interaction.’ I ended by stating, ‘I hope to hear from you and wish you continued success.’ Mr. Trump did not reply.”Trump issued a statement earlier stating that he vaguely remembered Zervos from when she was on “The Apprentice,” but they never met at a hotel. He said, “That is not who I am as a person, and it is not how I’ve conducted my life.” He accused the media of creating a “theater of absurdity.”No one really cares outside of the Clinton media if Trump kissed a woman who came to his hotel room. She went there of her own accord and whatever happened there was between them. No criminal complaint was filed and her behavior indicated that nothing happened. If she’s the big girl she presented herself as on the television show she’d have done a much better job of selling the news conference and also would have an idea of what happens in hotel rooms. Whether she actually visited him or not is irrelevant.We’ve got a country to save; let’s move on.

'Outgoing chairman of Tata Sons, Cyrus Mistry, who was ousted from his position a few days ago has claimed that the increasing intolerance in the country was the reason he was fired.In an exclusive interview with The Unreal Times, Mistry explains to us in detail about his sacking.“It’s all because of the rising intolerance levels in the country. People have become intolerant of the success of others. People are so intolerant that they can’t even tolerate winning their own award and are giving it back. Tell me, when people are returning their awards due to intolerance, isn’t it obvious that Ratan sir will return to his old post? India is so intolerant that they can’t see someone outside the family taking charge of the organisation,” he said, sipping on a cup of Tata Coffee.“There is so much intolerance that there is no job security,” he went on to add. “I should have listened to people and taken a Government job. Now I’m too old for that too. Isn’t this also a form of intolerance? Where we don’t allow a 48 year old man to join a bank as a clerk?”When asked what he planned to do, he said that he’d return something in protest.“Since the only thing I can return right now is to return to my old job, so I will go back to Shapoorji Pallonji for now.

'Ousted Chairman of Tata Sons Cyrus Mistry today joined the Aam Aadmi Party. Speaking to the media Cyrus Mistry said, “The media, government, regulators or politicians, no one is supporting me in fighting against the injustice I have faced. Kejriwalji is my only hope. So I joined the AAP.”Speaking at the occasion, AAP supremo and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal said, “Having worked at Tata Steel several years ago, I have firsthand experience of how the board of directors of Tata Sons did not allow me to work. That is the reason I quit Tata Steel.”“Just like Cyrus Mistry, I also took up the top job in Delhi because there were no other suitable candidate. I empathize with Cyrus Mistry when he says that Ratan Tata did not allow him to do work. In a similar way, Narendra Modi and Najeeb Jung do not allow me to do work in Delhi,” he added.“Why should someone be fired for choosing to close loss making UK Steel business? First take care of Indians before subsidizing British citizens. Ratan Tata is a British agent. Even AAP does not fire its leaders so fast,” he declaredMeanwhile, our correspondent overheard this discussion between Cyrus Mistry and Rajdeep Sardesai.Rajdeep Sardesai: So what I understand Mr. Mistry is that you are concerned about the rising intolerance by the majority against the minorities in India?”Cyrus Mistry: No, I only said that I am concerned about the rising intolerance of the majority shareholders in Tata Sons against minority shareholders like me.Meanwhile, AAP leader Ashutosh took to Twitter to blast Tata Sons.“As per Cyrus Mistry, Tata Motors’ Nano plant in Gujarat is making losses. Even industrialists in Gujarat are losing money. Is this the Gujarat Model? Will Modi answer?” he tweeted.“Cyrus Mistry spoke about risk of impairment in Tata Steal? Will Ratan Tata answer?” read his second tweet.“Why was Cyrus Mistry not given a free hand to run Tata Suns? Will the Bored answer?” said his third tweetA source who did not wish to be identified told our correspondent that Tata Sons is also planning to fire Cyrus Mistry from the board of directors and has already found his replacement.After Ratan Tata asked for a versatile candidate with expertise in several fields and who is not afraid to speak his mind, a consultant suggested the name of Justice Katju. But Ratan Tata was not pleased at the prospect of being called an idiot in a board meeting and so vetoed the proposal. Instead Congress leader Ahmed Patel will be filling this post.According to our source, the Tata Sons board was very impressed with Ahmed Patel after he told them that rather than abrupt firing, they should have kept planting stories in the media like “Ratan Tata unhappy with Cyrus Mistry’s decision to close down Tata Steel UK Business.”This along with his ability to effectively manage a family trust and also manage a professional CEO without letting him drift from the group’s ethos and culture earned him a board seat.Further, according to our source, several names came up during the latest board meeting to pick a new Chairman. Ahmed Patel suggested the name of Dr. Manmohan Singh but Ratan Tata vetoed it saying he wanted a person who could be a brand ambassador for the Tata Group.Currently, there are 2 persons who are front-runners in the race for Chairman. One is Arvind Kejriwal. Several board members think that he will be a suitable candidate because he can just give speeches, visit offices and be a brand ambassador while the actual work could be left to the board.Another name doing the round is Chetan Bhagat. Given his IIT, IIM qualifications along with his versatile persona of being an author, columnist, screenwriter, television personality and motivational speaker, several board members think he is the perfect candidate for the heavily diversified salt to software conglomerate. Further, he is good with numbers, an area the Tata Group is struggling at this point in time.',fake
'Deposed chairman of Tata Group, Cyrus Mistry, has hit upon a great idea to get back his job.

Sharma-Mistry said that the emotional atyachar at Tata Sons was irking him, but then he met an inspired god man from Chennai, Cheeni Mama, who gave him guidance.Mr Sharma-Mistry is now considering building a temple for Cheeni Mama. “After all, our organization is known for its charitable acts, and in TN it is accepted practice to build a temple for actors, so this is very well in line with our organizational ethos,” Sharma-Mistry was quoted as saying.(Submitted by Citizen Satirist Badri Narayanan)',fake
'Former Secret Service Agent Dan Bongino is interviewed regarding the information that is leaking out about the violations of protocol, both generally, diplomatically and in matters related to security by Hillary Clinton, particularly as it relates to the Secret Service.The conversation began with Martha MacCallum noting that there are now revelations that a former Secret Service agent of Bill Clinton’s worked as one of Hillary Clinton’s illegal bootleg server IT guys. That’s an interesting arrangement since he was certainly aware that what he was doing was illegal.\r\nDan Bongino says that he’s been told may agents on the inside that are sources for him that they view Hillary Clinton as a “very unique threat to our republic,” and that is the motivation for many of the whistleblowers who are now coming forward.He says that it is because of the threat that she poses that their Omerta, the code of silence is now not being observed to the degree it has been previously. He says, “And this story about an agent being used to assist with Clinton Foundation server issues, security issues, which is totally against the rules for the Secret Service, I’m pretty confident I know who the agent is, is totally unsurprising to me. And I’ll bet there’s a lot more there that’s not being said, I’m reasonably confident of that as well, based upon some stories I’ve heard about what actually happened over there.”They raise the issue revealed in released FBI documents, a complaint that Clinton would boot her security detail and diplomats she was meeting with from her limousine in order to make room for Huma Abedin. The report stated, “This frequently resulted in complaints by ambassadors who were insulted and embarrassed by this breach of protocol.” It stated that one individual, whose name was redacted, explained, “Clinton’s treatment of DS agents on her protective detail was so contemptuous that many of them sought reassignment or employment elsewhere.”Dan Bongino points out that this is relative for several reasons, including the fact that it “fits in with the larger narrative of Hillary Clinton. Her elitist snob attitude towards the military and towards her Secret Service agents, which was pretty pervasive during my time with her, it  parlays into this elitist attitude towards government too that the rules don’t apply to her.”Mr. Bongino describes the incident that she just described as “a major slap in the face.” He elaborates, saying, “They have a protocol chief in the State Department who strictly handles things like this. This is a major embarrassment on a foreign trip for her not to do this and to be seen separated in the motorcade from the leader of the country she’s been invited to.”“But Martha again,” Bongino reminds his host, “she’s an elitist, she acts like a snob, she treats people terribly, and she doesn’t care about your feelings, or frankly, any protocol rules the government has. It doesn’t matter. It’s all about Mrs. Clinton all the time. She doesn’t care. And she treated female agents terribly too, which I find ironic because she says there’s a war on women, yeah there was a war on women in the Secret Service, she waged it. She was really terrible and I guarantee you there will be more people starting to talk about it.”McCallum bails Clinton out, saying, “Wow, strong charges across the board and I know that you have personal experience to back up your opinion, here.” He’s asked about the feelings of agents about potentially having to protect her again. Bongino says, “Martha, there are agents and uniformed division officers that are deathly afraid of this woman.”He says, “This woman has to be kept out of the White House. She views government as a tool for her own personal ambitions, that is it. Public service means absolutely zero to the Clintons and especially to Hillary Clinton, she’s very dangerous.Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'Any time Hillary Clinton gets behind a podium and starts to speak, something weird happens.  She takes on this faraway look like she’s listening to a conversation somewhere else, gets distracted and then starts to say things that make absolutely no sense.During 2016 presidential election debate three at the University of Nevada Las Vegas, she had yet another of these episodes that invites all sorts of conspiracy theory like speculation.  Not having watched the debate, the question could have been on anything from terrorism to gun control, but it was clear she was talking about the night club shooting in Orlando, Florida.And here you thought I was going to tell you all about how treasonous it was to reveal the time from order to launch of nuclear missiles.  That’s for another post.The poster of the video, Matt Naugle, added the sound effects of the warped voice, but the point is clear: her thoughts on the matter were either not coherent, or she was waiting for what she should say from another source.  From all reports, viewers were watching for tell tail signs of cheating.  Everything from a teleprompter in the podium to an earpiece has been discussed to death on the comment boards.  All regular joe types think she was stilted and over-prepared to the point of having known the answers ahead of time.This clip, though, is the only true trainwreck where even someone who didn’t watch the whole “debate” beginning to end can tell there was an “oh, $#@!” moment that had to be covered to surface.  Yet.  There will be more coming, no doubt, like this one where all appearances that Hillary dropped an f-bomb are clear to those looking for it.Put these clips against the “upward spiral” bit where Hillary’s train of thought obviously derailed, the two or three most prominent seizure moments, and the weird facial contortions at the convention, and something is really not right.  The Democrats can deny it all they want, but, really, that little bit was a sign that all is not what it seems.',fake
'A man was brought into the Delhi Psychiatric Hospital suffering from a unique mental disorder, never before documented in the annals of psychiatry.His wife complained he keeps shouting ‘MODI…MODI…MODI’ throughout the day and even in his sleep. “We first tried to treat him at home with some Ayurvedic medicine but he reacted violently calling it Baba Ramdev’s conspiracy. I wished he just snored like normal people”, she told attending doctors. She reported that “he is increasingly aggressive and regularly fights with me, our daughter and even our pet dog whom I’ve renamed Ashu.”“He’s now stopped talking with me. Yesterday, when I asked him what he wanted for dessert, he just pointed to a word on his cap. He wanted Mango (Aam). Why didn’t he just say so? Today he sat on a Dharna outside my kitchen, wearing that cap again and started pointing his index finger at me and threatening to seek a referendum from his party on whether or not I should continue to be his wife. When I told him that it was against the Constitution to ask for a public vote on our marriage, he went berserk and started singing ‘Hum Honge Kamyaab’. And he won’t let me wash his muffler. I could go on and on with the trouble I’ve had ever since I voted…sorry…I mean ever since I married him. Delhi is stuck with him for just 4 more years but I am stuck for Life…Doctor Saheb, Please help me.”After studying numerous brain-scans of the patient, Dr. Swamy a visiting Harvard-trained Psychiatrist had this to say:“This is a classic case of deep, unfulfilled love.

'Anonymous has the goods on the Democrats, we know it has to be Democrats because they’re the crooked ones, stuffing ballots in multiple states. We’ve expected they were going to try to steal the election, in fact, it’s the only way they can take the White House. Now we’ve got proof and it’s time to invalidate the early voting in all states until we can get some real controls in place.There seem to be primarily employees or volunteers working to circumvent the system, with one or multiple blockers being used in most of the instances. It’s the same style of stacks of ballots being stuffed into the boxes being utilized in each situation. They paid attention in their Democrat workshops. This is not a cluster of individual random acts. This is obviously coordinated.In Illinois it’s two women, one blocker and one stuffer. In the next location, the first of two in Pennsylvania, the stuffer is wearing what appears to be a name badge and appears to be at a work station. That’s an apparent indicator that she and blocker, who also has on a name badge, are working or volunteering at the polling place.  In the second Pennsylvania location, three individuals, again appearing to be employees or officials, block the view of the ballot box as a fourth woman loads it up with Clinton ballots. Nobody else is paying any attention; maybe it happens so often it’s no longer noteworthy.In what Anonymous labeled as the worst incident of the video, four persons take turns stuffing boxes as fast as they can. All of these women, apparently doing their part to get that big Hillary crack into the glass ceiling at the White House, are guilty of serious crimes. They should be immediately arrested, interrogated and made to spill their guts as to who coordinated these efforts and put them up to it. If they don’t want to talk, send them away for a long time. They can share a cell or at least be in the same cell block with Hillary Clinton.We know where the word to commit these criminal acts originates, at the top of the criminal Democrat Party. Maybe all fifty states and territories can just go back to the same day voting for everyone for this election since the Democrats have completely destroyed the integrity of this system. It is not being protected and the counts cannot be trusted as legitimate, in fact, they are guaranteed to be illegitimate. Clearly their intent is to repeat these criminal acts in as many locations as many times as possible, over and over, every day until the election.UPDATE – We’ve received a possible temporary injection of relief into the mix, information is coming in that at least one of these incidents may have taken place in Russia. That’s good, if it’s true, but it is by no means a reason for us to relax. Just as is verified by the New York City Election Commissioner, election fraud is rampant and happening all the time. It is built into the system. What is happening in the video, regardless of where it is taking place, is exactly the type of systemic abuse, be it electronic or paper balloting, that we have to be guarding against. It is what the Democrats plan to subject us to. Just because these instances may have occurred elsewhere does not mean they are not happening here as well; they are. The ability to commit this type of election fraud was the motivation behind the criminal leadership at DHS wanting access to polling stations across the nation. They know the only way they can win is through cheating. Americans don’t want another criminal for president. We had better be ready to fight this and engaged, or the election will, without a doubt, be stolen and the nation destroyed.Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'George Will, your time is past.  Your methods of madness are over.  You may be able to write eloquently with words some of us wish were in our vocabularies, but with your recent comments, you have proven to red blooded Americans now known among ourselves as “deplorables” that you are a racist, elitist snob who has no idea what we out on the fruited plain face every day.  Furthermore, your stated intention to shape American conservatism in the mold it has occupied for the last few decades shows just how out of touch you really are.You see, Mr. Will, the economic policies you and your fellow “conservative” inhabitants of inside the beltway, i.e. The Swamp, have been pressing on the American people DO NOT WORK.  The whole “free trade” thing – lowering the trade barriers without other countries lowering theirs – basically turns the USA into a flea market for cheap crap from overseas, not the quality goods that our own factories used to produce which kept our money circulating within the country.  Not only that, but NOT building a wall and securing our borders leaves the whole place open to invasion from all directions.  The illegal immigrant stream of the past few years via the desert of the southwest proves that there are still people willing to risk death to come here.In addition, the middle class is dying under a confiscatory tax scheme – including Obamacare which needs to die in a bad way – and you, Mr. Will, and your fellow “conservatives” inside the beltway just don’t see it.  No, what you see is a nation of people not as one, but multiple different groups that can and should be pigeonholed for political gain.  Please, don’t deny this.  This concept was more than obvious in an interview with Brit Hume on Thursday evening.  It is in the second half of the comments in the video below, but the idea that the Trump camp of Republicans are looking JUST to expand white voters is absurd on its face.  The people attending his rallies are from every walk of life, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, American Indian.  We are ALL suffering under the current system. (Some of the statements he makes here are outright willful denial.)Tone and substance?  Mr. Will, your tone is pedantic and insulting to the people who actually are struggling to make a living under the current regime that panty waists like you refuse to call out in plain, everyday language.  One thing in your rhetoric that is VERY wrong, is that the American people ARE ANGRY, not bewildered, not confused.  And we are not just angry, we are PISSED OFF that we have been used and abused by the power hungry and greedy for their gain without us having a say.  Soft spoken strong words do NOTHING to change that.  We the American people far prefer a take charge alpha male who says what he thinks and can get the job done.  It is a skill set that is an anathema to the talking heads of Washington. (All George Will knows how to do is talk using pretty words.  His calluses come from a typewriter, not a shovel. He was born into a family of professors.)As for entitlements and increased tax revenue, it is counter-intuitive to theorists, but Ronald Reagan – a candidate and president George Will opposed – proved that LOWER taxes INCREASE REVENUES, both personal and tax, that will alleviate the deficit and eventually lead to lower entitlements as the middle and lower classes accumulate wealth and no longer need them.  Tariffs – eliminated in the U.S., anyway, by free trade – are yes, a tax, but they are the tax that makes products made in the USA, by Americans, competitive in the marketplace.  Those of us who are hand-crafters know that a handmade baby beanie, realistically, will never sell at its actual price of materials plus labor.  Not when new moms can go to Walmart and get something comparable for a third of the cost thanks to no tariff.(Sorry, but this math is not that hard, and humans throughout history have always understood economics at its most basic level without academic “experts” having to explain it.)This is a lesson in real life that inside the beltway “conservatives” refuse to learn.  It’s as if they want to be the perpetual underdog rather than actually putting the ideals they push into practice.  And that includes George Will.  The movement of conservatism is not nearly as neatly groomed and purist as the inside the beltway over educated “conservatives” want it to be.  The concepts and recognition of the smarminess of the opposition gained force thanks to a variety of information vehicles, which makes this statement featured this week on Rush Limbaugh’s show all the more egregious:WILL:  It depends partly on the size of Mr. Trump’s defeat.  If it’s a narrow defeat, that’s the worst (snickers) conceivable outcome for Republicans, because then it will be the old stab-in-the-back theory, that but for people like Paul Ryan or Ben Sasse or lesser figures like George Will, all would have been well.  Mrs. Clinton may win by four points, but well over 300 electoral votes. That would help the Republicans.  The Republican Party has to do several things.  First, it has to somehow emancipate itself from its thralldom to the indignation industry of talk radio and certain cable personalities that I think have a paralyzing effect on the party when it tries to deal with things like immigration.  Until the Republican Party gets right with minorities in this country, it’s never gonna win another presidential election.The caller who followed this segment of Rush’s show hit the nail on the head:CALLER:  Years ago, decades ago, George Will did not initially support Ronald Reagan.  And he, like so many elites, don’t understand that you don’t tell us what to think; you share what we think, and we appreciate you because you express it so eloquently, and you allow us all to know that there’s millions like us.  And another thing they don’t get is you respect us.  And that’s something that Trump and Pence do.  They respect us. They’re reaching out to people while Hillary’s calling us a bunch of deplorables, and it’s a very poor reflection on George Will and elites like John Kasich and others that they support through their words and actions.And THAT is what we deplorables recognize is the issue with George Will and the other elitist, racist snobs.  They do not respect the people that they need to keep them in power.  They do not respect our opinions, work methods or places.  They do not know what it means to have to work sixty hours a week to make ends meet, and if they do, it may well be due to lifestyle.  Most of them don’t work on their feet unless they have a standing desk.This rant could go on and on about how much of a snob George Will and the rest of the “conservative” elite are, but the exercise would be pointless.  As a deplorable, regardless of a college degree from a “Top 25” institution and experience in the arts worth another, this writer’s opinion is moot to the self-described gatekeepers of “conservatism.”  Why?  Because it stands at odds with the conservatism of the past that the guards are desperately trying to keep alive despite the American people moving on from it.  The racist pigeonholing and breaking Americans down into subgroups does not exist with deplorables.  Nothing matters other than changing laws to put Americans first and to stop the bankrupting of the people.  No, we do not have the same lifestyles, or tastes, but that doesn’t matter.  We have the same goals.',fake
'In a sure sign that the leftist media has not matured past middle school, the New York Daily News is making a to do about Eric Trump Tweeting a picture of his ballot with his vote cast for his father, Donald Trump, in the State of New York.  Please, note in the picture below just exactly how many candidates and ballot issues are shown.So, the good American reader asks, what is wrong with a son being proud to vote for his father for president.  Well, it seems that in New York State, anyway, sharing completed ballots is illegal.  And in a case of a judge being a total hard case, it was ruled last week that this includes ballots shared on social media.  (The law is over 100 years old, and a bit on the obsolete side if someone wants to violate the seal of the election booth, but it’s still on the books.)“I’m glad to see Eric Trump engaged in our valued tradition of civil disobedience by showing his ballot on the internet. However, according to the federal court what he did was illegal and he could face up to one year in jail,” said lawyer Leo Glickman, who represented voters who’d challenged the law in a federal suit.This particular law has not been invoked in decades, but there is still the possibility of the proud son having to pay a $1,000 fine for showing the world what all of us knew he would do anyway – vote for his father.The tweet in question was removed after the New York Daily News asked someone – it’s not clear from their article who – about a possible violation of law in the case.  Yeah, that’s it.  Use the letter of the law, not the spirit of it, to try and bludgeon the son of the man running for president that the mainstream media and American liberals do not want in office all for taking a selfie at his voting precinct.Time to grow up, liberals.',fake

'Akhil Bharatiya Dhobi Mahasangh has strongly criticized dragging donkeys into politics. Reacting to a report of Chhattisgarh Congress rebel MLA R.K Rai calling Rahul Gandhi a donkey, the Mahasangh’s president Shri Shyam Rajak said, “Well, I can understand politicians throwing mud at each other and calling names. And I fully empathize with Shri R.K Rai for getting upset at Congress high command. But equating Rahul ji with donkey is unacceptable. Donkeys are our bread winners. Unless we feed them they don’t enter anyone’s house and take away their meal. Yes, their IQ is a bit low but not that bad. We condemn Shri R.K Rai’s exaggerated comparison.”In a related development, PETA, the animal rights group, has threatened to sue R.K Rai for violation of animal rights. CEO of PETA India, Poorva Joshipura, in a telephonic interview with The Unreal times said, “Animals too have their right to dignity. It is a new low for donkeys to be dragged into such comparisons. We are consulting our legal team to take legal action against Mr. R.K Rai.”Mr. R.K Rai got support from unexpected quarters. Dr. Madhu Khanna Professor, at Centre for Comparative Religions at Jamia Millia Islamia staunchly defended R.K Rai. “As per Old Testament prophecy, the Messiah is said to arrive on a donkey. The prophesy came true when Jesus rode on a donkey and entered Jerusalem. In Hinduism, the goddess Kalaratri’s vehicle is a donkey. So donkeys are blessed animals. By comparing Rahul ji with a donkey, Mr Rai has only elevated Rahul ji in the spiritual realm of things.”Arvind Kejriwal too agreed with Prof Khanna. “Those who have watched ’Shrek Forever After’ will agree that donkey is such an adorable animal. Rai ji has only complemented Rahul ji,” said Kejriwal, before speeding off to special screening of ’Ae Dil Hai Mushkil’.Repeated efforts by The Unreal times to contact Rahul Gandhi’s office were not fruitful as the receptionist was not able to confirm the whereabouts of Mr Gandhi.(Reported by Citizen Satirist Sridharan Sankaran)',fake

'James O’Keefe’s Project Veritas has really done it this time. Their undercover reporting is exposing the malicious attacks on our electoral system that are a massive web of criminality employed on a daily basis targeting the American people and our rights to choose our leaders. It’s business as usual for the Democrat Party.They have revealed a sophisticated covert voter and election fraud operation that is being run illegally and immorally all across this nation by the corrupt Democrats. The security breaches that Obama, Clinton and the Democrats were “so concerned about,” the ones supposedly originating with the Russians, pale in comparison to what they are themselves doing to corrupt the electoral process.\r\nThe hacks on the DNC and Clinton are a revelation of what they were actually doing. If it’s wrong they’re responsible, don’t nuke the messenger or use it as a premise for World War lll. Excuse us if we don’t get too upset that treason by our pretend ‘president’ and his henchmen were exposed by someone. What is important is that the truth gets out, not so much who leaked it. The corruption that threatens America was in the acts of the Democrats, not in those who obtained the data. It is the Democrats who are attacking the sanctity of our electoral process.Hacks that exposed what the Democrats were already doing are nothing compared to what Project Veritas reveals here. The assaults, abuse of the process, voter intimidation, violations of the law and mass voter fraud that the Democrats are engaged in are breathtaking. They revel in being the thugs and goons, paid by George Soros with full knowledge and approval of Obama, Clinton and the rest of the Democrat leadership, who beat up innocent people attending Trump rallies. They commit identity theft, enabling multiple voting and other illegal voting. They are criminals and the organization is corrupt, top to bottom, through and through.This second video picks up where the first one left off yesterday, exposing the blatant criminality that is the Democrat Party. It will be interesting to listen for any faint rustling of a response from the media, to hear any calls for investigations into civil rights violations from the crooked cesspool that is the Department of Justice. Will either Loretta Lynch or her ACLU bulldog Vanita Gupta, now her civil rights left hand, be launching an investigation? Perhaps, a phony one, the kind that Hillary Clinton received.They will undoubtedly try to sweep this lawlessness under the same carpet with the stack of Clinton violations that they, along with FBI Director Comey, are insulating from public scrutiny. This is no surprise to most of us but it’s a great thing to have it being exposed in this manner.How much more proof do voters need to see before they understand that our government has been hijacked by criminals and that Hillary Clinton and Hussein Obama are perhaps the biggest mobsters ever to walk, slither or shuffle across the face of the earth.As one of their operatives says in the video, “they’ve been doing it for fifty years.” That’s long enough, it has to stop. Ever heard of RICO, Madam Attorney General? This is what it was enacted for – organized crime, like yours.Updated information: A Tweet from James O’Keefe indicates he’s gotten his second scalp in as many days with the thug Bob Creamer, infamously depicted in the video, now announcing he’s leaving the campaign. He claims he hasn’t done anything wrong, of course, he’s being fired for a reason. It’s not because he’s a criminal, that was why he was hired.

'Lou Dobbs describes the current campaign as the dirtiest in memory and his memory goes back all the way to 1976. That was the year a misguided public voted Jimmy Carter into office. He represented a leader whose primary “qualification” was his “pure heart,” although he was an early member of the globalist Trilateral Commission. It was a well kept secret and they were virtually unknown. It’s difficult to describe Jimmy Carter by using the “L” word, better just to call him a president.Against the backdrop of that election, Dobbs points out that more goes into the election of a president than reason and good sense in the support of our national interest. Now with 26 days remaining until the election Dobbs describes the unusual clarity about the candidates in this election, more so than in any other contest he recalls.Dobbs says, “The left wing national media, owned lock, stock and barrel by corporatists and all sorts of establishment elites, have decided in this election at least, to this point, nothing so much needs protection as their own moneyed interests and the stagnant swamp to which most Americans are consigned. That swamp of course our society and our economy. That swamp generally referred to as the status quo because the elites think that sounds a heck of a lot better than ‘stagnant swamp.\'”“But one candidate has managed to set himself apart,” says Dobbs, “running against the status quo, against the establishment, trying to drain that swamp and run the elites out of town. Trump had the courage to take on the establishment, the elites of both parties, the national media and fight like hell for the middle class working men and women and their families.”Dobbs says, “He is not only ringed by his powerful adversaries now in the final month of this contest but he has been betrayed by his miserable allies, the leaders of the Republican Party. This is a battle that can still be won by the American people and no one else.”Dobbs adds, “And if this republic is lost, we will have ourselves only to blame.”Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'Lou Dobbs has a few thoughts on the topic of the national liberal media ignoring the Clinton Cartel’s vast web of corruption in Washington DC. He notes, “Fortunately for all of us the Wall Street Journal is still in the news business and today we learned that top Clinton ally, Governor Terry McAuliffe, gave $467,000 in campaign contributions to the wife of an FBI official who was among those who began leading the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s email scandal.”“McAuliffe met with Dr. Jill McCabe,” Dobbs says, “in March 2015 to encourage her to run for the Virginia State Senate, the same month the Clinton email scandal emerged.” Dobbs describes it as “Purely coincidental, I’m sure, and I’m sure the Clintons have more coincidences in their lives than any hundred married couples anywhere in the world.”“The lives and work of the Clintons and Governor McAuliffe,” says Dobbs, “have intersected throughout the last three decades. McAuliffe authored the infamous Lincoln Bedroom memo back in 1995. A straight tradeoff offering White House access to top donors. A quid pro quo scheme that raised a lot of money. Governor McAuliffe guaranteed the mortgage on the Clinton’s Chappaqua home. He did that back in 1999. He launched an electric car company, Green Tech before he was elected governor. The company was granted special access in securing visas by the federal government.”Dobbs points out, “McAuliffe even received help from a firm run by Tony Rodham. That’s right, Hillary’s brother, who obtained foreign investors and visas. Of course the Governor himself is the subject of an FBI investigation now, over campaign contributions from a Chinese businessman who is a former delegate to China’s parliament and has permanent US resident status. How about that?”“His name is Weng Wenliang,” says Dobbs, “He gave $120,000 to McAuliffe’s 2013 campaign and, oh yes, he didn’t forget about the Clinton Foundation, $2 million dollars to the Foundation. In fact, 120 Clinton Foundation donors also contributed more than $13 million dollars to Governor McAuliffe’s campaigns. There’s the Clinton Foundation again; purely coincidental, I acknowledge.”Dobbs adds, “And it’s purely coincidental that Dr. Jill McCabe’s husband is now the number two man at the FBI, reporting to Director James Comey. Purely coincidence again.”',fake
'Lou Dobbs focuses on the prominent role the month of March has played in the Clinton email and other scandals. He calls it “The troublesome ides of March, especially March of last year. For a number of reasons that month has proven to be pivotal in the scandal over her use of a ‘private’ server to conduct official State Department business, communicating by email over that server.”\r\nHe points out that it was the New York Times that broke the email story back in March of 2015, with the latest batch of WikiLeaks emails indicating that the Clinton team has been scrambling ever since. Dobbs plays a clip of Obama lying about his knowledge of Clinton using a personal email account to conduct government business.”\r\n\r\nIn an interview Obama was asked, “Mr. ‘president,’ when did you first learn that Hillary Clinton used an email system outside the US government for official business while she was Secretary of State?” Obama responded with a blatant lie, saying, “The same time everybody else learned it through news reports.”\r\nMr. Dobbs points out the fact that “Everybody else, however, didn’t believe the ‘president’ when he said that. And Clinton’s top aide, Cheryl Mills, certainly knew better. It was she who told Podesta, ‘We need to clean this up,’ noting the ‘president’ has emails from Hillary that do not say ‘State.gov.\'”\r\n\r\nDobbs goes on to tell his audience that Clinton had just days earlier conspired with Obama to hold back emails despite being subpoenaed by Congress.

Dobbs plays a clip of Obama lying about his knowledge of Clinton using a personal email account to conduct government business.”In an interview Obama was asked, “Mr. ‘president,’ when did you first learn that Hillary Clinton used an email system outside the US government for official business while she was Secretary of State?” Obama responded with a blatant lie, saying, “The same time everybody else learned it through news reports.”Mr. Dobbs points out the fact that “Everybody else, however, didn’t believe the ‘president’ when he said that. And Clinton’s top aide, Cheryl Mills, certainly knew better. It was she who told Podesta, ‘We need to clean this up,’ noting the ‘president’ has emails from Hillary that do not say ‘State.gov.\'”\r\nDobbs goes on to tell his audience that Clinton had just days earlier conspired with Obama to hold back emails despite being subpoenaed by Congress.

'Since Donald Trump took the gloves off the liberal elites have opted to employ their own new strategy of naked betrayal. Dobbs notes the difficulty that the elites are having with Trump, now recognizing that he is truly a threat to their status quo cronyism to a much greater degree than they had earlier been willing to believe.Noting that Trump made his fortune before entering into politics rather than as a result of it, and the threat that he presents, he’s “far too close for further laxity among the elites. They are taking him now seriously, so seriously they mean to seriously kill his candidacy outright. And that’s why Donald Trump is fighting an all but impossible to win war on three fronts.”Dobbs describes how Speaker Paul Ryan, “Today chose to betray millions of Trump voters and supporters, abandon any common sense it seems he might possess, and turn his back on his party’s presidential nominee. Ryan telling House Republicans that he will not defend nor campaign with Trump, telling lawmakers to “do what’s best for you in your district.”“Not only is Ryan’s behavior puerile and selfish, we’re getting kind of use to that, his intellect betrays him on the occasions that he does try to employ it.” Dobbs says, “He seems hellbound to destroy the Republican Party, Trump’s candidacy and now the majority in the House. Ryan appears to have absolutely no concept of the power of unity, his responsibility as Speaker, the institutional importance of his party and duty to the nation.”“He is a laughing stock leader,” says Dobbs, “a small man dressed up in a big job, capable of only the dreariest clichés and the forlorn looks of earnest mediocrity to which he can seldom rise. At least forty Republicans in Congress have denounced Trump now. Oh, I’m sure Donald Trump tonight is shaken as they pull their support or ask him to step aside after his hot mic comments from eleven years ago.”Dobbs describes the duplicitous politicians as being led by the treasonous Ryan from sure victories in the House, and likely the Senate and White House to possible defeat, sanctimony and cowardice. Their constituents, he says, “should be voting them out of office. And Ryan should no more be the Speaker of the House than Hillary Clinton should be president of the United States. And make no mistake, the futures of those two are intertwined.”Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'General Dogla Karamati, Chief  of ISI or Invertebrate Services Incorporated was sitting in his plush chamber guzzling wine and chewing on cherries when his deputy Pareshaan Harkat entered.“General Sir, Burhan Bunny has been killed by the Indian Security forces.”The General who had been watching a video of  Sunny Leone tore his eyes from the TV and snapped. “Who the jahannum is Bunny?”“Don’t you remember Sir? he was among the latest batch of recruits trained by us and sent to India-Occupied-Pakistan or IOP to unleash mayhem.”“Come on, how do you expect me remember one individual. Over the last two decades, our militant organisations have been mentoring and releasing thousands of would be martyrs in IOP.”“But sir, this boy was special.”“Why?”“In the practical exam he had topped among more than 1000 competitors, and you yourself had given him a special medal –Jalladey Pakistan!”“What kind of exam was that?”“For each of the contestants we had put one Baluchi on the starting line, and asked the prey to crawl a distance of 25 meters. Each participant had to fire 5 shots standing at the finishing line – the first shot was  to dismember the left hand of the quarry,  the second the right hand, the third and fourth the knees and the last bullet was to land between the eyes. The earlier one could complete the task the more number of points he got. Bunny got his Balcuchi in all the right spots within five meters of the starting line. No other contestant could manage a perfect score even after their respective Baluchis had wriggled the entire distance.”“Oh, Yes! Now I remember, brilliant fellow!”“What now Sir ?”“Let us capitalize on Bunny’s death. It is an ‘Osama’ sent opportunity. Ask our twin-brothers in arms in IOP to whip up a frenzy. Direct our experts to create a viral tsunami on the social media.  Let our activists in IOP get the young and restless out on the streets in support of Bunny. Our boys should simply foment unrest and then disappear and leave the dying to the Indians. And make sure the international media gets a ring side view of the happenings.”“That should not be a problem, Sir. We have the entire mechanism in place. One ‘martyrdom’ in IOP and our entire terror assembly line gets rolling.”“Great. Now the next step would be to take the issue to the U.N. Earlier, the USA would automatically join forces with us. But of late they have started cold shouldering our country. But never mind, my   counterpart in the Chinese establishment I-speak-lie will back us to the hilt.”“That’s true Sir. All thanks to your proactive planning and strategic implementation.”“I know, I know,” Dogla said chucking a cherry at the grateful Pareshaan.“Now, Pareshaan, I had asked you to prepare a new rate card for our suicide bombers, is it ready?”“Of course Sir!”“Read it out.”“A suicide bomber who loses his right or left arm gets 1 lakh. One who loses his right or left leg is given 2 lakhs. The family of a martyr gets Rs. 10 lakhs.”“Abey Khachhar! Didn’t I tell you to add an incentive for the deaths caused?”“Sorry Sir! I was just coming to that. For every person killed by him, our suicide bomber will get Rs. 10,000/-.”“Good! Dogla khush hua!”“Anything else, Sir?”“Yes, our country will observe 19th July as Martyr’s Day.”“That’s a wonderful idea, Sir! How will we ‘celebrate’ it, Sir?”',fake

'VARANASI:  On his first visit to Varanasi after his party’s over sized victory in the Uttar Pradesh elections earlier this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will head back to his parliamentary constituency today. Though it is a big occasion for PM Modi, it has created havoc in the election commission office. Most of the officers are checking if there is an election anytime soon in Varanasi and whether they have missed out marking the dates in their calendar.PM Modi, 67, had camped for three days in the holy city in March that helped give the BJP 312 of the 403 seats, the biggest majority for any party in Uttar Pradesh since 1977.But after March this is the first visit by the PM, which makes people think that he only visits during election time. People in Varanasi were seen asking each other if there is any election planned for the up coming days. PMO has installed posters at every corner of the city assuring that there is no election in the upcoming days and PM’s visit is only for inaugurating many infrastructure projects in the pious town. Modi Ji has promised that he will not talk about his achievements in the past 3 years and will not ask for votes for which people were afraid of.Yogi Adityanath has ordered the civic work department to carry out major cleanliness drive for the PM’s visit. He is even sure that just like the PM did in Gujarat, he may announce some big initiatives for U.P, something on the lines of Metro, or river front or a big factory. PMO has also kept its ears wide open about any new announcement of the PM in Varanasi as they are the ones who have to implement what the PM promises in his constituency.',fake
'Election fraud in the United States is a fact of life. The mainstream media may deny it, and claim that no case has ever been proven, but eyewitness accounts tell us that this is the case.  Not only that, but more then one election had an outcome that so differed from empirical rally and enthusiasm evidence, that claims of candidates being robbed are considered to be probable, but unprovable.  Until now.In a year that has given us one leak and undercover video after another exposing collusion in media messaging between one major political party and those who disseminate information, yet another brave American by the name of Bev Harris tried her darndest to go undercover and bring Americans a view of what happens behind the scenes at election headquarters in various counties, specifically in Tennessee.  Bottom line: cameras are NOT ALLOWED in where computers that count the votes are kept.  Public access to the process is strictly controlled leaving all sorts of room for election fraud as there are no neutral eyes on the counting.To make matters more obscene, the software that came with all the newfangled voting machines has now gone commercial.  Harris’s website, Black Box Voting, has a good explanation, but for a demonstration, check out this video.  Yes, it’s long, but the viewer can watch how votes can be manipulated in real time.For those out there who thought that every vote is counted…sorry to disappoint, but it looks like election fraud is starting to be mainstreamed with computers and a simple percentage formula like one would make up for an Excel spreadsheet.  Considering the number of states where this software is used…look out.This video, showing that the manipulation can be at the precinct level, does lend credence to something Karl Rove and other professional politicos have to say: it only takes a handful of precincts to flip an election.  The fraction action is done by precinct.  Just like election returns are reported.  (Can you say RIGGED?)If ever there was a demonstration of why we should be using paper ballots and they should be counted in full view of the public and live streamed to constituents, this is it.  Losing an election is palatable if the count is honest.  This level of election fraud, on the other hand, is beyond maddening.Additional analysis from Alex Jones available here.',fake
'The Texas Director of Elections has something to hide. It appears there is something that he doesn’t want the American people and the people of Texas to know about their votes. David Knight of Infowars just wanted to ask this supposed public servant why he’s adopted a policy that seems to be designed to embrace voter fraud, to compromise the integrity of the election process rather than to protect or ensure it.\r\nAs Keith Ingram was heading downstairs he made it most of the way, lacking only one flight of steps of being there. That’s when he saw trouble lurking in his path, those notorious Infowars guys were “after him” again. What’s a corrupt politician to do when he confronted by honest media with nowhere to hide? There was only one solution, the last result of compromised global lackey politicians. Ingram ran the other way. He turned tail like a cowardly elementary school kid who sees the bully is waiting for him after school.\r\n\r\nAs the cowardly and compromised official made a run for it, Knight asked him, “You don’t want to talk to us?” Ingram indicated that the in fact did not. Knight asked him again, “Really, you don’t want to talk to us at all? People are concerned the election’s going to be rigged, I guess they’re really going to be concerned when they see you turn your back on us.”\r\nHe asks if he can talk to anyone, or if they all “want to rig this.” He shouts out his question to the runaway official, asking, “Why are you cutting off all of these audit trails? Why are you cutting down the paper audit trails?” This political appointee who had no experience in managing elections before being given the job previously worked as a political appointment to Governor Rick Perry. His area of expertise was in the unrelated field of routine legal work and the selection of political appointees.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Ingram is sensitive about his lack of qualifications for his job and afraid he might look bad in trying to justify his errant decisions. Perhaps he’s they simply can’t be justified and he knows it. Knight says, “Well, there you go. That should tell you something. People concerned about elections being rigged, you’ve got the Director of Elections here in the Secretary of State’s office that won’t talk to us. He takes one look at the press and turns around an walks off.”\r\nKnight notes in the video that it was his intention to ask Ingram “why there have been so many orders to contravene the law that would give us an audit trail for electronic voting machines.” He points out the concerns of the American people over the integrity of our electoral process and notes that “We’ve seen time and time again that the director here of elections has judged in favor of the vendors rather than in favor of integrity.”\r\nKnight says, “If the vendor’s machines that he wants to buy don’t conform to election law they change the election laws. So we want to ask him why he’s shutting down paper trails at the different precincts, why they are turning away monitors at the elections and other issues about electronic voting that many people are concerned about. It is a nationwide concern and we’re going to ask him what he can tell us to reassure voters that these elections are not rigged.\r\n\r\nRather than offer reassurances, Ingram increased our concerns, indicating that he can’t explain his actions and that they may well have been done specifically with the intent to manipulate the results. He’s supposed to be a public servant, apparently that doesn’t include nosey reporters trying to inform the American people. In those cases he feels justified in running and hiding.

'According to sources, Republic TV has become a new addiction among people. Its 24 hours Exclusive news is not allowing anyone to leave their seat. Mr. Chandan, who works as a content writer in Buzzpoop, had taken a week’s leave when Republic was aired for the first time. He has now asked his office canteen in-charge to resign after he refused to play Republic TV during lunch hours.Faking News reporter spoke to Chandan, who said, “Republic has done what no other channel has ever done; it shows Exclusive news even at midnight. The fearless attack on opposition has never been done by anyone else. All other news channels target only the incumbent government. I had an altercation with my office canteen in charge and I have no regrets. I have learned debating skills from Arnab and I am glad that I got the chance to use them.”It’s not even a month and Arnab’s Republic TV has gained maximum TRP. BARC data shows that Republic TV has captured 52\% market share in just a week’s time. Journalist-turned-boxer, Rajdeep Sardesai has called BARC sold out. Arnab took a jibe at Sardesai and called his statement an irony. Arnab later conducted a prime time debate on Rajdeep Sardesai’s statement “BARC sold out” with 30 panelists. Hashtag for the debate was #RajdeepAuctionedCM Arvind Kejriwal has also accused Arnab for tempering with the BARC Data. Kejriwal questioned, “A few days back NDTV allegedly claimed to have the highest TRP among all the news channels then how come Republic TV became the number 1 channel?”What Chandan has demanded is certainly not correct, but “allegedly” sold out news media houses have certainly raised a valid question. Which channel to show in office canteen and at various public places as news channels affect people’s perception. ',fake
'Chennai. Indian Society of Otology, comprising of thousands of ENT surgeons across India, cheers and welcomes the launch of REPUBLIC TV, the Secretary of the association told Faking News. The new news channel to bring direct revenue to most of the member doctors in the society, he added.“Ever since Arnab left Times now, our business had seen a lull period. The channel used to supply direct customers (ethically referred to as patients) from the studios and indirect customers from across the country, watching the channel. Some of us even kept our clinics open in the night, due to the customers seeking our help, immediately after the news hour debates in the night,” the Secretary told Faking News.“As an association, we are never interested in who gets exposed in the channel. On the launch day, Lalu got exposed by REPUBLIC TV. We cared the least. What we are interesting in is about the number of potential patients who are voluntarily exposed to the harmful decibel levels broadcasted across the nation. In fact, we started measuring the decibel levels with reference to the units of TV channel names,” he confirmed.“With the launch of REPUBLIC, a new unit for sound is approved by our association. The unit is named after the new channel and will be known as Republic. Don’t be alarmed when a diagnosis sheet talks about a patient affected with 1 Republic or 1 and 1/2 Republic or 2 Republics,” the Secretary repeated the word so many times much like the news channel repeating the same words over and over again during the debates.“We don’t know if the nation wants to know or even cares to know. We, in fact, have a secret partnership with the news channel. Look at the symbol of the new channel! Almost looks like a doctor’s prescription pad symbol is it not?” the Secretary casually exposed the secret deals between the news channel and the ENT society.',fake
'This is exactly the next step we’ve expected from the Climate Nazis, forced austerity that destroys America’s standard of living and world status. They seem to be firm in the belief that the global government elites will prevail in the upcoming election, by hook or more likely by crook, and they will have four or eight more years to complete the destruction of our nation.Whatever possesses the demonic little unisex tyrant to believe that she somehow has a right and the power to dictate to “free” Americans their compliance in their own destruction is beyond reason, but she’s doing it. She’s telling some pajama supporter her propaganda as if his agreement with her green authoritarianism somehow makes it legitimate; it’s not. The forces of anti-American destruction embodied by Hussein Obama and Hillary Clinton are not our masters regardless of the excuse or false religion, such as air and dirt worship, that they attempt to use to manipulate us into compliance. That appears to be a fact that will increasingly have to be demonstrated to that for them to understand that they are not our masters; so be it.This disgusting little he-she attempts to psychoanalyze the American people as a tool of persuasion, saying, “People don’t react well when they’re afraid, they tend to think they can’t do anything.” There is nothing about you, you evil little witch, that should inspire any emotion other than disgust, anger, and an appropriate response grounded in the extreme desire to stop you. Only a useless cyber-dork like the human pimple interviewer would find trash like Gina McCarthy or those she serves something to be afraid of. She needs to fear the American people who have had all of this tyranny we’re going to take.The Butch hag says, “And climate will have to not just be what government does but it has to be what people do.” No, Climate is what God does, what the planet does, it is neither what people or the collection of people known as government do. That is the reality whether it be a national government or a corrupt and illegitimate global one. Climate hoax is also not something that the people do voluntarily, it is the result of distortion and manipulation. It is something that is forced upon them by an exploitative cabal of criminal operatives, such as McCarthy, when they are sufficiently complacent to allow themselves to be bullied into submission.\r\nIn attempting to persuade those who choose to live primitive, deprived lives in service to the climate change religion, in imposing their beliefs legislatively or by dictate upon the rest of us, McCarthy says, “Individual choices will matter.” Of course she means that only from the standpoint of those who choose obedience to the climate change theology. She adds, “Consumers can make demands. They have always done that and changed markets as a result of it.”\r\nIn instructing us to accept their austerity mandates, McCarthy says, “So people have to start living a life that’s commensurate with reductions in greenhouse gases to the extent they can.” She then seeks to bolster her illegitimate authority, saying, “But as you said, demand government to be responsive to this.” That is, tell government that we agree that we must obey unconstitutional globalist dictates. Her perception of “responsive government” is one that dictates submission to its ignorant peasants.\r\nHaving recognized that those who have figured out her lies are not going to be manipulated into obedience to her trickery, the little green Nazi demeans those who aren’t led by the nose as does the swollen basement dweller she’s using to promote her propaganda. McCarthy dismisses the self-thinkers saying, “But I would waste no time with ‘climate deniers.’ If they haven’t figured out by now, what in God’s name can anyone say to them that would make them figure it out? The science is overwhelming. I don’t check out flat earth society and I’m not talking to climate deniers, that’s it.”\r\n\r\nJust as Obama declared the “science settled” because the facts don’t match up with his declarations, McCarthy has also lost the argument. She’s not going to try to win an argument that has been exposed as fraud and is moving on to the use of brute force and lawless dictates, two Democrat favorites.\r\nThey’re going to go full totalitarian in the near future. That’s fine, two can play at that game. If Trump wins the election we’ll have our freedom from this tyranny. If not, we’ll have an enemy that has presented themselves as clearly defined and targeted.\r\nPlease like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nHow Many People Visit                                        \r\n \r\nComments In attempting to persuade those who choose to live primitive, deprived lives in service to the climate change religion, in imposing their beliefs legislatively or by dictate upon the rest of us, McCarthy says, “Individual choices will matter.” Of course she means that only from the standpoint of those who choose obedience to the climate change theology.

Her perception of “responsive government” is one that dictates submission to its ignorant peasants.Having recognized that those who have figured out her lies are not going to be manipulated into obedience to her trickery, the little green Nazi demeans those who aren’t led by the nose as does the swollen basement dweller she’s using to promote her propaganda. McCarthy dismisses the self-thinkers saying, “But I would waste no time with ‘climate deniers.’ If they haven’t figured out by now, what in God’s name can anyone say to them that would make them figure it out? The science is overwhelming. I don’t check out flat earth society and I’m not talking to climate deniers, that’s it.”\r\nJust as Obama declared the “science settled” because the facts don’t match up with his declarations, McCarthy has also lost the argument.

'Erik Prince, former Navy SEAL and founder of Blackwater, was a guest of Breitbart News Daily on Sirius FM radio Friday.  In his interview, he and host Alex Marlow started talking about the legal mess that Democratic Candidate for president, Hillary Clinton, finds herself in in relation to the hundreds of thousands of emails found on former Congressman Anthony Weiner’s laptop, and Prince dropped a bombshell:…according to one of his “well-placed sources” in the New York Police Department, “The NYPD wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were making” in the Anthony Weiner investigation, but received “huge pushback” from the Justice Department.Prince then went on to elaborate on what his sources tell him is going on behind the scenes.“Because of Weinergate and the sexting scandal, the NYPD started investigating it. Through a subpoena, through a warrant, they searched his laptop, and sure enough, found those 650,000 emails. They found way more stuff than just more information pertaining to the inappropriate sexting the guy was doing,” Prince claimed.“They found State Department emails. They found a lot of other really damning criminal information, including money laundering, including the fact that Hillary went to this sex island with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Bill Clinton went there more than 20 times. Hillary Clinton went there at least six times,” he said.“The amount of garbage that they found in these emails, of criminal activity by Hillary, by her immediate circle, and even by other Democratic members of Congress was so disgusting they gave it to the FBI, and they said, ‘We’re going to go public with this if you don’t reopen the investigation and you don’t do the right thing with timely indictments,’” Prince explained.“I believe – I know, and this is from a very well-placed source of mine at 1PP, One Police Plaza in New York – the NYPD wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were making in this investigation, and they’ve gotten huge pushback, to the point of coercion, from the Justice Department, with the Justice Department threatening to charge someone that had been unrelated in the accidental heart attack death of Eric Garner almost two years ago. That’s the level of pushback the Obama Justice Department is doing against actually seeking justice in the email and other related criminal matters,” Prince said.The full interview, available at Breitbart, goes into further detail about the entire affair including that New York Mayor Bill De Blasio wants to distance himself from the entire thing, and that Hillary Clinton and her aides are under investigation by multiple offices in the FBI.  The New York Police Department, at this time, still apparently has a copy of the Weiner notebook computer files.  However, it is not the FBI doing the obstructing, it is the Justice Department.That tidbit of information is quite telling.',fake
'New Delhi: A research study conducted by a leading institute has revealed that even the cows in the country are fed up of the non-stop cow and beef stories in the media for the past 3 years. Cow has become an integral part of Indian politics ever since BJP led NDA came to power in May 2014. Indian media, as always focused on the major issues, has covered this cow politics angle extensively. In fact they covered this cow politics so seriously that for the first time in Indian history, a news from Meghalaya made national news.Expressing their frustration, a representative of the Indian Cows Association said ,”I don’t know man, cover the economy or foreign affairs or national security or even some baba, they are still around, but please leave us alone. Every time we switch on the TV or open a newspaper, it is Gaurakshaks or beef or cow slaughter, what is this?”Furthermore, the angry cow added ,”It wasn’t always like this. There were beef bans in several states in the past, cow slaughter was also banned in some places, but nobody cared. We were living a content life. However, since this Modi came to power, all our privacy has been lost. Every cow has 4 news cameras focused on it as every reporter waits with bated breath for something to happen around us. There is simply no escape from this media attention, I don’t know how Virat Kohlis and SRKs of this world live with all this media attention. it is simply too much for us.”When asked if they will boycott news channels completely if they don’t leave cows alone, the cow said ,”We can avoid the TV channels but what to do about newspapers. People offer us roti on a plate made of a newspaper only. It is impossible to keep our eyes off the news while eating. it is a nightmare.”As per our sources inside Cows Association, many cows are now planning to sit in the middle of the road outside all media offices to register their protest.',fake

'How many times has it happened that you saw a lame joke on Facebook or check-ins of your best friend enjoying in Europe without you or photos of your Ex getting married and you wished you could just slap them hard?Well, attention all Facebook users! Your wish is about to come true. Very soon, Facebook is going to launch a ‘slap’ reaction for posts. Yes, you read it right! And that’s not it. It will even send an executive to slap someone if number of slaps on their post crosses 100.Last Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg unveiled the details of this new feature in a press conference. He stated, “Since quite a long time, people were asking us to add a reaction that would express their true feelings. Now, we all know that a ‘like’ or a ‘heart’ on our colleague’s ‘Got promoted’ post is more artificial than these flowers” as he points to the fake flowers kept on the table.“So we have finally decided to come up with a ‘slap’ reaction. Users can now slap anyone on Facebook and that too for any reason. Don’t like a status? Slap the person. Envious of vacation photos? Slap everyone who went there. Depressed about your crush getting married? Slap their spouse. You see we’re trying to bring people more close than ever.”But this was not it. He further added, “But this is not it. There’s a catch to this. If the no. of slaps on a post crosses 100, Facebook would send an executive to slap the person, wherever he or she is”. Yes, even we’re boggled by this amazing technology.When asked about the feasibility and cost involved with this new feature, he added, “See, by hiring executives for slapping people, or as we call them – Slapchatters, yes this is an original name, we are basically increasing the employment. We have appointed Dayanand Shetty (a.k.a. Daya of CID fame) as our Chief of Staff for Slapchatters. He will be personally teaching each and every Slapchatter, the basics of slapping.”He explained the technology with an example, “Suppose you bail out on your friends for a dinner plan citing you’re ill. And just hours later you check-in at a location with your girlfriend. Obviously, all of your friends will slap you for your check-in. And if the anger is so high that the slap counter crosses 100, the waiter at your location will slap you. Yes, we have tied up with many restaurants for this.”This feature is hands down the best feature Facebook has ever had. So grab your gear and get ready to spread some slappiness!',fake

'New York- A shocking number that raises question over misplaced priorities of humans, a latest research revealed today that overall PR budget of entire planet earth crossed  a whopping $400B last year. This means, earth spent more money than its entire health, food and education budget combined to improve its image in the solar system and beyond.It’s not yet clear who our planet wanted to impress, but experts say it was necessary considering rapidly falling habitabilty on this plant, that, if known to outside worlds, would be enough to discourage any alien interest in settling down here, lowering our self esteem and hurting our ego.When asked if that much amount could have better spent improving condition back here, so the PR wasn’t required in the first place, the expert replied- the damages we’re doing to earth are unjustifiable, irreversible and an ‘evil necessity’, hence the only option left for us is to publicize to outside worlds that we’re not actually doing those terrible things. They just happen on their own.',fake
'You may have heard of parents sending their kids to boarding school to teach them discipline or to make them independent or other personal reasons. But what happened with Parthiv Gupta, a 16-year old kid, will astonish you. Parthiv’s father, Mr. Rajesh Gupta, has sent him to boarding school for removing plastic cover of their TV remote. Yes, you read it right!Rajesh’s neighbor, Mr. Sanjay Sharma, called us to narrate the incident hoping that media spotlight would make Rajesh change his decision. We interviewed Rajesh and here’s what he had to say.  “Before you judge me or label me as a strict father or give me names such as Hitler Qureshi or tell me to watch movies like Taare Zameen Par and 3 idiots, I would like to say that we are middle class people. Not upper middle class. Not lower middle class. We’re the exact middle of middle class. We are so middle class that we are using belan (rolling pin used in kitchen) since last 20 days to remove paste. We live on 3 things – food, water and EMIs. My son Parthiv very well knows that most of the things we have in the house are second hand. And if there is something that is new, we first worship it for at least 6 months and try to keep it as new as possible for however long we can,” he said. “Just 2 months ago, we bought a new TV after saving for 10 months. And when I came home 3 days ago, I was stunned to see that Parthiv had removed the cover of the TV remote. You go and ask any middle-class family what the remote cover means to them. It is sacred for us. Parthiv clearly lacks the basic fundamentals of a middle class family so I have sent him to an affordable boarding school where they’ll teach him how to value things such as remote covers. So if you want to call me names I’m fine with it, but it is for my son’s own good,” he added.This is when our reporter accidentally broke a glass kept on the table. Mr. Rajesh transformed into a hulk and we had to leave before he could grab us.',fake
'In the world of American jurisprudence sometimes the discovery method is just as unsavory as the madness.  In the case of the FBI taking down the child pornography (porn) website Playpen, the way law enforcement went about finding out who the USERS of the site were really is hard to swallow.  They went to a federal magistrate judge in Virginia and got permission to get into Playpen, a site hidden on the dark web via a system known as Tor, and use it for a bit (13 days) to plant malware on subscribers’ computers.  The malware in question sends identification data and computer addresses then to law enforcement.That worked so well, the boys in blue went to ANOTHER magistrate in Maryland and got control of at least 20 more sites according to documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union.In the normal course of the operation of a web site, a user sends “request data” to the web site in order to access that site. While Websites 1-23 operate at a government facility, such request data associated with a user’s actions on Websites 1-23 will be collected. That data collection is not a function of the NIT. Such request data can be paired with data collected by the NIT, however, in order to attempt to identify a particular user and to determine that particular user’s actions on Websites 1-23.There was just one problem with that method of catching not just the producers of child porn, but the consumers.  It’s an eensy weensy little bit illegal.Of the more than 100 Playpen-related child pornography cases that have been prosecuted, federal judges in Iowa, Massachusetts, and Oklahoma have ruled that such a search violated current laws of federal procedure and was in fact so egregious that the evidence collected as a result should be tossed. Other judges have rebuked prosecutors for unlawful searches, but they have not gone so far as to suppress evidence.As abhorrent as consumption of child porn is, entrapment is plain and simply against the law.  And planting malware on an unsuspecting perpetrator’s computer who was unknown to investigators before the investigation began is a form of entrapment, even if the consumer was into something illegal.  He or she didn’t know they were being scooped up in a net.  Furthermore, the scooping was not done in public as legal undercover videos are, but via planting malware on personal property where an individual should have a reasonable expectation of privacy.This is all allowed thanks to something called Rule 41, a provision for senior judges to issue out of jurisdiction warrants.Under one part of the current rules of federal jurisprudence, known as Rule 41, only more senior federal judges, known as district judges, have the authority to issue out-of-district warrants. However, a change in this rule set to take effect on December 1, 2016 will expand this power to magistrate judges, absent Congressional action.This example highlights a portion of the law that is inadequate for fighting cybercrime of all sorts. The unfortunate aspect of it is that the crime in question is consumption to the point of ownership of child pornography.  It is one of the few times one would think that the letter of the law could be relaxed given the gravity of the crime.  Unfortunately, no.  It puts too many civil rights for all Americans on tenuous footing.',fake
'FBI Director: The good law enforcement professionals within the FBI have had enough of their reputations being tarnished and their integrity blighted by their political hack Director. Jim Comey had a reputation for integrity and fidelity to the law when he was lesser known. The lack of character and his willingness to compromise for political expediency displayed in the Hillary Clinton fiasco have changed all of that.The FBI rank and file are in revolt and making moves to speak out before Congress and elsewhere regarding the conflicts of interest, blatant lies, violations of standard practices and the double standard that clearly now the rule of the day under FBI Director Jim Comey, Loretta Lynch and Hussein Obama.The FBI has gone from being an unbiased law enforcement operation to a subjective partisan arm of the Obama regime. Two agents, who are upset with the current state of affairs, provided a written statement, a copy of which was forwarded to the Daily Caller. One of those agents said of the decision not to prosecute Hillary Clinton, “This is a textbook case where a grand jury should have been convened, but was not. That is appalling. He added, “We talk about it in the office and don’t know how FBI Director Comey can keep going.”Among the most glaring breaches of protocol and best practices was the failure to search the Clinton house. The outraged agent wrote, “We didn’t search their house. We always search the house. The search should not just have been for private electronics, which contained classified material, but even for printouts of such material.”A second special agent who worked counter-terrorism and criminal cases said he is offended by FBI Director Comey’s remarks, specifically his taking cover among the reputations of the real investigators, the real FBI guys. Comey repeatedly used references such as, “the team, “we” and “I’ve been an investigator.” Comey is attempting to provide the appearance that he is experienced in investigative matters, but he’s just a lawyer.Jim Comey worked for both Lockheed Martin and HSBC as they became entangled in the Clinton Foundation web during his non-public payroll periods, earning $6 million with Lockheed. His brother, Peter Comey, works for DLA Piper, one of the firms receiving special consideration as a donor to the Clinton campaign in the Podesta emails. Clearly Comey understands how pay to play works and he’s part of the Obama Clinton team. His pathway is quite similar to that of Loretta Lynch though she lacks much of the “visible private sector” employment. She has made some very favorable rulings for Clinton Obama connected entities such as HSBC.The Daily Caller provided Comey’s career path in condensed form as “After graduating from law school, Comey became a law clerk to a U.S. District Judge in Manhattan and later became an associate in a law firm in the city. After becoming a U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York, Comey’s career moved through the U.S. Attorney’s Office until he became Deputy Attorney General during the George W. Bush administration.After Bush left office, Comey entered the private sector and became general counsel and Senior Vice President for Lockheed Martin, among other private sector posts. ‘President’ Barack Obama appointed him to FBI director in 2013 replacing out going-director Robert Mueller.”The second agent stated, “Comey was never an investigator or special agent. The special agents are trained investigators and they are insulted that Comey included them in ‘collective we’ statements in his testimony to imply that the SAs agreed that there was nothing there to prosecute.” The opposite was the case, as the agent said, “All the trained investigators agree that there is a lot to prosecuted but he stood in the way.” He added, “The idea that [the Clinton/e-mail case] didn’t go to a grand jury is ridiculous.”Joe DiGenova, a Washington D.C. attorney said agents are beginning to come forward, wanting to talk about what is happening at the bureau. The “special treatment” Mrs. Clinton and her cohorts received has many of them in near revolt and they are maneuvering for position to be called by Congress to testify under subpoena when they get back in session. There’s still an election in Congress’ futures so they have to at least put on the appearance of representation.In an interview last week on WMAL radio, DiGenova said, “People are starting to talk. They’re calling their former friends outside the bureau asking for help. We were asked today to provide legal representation to people inside the bureau and agreed to do so and to former agents who want to come forward and talk. Comey thought this was going to go away, it’s not.”“People inside the bureau are furious. They are embarrassed.” DiGenova said, “They feel like they are being led by a hack but more than that that they think he’s a crook. They think he’s fundamentally dishonest. They have no confidence in him. The bureau inside right now is a mess. The most important thing of all is that the agents have decided that they are going to talk.”Clearly Comey deliberately misinterpreted the statutes in order to provide the outcome his masters, be they within the administration alone or outside as well, were paying him to deliver. Now, as the rank and file become rankled, Comey may be joining Mrs. Clinton at the defendant’s table, at least until Obama delivers the pardon.Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'We’ve all heard the reports from former Secret Service agents that former First Lady [cough] Hillary Clinton was known inside the agency as an unpleasant person to be around.  In fact, being part of her detail was known to be a punishment of sorts.  With the release of 100 pages of FBI transcripts that description is confirmed. This is from a statement taken from an FBI agent with the State Department’s Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS) during Clinton’s time as secretary of state.[Redacted] explained that CLINTON’s treatment of DS agents on her protective detail was so contemptuous that many of them sought reassignment or employment elsewhere,” the interview summary says. “Prior to CLINTON’s tenure, being an agent on the Secretary of State’s protective detail was seen as an honor and privilege reserved for senior agents. However, by the end of CLINTON’s tenure, it was staffed largely with new agents because it was difficult to find senior agents willing to work for her.”SHOCKER!Not only was Hillary “unpleasant” to work with, but she really did have the opinion that rules were for everyone else.“From her own experience, and information obtained through [redacted] and other agents, [redacted] described a ‘stark difference’ between [Condoleezza] RICE and CLINTON with regard to obedience to security and diplomatic protocols,” the summary says. “RICE observed strict adherence to State Department security and diplomatic protocols while CLINTON frequently and ‘blatantly’ disregarded them.”Many of us have our disagreements with Condi Rice, but the woman is a lady.  She knows how to behave and respect other people and governments.  Of course, President George W. Bush was known for his punctuality and protocol adherence, so for his Secretary of State to follow the letter of the rules should be no surprise.The agent said that it is standard diplomatic and security protocol for the secretary of state to travel by armored limousine with the U.S. ambassador when visiting a foreign country.“CLINTON refused to do so, instead choosing to be accompanied in the limousine by her Chief of Staff, HUMA ABEDIN. This frequently resulted in complaints by ambassadors who were insulted and embarrassed by this breach of protocol,” the summary says. Clinton’s breaches of protocol, it adds, were “well-known throughout Diplomatic Security and were ‘abundant.’”And yet another Clinton era legend grows with comments from security details.  Hillary Clinton does as she darn well pleases, and doesn’t care who she insults.  Imagine that.',fake
'If the news coming out of Washington and New York is accurate, score one for Dr. Charles Krauthammer.  When the presence and use of a personal server by Hillary Clinton while she was Secretary of State was discovered and publicized last spring, he was the one to say that in the end it would all be about the Clinton Foundation and keeping its activity officially off the record books.Fox News is reporting that behind the headlines, the FBI has multiple parallel high priority investigations going on into the pay to play activity of the Clinton Foundation through the White Collar Crime Division in Washington.  In addition, sources tell them that information and evidence is pouring into the investigative agency, and not all of it is from the WikiLeaks caches that have been systematically released in recent weeks.Key Takeaways via RCP: 1. The Clinton Foundation investigation is far more expansive than anybody has reported so far and has been going on for more than a year.2. The laptops of Clinton aides Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson have not been destroyed, and agents are currently combing through them. The investigation has interviewed several people twice, and plans to interview some for a third time.3. Agents have found emails believed to have originated on Hillary Clinton’s secret server on Anthony Weiner’s laptop. They say the emails are not duplicates and could potentially be classified in nature.4. Sources within the FBI have told him that an indictment is “likely” in the case of pay-for-play at the Clinton Foundation, “barring some obstruction in some way” from the Justice Department.5. FBI sources say with 99\% accuracy that Hillary Clinton’s server has been hacked by at least five foreign intelligence agencies, and that information had been taken from it.Here is Bret Baier explaining it to Brit Hume:Essentially, then, the pay to play investigation is off the charts HUGE behind the scenes.  Somehow, the FBI managed to keep that quiet for over a year, and is now collecting even more evidence that may well claim more scalps in the legal sense than just Hillary Clinton.Stay tuned, this story is developing.',fake

'Massachusetts: If you too are habitually flaunting underwear outside your jeans in order to impress and attract women, then beware.A reputed institute making research on reproductive capabilities of species has claimed it can make you impotent. As the popular saying goes-I wandered here and there, to become Macho-Man, Alas! My bad luck, I became half-man!Like always, this is also a contribution of western influence, and is called ‘sagging’ in popular culture there.Men usually wear their underwear a bit higher than their pant to flaunt their expansive underwear brand, such as Jokey and Hanes. According to psychologists, men do this trick to attract women for mating. This behavior was developed in humans through millions of years of natural selection, and proves Charles Darwin’s theory of Evolution.Although this habit was developed naturally in order to help men reproduce more, because it creates apt environment for mating, but researchers say this has weakened our natural ability to attract women, that according to Natural Selection process, will fade away and go extinct.

'New Delhi- Taking a cue from its larger Eastern neighbour, sports officials in India are mulling making football the India National Sport. Currently, hockey is the national sport and cricket is most followed sport; but football does not feature in either. The officials want to change that, but why?China has made big news in recent years by buying prominent football clubs across UK and Europe. If you thought the Chinese wanted to profit from the game’s following in Europe, you are slightly mistaken.China aspires to use this connection to European football talent to improve the standard of play inside China. Not only will it help nurture local talent, but the number of tournaments and leagues formed in China as a result will create thousands of jobs of local Chinese. Plus, if the great footballers from Europe also play in China under player-exchange agreements, it will fill up the stadium seats.But the real reason is not just this. It is a much bigger objective. It is not just about football, but of wider political importance for China.It so happens that most of the powerful nations in the world are all football playing nations. If China wants to cement its position in this league of big nations, it feels it should also be a top name in football. If the big boys of the world play football, so will China. In this way, China’s name will always feature in the same league as the most powerful nations on earth.An example is the G-7 list of countries, which includes the big boys of North America, West Europe and Japan. Even China aspires to be counted when newspapers talk of the big nations. Thus, it’s a huge effort of its global branding.It is just like most business deals are struck on the golf-course, and many business executives learn golf just so they are also on the golf course in case business is also discussed. In the same way, it seems many big political decisions are struck amongst the powerful nations in football pavilions. If China aspires to cement its place further in the global political arena, being a top football playing nation may be one of the ways to get there.',fake
'Anybody who has been following the latest cache of wikileaks goodies – the John Podesta gmail account release – knows that the blame for their availability is being laid at the door of Russian Intelligence.  After all, the meme and narrative goes, everyone KNOWS that Julian Assange is a Russian Intelligence asset and they are hacking away at the Democratic National Committee and other prominent Democrats’ private email accounts and STEALING the information inside.  Not only that, but it is ILLEGAL for anyone other than the owner to be in possession of the material.Blah, blah, blahWell, there’s some problems with that:When it comes down to it, though, Craig Murray, a former U.K. Ambassador, put it best after a quick visit with Assange this week to dispel the rumors of the Aussie’s demise:Sometimes I quite enjoy my life. If you can’t annoy the arrogant bastards who run the world for the 1\%, what point is there in living? (Emphasis added.)UPDATEI left Julian after midnight. He is fit, well, sharp and in good spirits. WikiLeaks never reveals or comments upon its sources, but as I published before a fortnight ago, I can tell you with 100\% certainty that it is not any Russian state actor or proxy that gave the Democratic National Committee and Podesta material to WikiLeaks. The claim is nonsense. Journalists are also publishing that these were obtained by “hacking” with no evidence that this was the method used to obtain them.This writer is toying with a few ideas of what could be afoot, but without proof, the speculation would not do anyone any favors.  Just remember, the authenticity of the emails has never been denied, and John Podesta himself has not said the emails were stolen.  That came from CNN.What adds fuel to the conspiracy theory fires is the curious way the Department of Homeland Security – not a place like the FBI where the lifers are at odds with leadership – hinted at Russian involvement.. . . are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow — the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europa and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia’s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.“Consistent with” doesn’t mean did.  Those of us who watch cop shows know that serial killers have copycats.  Why should it be so different with hackers? From Murray’s blog:But the key point is that WikiLeaks is a publisher. It is a vehicle for publishing leaks, and is much more of a vehicle for whistleblowers than for hackers. It does not originate the material. I have often seen comments such as “Why has WikiLeaks not published material on Israel/Putin/Trump?” The answer is that they have not been given any. They publish good, verifiable material that they are given by whistleblowers. They are not protecting Israel, Putin, or Trump. Nobody has given them viable material.',fake
'Is this Fox News or MSNBC? The anchor is one of those newer faces on Fox, one who upholds the most rigorous CNN or NBC standards for Trump minimization or at least that is how things appear in this interview. Rule number one for Elizabeth Whatshername is clearly not to allow a positive statement regarding Mr. Trump or a negative one about Mrs. Clinton. If Pastor Robert Jeffress wants to slam Trump or endorse Clinton, then she’ll let him speak. Otherwise, she is to cut and interrupt his summary in the infamous rude style of MSNBC’s Chris Matthews following each question. This is the new Fox, more liberal propaganda, less news.She asks Pastor Jeffress how he defends the “most recent audio leak that we’ve seen,” recent as in eleven years old. “It’s guy talk, a private conversation and none of yours or anyone else’s business. Ask Clinton about her health, lies, Russian uranium and selling of government secrets” would be the quick, 27 word response. Pastor Jeffress takes a little longer and a slightly less direct path.He says, “These statements were lewd, offensive and indefensible but they’re not enough to make me vote for Hillary Clinton. He points out a statement he made the week prior with Trump seated next to him of, “Look, I might not choose this man to be a Sunday school teacher in my church, but that’s not what this election is about.”Too positive, time to cut him off as Elizabeth Whatshername springs into action. She says, “But it’s also about electing someone with character and with judgment [like Clinton?],” asking if he’s grown in the ten years between sixty and seventy and whether or not his judgment has really changed.”This bimbo needs to get out of the house and the studio more often. Maybe she should actually interact with a few real heterosexual guys, in groups where they’re talking freely, like around a football game at someone’s home. Give them enough time to get a beer buzz and wait for the TV cameras to find the cheerleaders. She might want to test their response to one of those college game cheerleader pyramids in particular, the ones where the girls on each side have one leg raised and the camera is inevitably held at a blatantly obvious angle just underneath. That’s an “accidental” shot that keeps happening, week after week, year after year, repeated over and over without anyone so much as noticing or commenting, right Elizabeth? Well, maybe occasionally a WNBA player might notice but no guys do unless their some kind of disgusting animals.And how about the Super Bowl halftime show with Beyonce doing her trademark “air copulation” followed by grabbing herself in a most suggestive manner that is then mimicked by her dancer entourage. It includes multiple displays of the electro-shock butt-shakes that look not unlike Hillary Clinton before she recommends “the cold choc.” And did anyone notice that she’s in her underwear? (Beyonce, not Hillary) Nobody but that womanizer Donald Trump, right naive Elizabeth?What Trump was exhibiting is something called normal male behavior. He’s not like her Fox coworker Shepard Smith or one of the many other New York metrosexuals who arise in the morning and self-identify their gender of the day as they’re deciding on what to wear. Patricia or Patrick, decisions, decisions.She asks how Jeffress would convince his congregation that he supports traditional family values. Maybe he could recommend that they look at Trump’s family, many married and with children. Why not look at this position on abortion versus the baby-killing Democrats?Pastor Jeffress tries to get the point across that we need a capable, honest leader, we don’t need a preacher-in-chief but it’s no use. Her job is to fulfill the new  Fox prime directive as they march headlong into the leftist propaganda media mainstream.Sabotage Donald Trump; it’s easy, pretend you’re someone you’re not, that he’s something he’s not, and that you’re outraged by a guy being a guy. What got him the nomination was being one of us and not the typical phony politician.

'Glenn Beck has clearly always had that side to him that doesn’t make sense, that side that makes you certain he must be secretly hitting the sauce again. Sure the round glasses and the “Hee Haw” beard and sweater were a part of his shtick to make him look “professorly,” as someone who could be trusted as knowing what he was talking about. Sometime it was enough, often the effort was wasted once he opened his mouth.Even a fully-crocked lush in the midst of a full-knee crawling, toilet hugging stupor arguably has a better grip on reality than Mr. Beck. The shouted retching coming from such an individual positioned alongside their favorite, ceramic bowl (one not containing smashed Cheetos) can at least be dismissed as the incoherent, reflexive responses to some negative internalized stimuli. Wait a minute, come to think of it, maybe there’s not that much difference between a guy puking his brains out and the “intellectual” ravings of the formerly respected commentator. Maybe it’s just Glenn being Glenn.It would take a book to document his bizarre behavior of the past. One noteworthy comment of late was his barely backhanded endorsement of Hillary Clinton. He’s gone from taste-testing Mark Zuckerberg’s sneakers, telling us that Facebook doesn’t censor conservatives and constitutionalists when we experience it on a daily basis, to supporting Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump. Beck is clearly out of his mind.Last Saturday Beck proved that point by posting an anti-Trump rant on his Facebook page and portraying Hillary Clinton, the lying pilfering spy and Butcher of Benghazi, as a more moral choice for president of the United States. After all, Glenn’s purity was tainted by the crass bus comments and Beck’s going to have to scrub his ears for hours just to get it back.Beck started off with what is actually a true, coherent remark, that “Every person, each of us must decide what is a bridge too far.” He then set about showing us that he’s crawling out from under the bridge and, don’t look, he’s gonna jump.He went on to cite his fellow Mormon and globalist tool, Senator Mike Lee, who, as my dad used to say, “couldn’t say sh*t if he had a mouthful of it,” describing him as having an internal struggle that has reached the point where he could not compromise. It’s baloney, of course. Lee has been in Romney and Ryan’s pocket throughout the election and is still trying to sink Trump on their behalf and that of their globalist establishment. Lee has no moral foundation for any outrage, he’s a purchased tool.Beck said of Lee, “It is not acceptable to ask a moral, dignified man to cast his vote to help elect an immoral man who is absent decency or dignity. Trump is not an immoral man, as both of those judgmental hypocrites know. The objective is to sink Trump to make room for the establishment status quo, which is what he and little Mittens Romney are doing.Beck attempted to portray their treachery as the high road, saying, “If the consequence of standing against Trump and for principles is indeed the election of Hillary Clinton, so be it. At least it is a moral, ethical choice.” Voting for the most corrupt candidate in history, whose reckless disregard and carelessness has gotten Americans killed, who has had a Muslim Brotherhood operative in her office and probably her bed for over twenty years in Huma Abedin and betrayed this country for cash in our most sensitive areas is, in the opinion of “Crap Head Beck,” a moral, ethical choice.He babbled on, “If she is elected, the world does not end…. Once elected, Hillary can be fought. Her tactics are blatant and juvenile, and battling her by means of political and procedural maneuvering or through the media , through public marches and online articles, all of that will be moral, worthy of man of principal [sic]. Her nominees can be blocked, her proposed laws voted down.”This turncoat globalist shill claims we can count on the traitors, Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, to effectively battle Hillary Clinton. We can trust them to stop her on Important issues such as Supreme Court nominees, when they gave away our Internet, approved Loretta Lynch, Jeh Johnson and John Kerry, wouldn’t fight amnesty, won’t impeach an illegal alien in the White House because he’s half black, uttered not a peep on the climate hoax deals and gave away their 2/3 ratification threshold on both the Iran deal and TPP. They wave a white flag before Obama gets to the “d” in surrender yet these charlatans are going to defend America from the Clinton crime syndicate?Sweet little innocent Glenn is willing to take that chance because that big bad man said some words he didn’t approve of. False moral high ground is more important than the future of our nation. As a slave to liberalism, he prefers to righteously lick his wounds as our children suffer, comfortable in the knowledge that he exacted his revenge on that “foul mouthed heathen” as they head off to work in the collective farms. That’s the premise although he expects to be saved from the farms, given one of those good jobs, like collecting the jewelry, gold teeth, or sorting the clothes of the patriots who are no more.Saying that if “one helps to elect an immoral man to the highest office, then one is merely validating his immorality, lewdness, and depravity,” Beck makes his pitch for removing Mr. Trump, which has been his position all along. We could replace him with…. maybe a Canadian. Maybe Ted Cruz is still available. Or the guy who lost last time, maybe he could win a three week campaign. That would be just the kind of respectability and sincerity that Senator Lee and Beck are looking for.Beck closed saying, “Trump stepping down does not guarantee a Clinton win, but it does guarantee that the Republican party still stands for something, still allows its members to maintain their own self respect and that it still has a future.”Actually it does guarantee a Clinton win as the lying political operative well knows and it’s probably the only way she can win. It’s also pretty obvious that the timing is orchestrated, as are his comments, in order to help the NWO globalists seal the deal and complete their destruction of America.Don’t worry about your self respect or future Mr. Beck. You lost both of those as well as your audience long ago, when you revealed your true self. By the way, Glenn, now that you’re all wrapped up in your morality and all, do you still hate the 9/11 families? Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'Just as the cops managed to control the situation in West Bengal, fresh riots broke out  after on-ground news reporters of Times Now and Republic TV clashed over viewership data that was circulated on social media.Reporters from both the channels were in WB to cover the communal riots, but soon they became a part of the riots themselves. It started with one reporter of Republic TV claiming that his channel had higher market share than all other channels.This did not go down well with one Times Now reporter who put forth his own stats to claim that his channel was the market leader. The argument soon snowballed into a riot, with reporters from both channels resorting to stone pelting and burning down OB vans.Cops quickly reached the scenes but the situation apparently is not under control. People from both communities, who were earlier rioting, came together to calm down the reporters but didn’t seem to have much effect. Local police too asked for additional reinforcement fearing escalation.“We tried speaking to sane voices from both channels and tried to calm down the rioters. We are also planning to take action against those who publish such inflammatory viewership numbers on social media,” said a senior WB police official.Mamata Bannerjee has reused to comment on the situation and called it politically motivated.Home Minister Rajnath Singh has come down heavily on the rioters in his characteristic way.

'Missisipi: Casting a shadow over humans’ ambitious programme to build ‘perfect humanoid robots’ who are to be better than their human counterparts in that they would possess unimaginable high-levels of IQ and EQ, a group of reserachers today claimed that the assumption was ‘incorect’ and ‘misplaced’.The researchers believe the humanoids would inevitably snatch the power from humans and rule the future world, as predicted by noted scientist Stephen Hawking, but they will be as desastrous and stupid to mankind as were their antecedents- Homo Sapiens.“The half-robots will have several religions and castes of their own. In facts, they would possess enough artificial intelligence and machine learning to create and follow several new religions, and to make a massive following at just a small gesture by their eye-like cameras,” predicted a researcher.“They would sit several hours a day in front of their personal virtual reality computers, abusing and harasing their fellow robots, to prove the point that earth is better shaped if it follows their individual narrow way of thinking,” he added.The humanoid robots of future will inherit all the bad traits from humans that is going to lead to its half-extinction, fear social scientists, and take that forward to the further journey of wiping off entire remaining life on earth. The earth will continue to stink till complete robots defeat these humanoids, and take over the world from them.',fake
'The Indian cricket board (BCCI) on Monday once again found itself surrounded by plenty of drama and controversy when its high profile Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC) withheld the appointment of India’s next senior men’s team coach, saying they needed “a few days more” to make the decision. Explaining the decision, Sourav Ganguly said that there will be a photography test which will decide who will become India’s next coach.The fresh delay in the appointment of a coach comes 47 days after the BCCI invited applications for the role. “What we have decided is that we will conduct a photography skills test as capturing the winning moments is also a necessary qualification of a coach and Kumble used to do it brilliantly. One has to take group photos, make albums and show those photos to players every know and then. This is the secret of good bonding among team members. Even the players have requested us that Kumble paaji used to take their brilliant solo photos, and even the new coach should have those skill sets,” Ganguly saidThis news may not be very exciting for both Sehwag and Shastri as both are not professional enough when it comes to photography. But there are rumors that both will seek guidance from Anil Kumble, the former coach and learn the tricks of good photography. Sehwag has infact purchased a new DSLR and is eager to click some photos soon. Dada also made it sure that there will be a thorough checking of the photos submitted by both,and any photo found to be plagiarized or photo shopped will not be considered for final selection. Leading DSLR sales representatives have a task on their hands to convince both candidates for using their brand of Cameras as big incentive packages are at stake.',fake
'In the past couple of weeks, a political term that has a specific meaning has been thrown around a lot in the alternative media by both the writers and those commenting.  “Gaslighting” has come up over and over, because that is what the mainstream media is doing with all the poll numbers that do not reflect the reality of the campaign trail.  How is it possible, asks the honest and trusting Trump supporter, that Hillary Clinton could be up in the polls when she can’t even fill a hotel ballroom?The answer is gaslighting.The term itself comes from a classic 1938 play that was turned into a phenomenal film in 1944 staring Ingrid Bergman as the woman who is gaslighted.  “Gaslight” refers to the lamps in the house of a husband and wife.  In the evening, the husband would go into the attic to look for a treasure that was supposed to be buried there.  When he turned up the lights in the attic, the lights in the main living space would dim.  When the wife asks her husband about this, he tells her its all in her imagination, thus making her think she is going mad over time.  This form of mental abuse – making people doubt what they are seeing is true, and what they know to be true – became known as “gaslighting.”Gaslighting, then, is more or less psy-ops, a battle for the mind, or to train the mind to see something that isn’t there and plant the seeds of doubt.  With all of the non-reporting and half reporting, the gaslighting by the mainstream media in the United States has gone what is known as “scorched earth,” a military term.  (Think what Sherman did to the south in his march to the sea. That was scorched earth.)The mainstream media is doing a full court press, if sports is your thing, or, in organist speak, pulling out all the stops.  They are debunking that which is legitimate, reporting in such a way to make the people who are still paying attention to them think that Donald Trump has no support among the people of the United States.Nothing can be further from the truth, and the sooner the people realize the mainstream media is taking their battle plans from a Civil War general and a classic psychological thriller, and quits paying attention, the better off we will be.Found on Hotgas.net by Bruno StrozekLadies & Gentlemen behold: a fully operational, fully nuke-lear, fully unapologetic or even capable of shame MSM/Uni-Party Élite Death Star.And it’s headed straight for you for the next three weeks.A Media Message Disbursement Terminator more ruthless, remorseless and completely unlike anything ever previous imagined, much less ever deployed.So great is The Fear amongst The Powers That Be that absolutely nothing can or will be left to chance.The Earth of Any Future MSM Credibility Shall Be Scorched, the Information & Reporting fields shall be salted.So poisoned will be the Media Landscape that No Truth will grow for generations.Believe nothing: no news, no polls, no editorials, no think pieces, no Learned Analysis.It is all calculated to dispirit, to confuse, to sow the seeds of doubt.Ignore them.  Mock them.

'Multiculturalism at its finest is pervasive in Germany.  For proof of this, one needs to look no farther than Green politician Volker Beck, called a homosexual meth head pedophiliac by Shoebat.com.  The man actually used the United States and some of our colonial like barrios and neighborhoods as an example of why Germans should just give up their nationalism and learn Arabic.The Green politician Volker Beck advises more relaxing when predominant language of immigrants in a district. Emergency Germans living there would have to learn this language, he says in an interview with n-tv presenter Constantin Schreiber.Constantin Schreiber: How can create one for immigrant integration approaches when is now widely spoken in some districts no German?Volker Beck: Other countries deal with it more relaxed that in some neighborhoods times another language is spoken by a migration Community. In the US, visit their Chinatown as you can find the areas where the Mexicans live, or depending on which community is just strong in the city. (…) There’s a bit of discomfort, because you feel you do not get what with. But if one is really important to learn this language. (…) At the point where there are problems with Islamism and violence, you must be pure with social workers, who then have the intercultural skills.…One can not generalize, but there is a hostility to Muslims in this society that grows from this generalization. Against that we have to reach out, as against Islamist tendencies in Islam. We must not look the other way at two things and we can not allow generalizations, because the always provide the democratic foundation of our society into question. (…) “The vast majority of even the Islamists in Germany is non-violent. In Islam there is problematic statements by some, but the Muslims in Germany have thus in the very large majority to do nothing. These are peace-loving people who believe in Allah, occasionally praying times, which sometimes go to the mosque and otherwise can be a good man’s neighbors. (source, source)Not to compare muslim invaders to Chinese immigrants whose descendants still live in dedicated areas, but, um, the Chinese, Mexicans, Germans, Poles, Albanians, etc., who came to this country legally and illegally did not demand the larger culture change to accommodate them.  They adjusted to the larger culture, albeit in their own neighborhoods, and maintaining a lot of their own traditions that do not disturb the law and order of the country.  (Actually, a lot of the traditions add to the fabric of the country and are fun to experience.) Yes, Chinatowns are a little different, as are the Italian neighborhoods, and the barrios, but they aren’t really uncomfortable places to be.Unlike muslim neighborhoods, there isn’t a better than average chance of being raped.In essence, telling Germans to quit complaining and learn Arabic is surrender to the invasion.  The problem is that the people didn’t want to be invaded.  Now the globalists are telling the people of the country to give up all that they are and have to keep the peace with invaders who want to kill them?Definitely NOT like Chinatown in the United States.',fake

However, the move backfired as everyone in the comments section started asking her who the girl in the picture was.People did not just ask who the girl in the picture was, they also reprimanded Shruti by asking her not to misuse someone else’s pictures on Facebook. A comment read, “Please remove it because the girl in the picture can sue you for uploading this picture without her consent”. Devastated, Shruti removed the picture and deactivated her Facebook profile for 20 minutes to escape the trauma, after which, she reactivated her profile and uploaded another edited selfie with the caption “B@cK w!tH A b@nG, H@terzZ keEp H@t!ng xoxo”.As quoted by her friends, Shruti was not only a make-up enthusiast but also a person who applied multiple filters to her pictures before uploading it. “She’d open the phone camera and start trying the filters before clicking the picture. Once the “filtered” picture is clicked, she would again go to photo-editing applications and edit it. Her phone was full of photo-editing software programs.

'Many Americans watched the globalist Newt Gingrich as he supported Donald Trump throughout the primary, almost in disbelief, expecting there had to be more to this than met the eye. We suspected an eventual attempt at co-opting the movement was in the cards, which would have been successful had Gingrich been able to maneuver himself into the Vice-Presidency.Trump was too smart for that, opting instead to go with Governor Mike Pence, someone like himself, who was more free of the DC contamination and who came without strings attached. We waited for the other shoe to drop, for the establishment insider Gingrich to reveal himself and what he was really up to. That other shoe fell on Thursday morning on Fox Business News. It came from the direction of Gingrich’s mouth.Gingrich took it personally when Trump called out the traitor Paul Ryan, his fellow world government devotee, for his disloyalty and attempted sabotage of his campaign. He didn’t cover for the duplicitous Mr. Ryan who is believed to have played a role in the release of the Billy Bush Bus Ambush video and who certainly was no friend to the candidate. Ryan, in league with Senators Mike Lee, John McCain, Jeff Flake and other of the political bordello class, attempted unsuccessfully to destroy Mr. Trump’s campaign and they are still doing so in spite of their being exposed.Gingrich seems to have taken the mission of diverting attention away from the traitors, of telling the American public, including those that might decide not to vote for Paul Ryan and his fellow snakes in the grass, that there’s no point to the public knowing what they’re made of. The fact that they are turncoats who attempted a coup with a month left before the election, on the eve of the second debate in a move that would have destroyed a lesser candidate is not something Gingrich believes should be addressed.Gingrich is showing his own stripes and where his loyalties really lie. He created a sound bite and media quote of “little Trump is frankly pathetic.” Gingrich is a seasoned political professional and who knew exactly what he was saying and the tool he was handing the anti-Trump establishment, both GOP and Democrats. There was no justification for wording his comments in that manner yet he chose to publicly align himself with Ryan and the globalists against Mr. Trump and the American people.He did so while pretending to be offering Trump advice. Those were not words intended to help, they were live rounds meant to injure. Of course Trump is not mad over not receiving a phone call from Ryan, he’s mad about being attacked and the phone comments were merely that, comments. Gingrich understands, but he’s able to attack Trump by playing dumb, so he does.He goes on to say, “Donald Trump has one opponent, her name is Hillary Clinton.” That is a falsehood. He has many opponents, they include the media, Ryan and the NWO boys, George Soros and his front groups, Islamic terrorism facilitators, foreigners in the country voting, Democrats corrupting the system, complicit judges ruling in favor of corruption and many more. To claim that there is a list of individuals or topics that he cannot mention regardless of the magnitude of their offenses is nonsense aimed at protecting his fellow globalists, who will strike again. Ryan is not through, none of them are, and Gingrich is not.There were other ways he could have made his point if that had been what he was after. It wasn’t. The establishment tentacles are securely attached to Gingrich. The man on the inside, the “Little Newt,” has been exposed for what he is.

'GOP Elites Declare War Noting that Donald Trump and we Americans are engaged in a multi-front war, he cited Trump’s comments not only in referencing the criminal Democrat as being unfit for office but “also declared Republican leaders as far more difficult than Clinton because of their weakness and their disloyalty to Republican voters and the Republican nominee.Dobbs noted that the number of Republican voters who said that GOP Congressional candidates should support Mr. Trump rose from 67\% before the debate to 74\% after. And these numbers are as he faces the tsunami of criticism unleashed by the mainstream Clinton propagandists.Mr. Dobbs says, “Yet Speaker Ryan and dozens of GOP lawmakers are at war now with Republican voters, and make no mistake, it is an open war between those GOP elites and the rank and file of their party because they are the ones who nominated Donald Trump.”“Ryan in particular,” says Dobbs, “seems to be in the death grip of morbid envy and petulance towards his party’s presidential nominee, and supporters and of course, voters. The latest Fox News poll shows seventy percent of Trump backers strongly support him compared to 57 percent for Clinton.”“Trump is the leader to turn this country around,” Dobbs says, “to restore prosperity, to build a better future for all Americans. He is about the future and Hillary Clinton is simply a continuation of the status quo.”He points out, “The GOP establishment is scared to death that Trump’s election would mean the end of their status quo and they’re right. And sadly, their interests don’t align with the nation’s or those of the American people. Trump is on the right side of history in this campaign and voters should ensure that the elites are history.Unfortunately we’ll have to wait two years to remove Ryan from his position as a Representative in the House but we do not have to wait to replace him as Speaker.

'You’d think by now that conveniently timed publicity GOTCHA! bombs would cease to give the mainstream media, the GOP, and the wussified men of America the vapors, but no.  The Hillary Clinton campaign released a locker room talk tape of Donald Trump speaking among men about women 11 YEARS AGO in what is considered “vulgar” language (that means common folk, but no one ever said elites were knowledgeable about linguistics) a little more than 48 hours before the second presidential debate.  In this audio, the nickname for a cat was used as an indicator of female genitalia.  (The beta males of the GOP seem to forget that there are much worse words to use when speaking of women’s parts.)  That alone, and talk of sex, supposedly disqualifies the man for the presidency.What would these people do if they ever went out for a night on the town with a Major League Baseball team?  Don’t answer that.  Come on, this was years ago, and the Donald probably didn’t even know it was being recorded.Within MINUTES of this release, every member of the DC Uniparty, including stalwart Trump backers, started calling for Trump to step down from the Republican Party nomination, as if being an alpha male, and shaking the tail feathers around other men was really objectionable in Washington.  (Do we really need to bring up the Capitol Hill sex grapevine?)  Even Speaker of the House Paul Ryan – a man who REALLY needs to go to Confession – betrayed Trump with that suggestion.Now, to the surprise of NO ONE who looked for the bombshell stories on Hillary and the Democrats that would be overshadowed by the tape release and the mass hysteria from the peanut gallery that refuses to take the blinders off and see that they are being played like a Stradivarius by the “gatekeepers” of information, word is sneaking out that the GOP knew what Hillary Clinton and her team were up to BECAUSE THEY WERE IN ON IT.(DC Whispers) Clinton operatives, alleged to be working in conjunction with the Washington Post, released a brief audio tape from eleven years ago that captures Donald Trump in some unsavory locker-room banter that included a reference to grabbing a certain part of the female anatomy. Multiple sources have now indicated this tape’s release was initiated weeks earlier, and that both House Speaker Paul Ryan and GOP Chair Reince Priebus, had been made aware of its intended use – and then failed to notify the Trump campaign, making them complicit in the Clinton Machine’s intent to harm the Trump campaign….Speaker Ryan was scheduled to do a political rally appearance with Trump today. Instead, he indicated he was disgusted and horrified by Trump’s naughty words from eleven years ago, and abruptly cancelled the appearance…. Apparently, that cancellation had been in the works all along so as to embarrass Trump.Uh-huh.  As if the alpha dogs out there actually have pristine mouths.  Having spent a fair amount of time around the people who think they rule the world…yeah, no.  And the beta males pulling this passive aggressive female-type shtuff (pardon my French), just confirms for all of us salt of the earth deplorables their duplicity.  We out here on the fruited plain care more about Hillary Clinton getting away with treason than we do Mr. Trump calling a woman’s parts a nickname for a cat.Sorry, y’all, but this one smells.  And it smells bad.  And not only that, the timing is so obvious that even the people in the checkout line at the grocery store said the tape’s effect was muffed.  (Oops.  Did I say that?)  And don’t think this is the end of the sabotage, either.  Many of us believe it’s just the beginning.',fake
'New Delhi: The Ministry of Home Affairs has made it obligatory for even people with disability, to stay still while the national anthem is played at the movies. This has left people furious and made them question the government’s sensitivity towards the issue.But the government has not stopped at this alone. The ministry has passed a new law, according to which people watching ‘Border’ movie on television or any other medium will have to stand full time during the screening of the movie.

'After a news website broke the story that the turnover of Temple Enterprises, a company owned by Amit Shah’s son, Jay Shah, rose from Rs 50,000 to Rs 80 crores in a year after Narendra Modi got elected as the prime minister, BJP President Amit Shah has defended his son by saying that the sudden rise is a technical problem. Earlier this year, the leader had defended his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots by calling it a technical problem.The rapid increase in the company’s turnover raised several eyebrows as the company which was making a meagre profit increased its turnover by an unbelievable 16,000 times in a period of one year. Amit Shah, hailing the business strategy of Temple Enterprises, said, “This is exactly the kind of development Narendra bhai keeps talking about. If you think it’s a one-off company that has made profits, you can also check the accounts of any company owned by Mukesh bhai and see for yourself that it is overall development of the country. It’s pure hard work and nothing else.”Interestingly, the company having Rs 80 crores as its turnover shut its operation just a month before demonetisation. Upon being questioned on the timely withdrawal from the market, Jay Shah said, “It’s all about prediction. If you are an entrepreneur, you have to do business keeping the uncertainty in mind. All thank to my dad’s sixth sense, we predicted demonetisation and stopped our business.” Jay Shah further threatened that he would file a criminal defamation suit against our organisation if we asked him any more questions. Our reporter, who was in dire need to visit the washroom, refrained from asking him the way to the washroom after the threat to avoid getting sued. When Amit Shah realised that the matter has reached Jay Shah’s washroom, he defended his son and said, “Getting the urge to pee is a technical problem of the journalist.” The All India Football Federation, after identifying Amit Shah’s ability of defending every accusation thrown at him since the 2014 Loksabha elections, announced that Amit Shah will be given the role of the defender in the Indian national football team.

'New Delhi. GST council has announced that a Facebook page will be opened for advertising and promoting GST in the country. People who support the page with a ‘like’ will get one month exemption from taxes, the council has further announced. The exemption starts from the day of the ‘like’ and continues for 30 days, it is learnt by Faking News.“The success or popularity of a person, a policy or a pressing issue is determined in the social media, nowadays. A hashtag, Facebook page and number of likes on it, Tweets and WhatsApp forwards and the comments collectively project the success. We agree that some WhatsApp comments are objectionable and the admins are arrestable. With GST, we are making an exemption. People are invited to speak their minds out,” a council member told Faking News.The announcement has created an uproar among the youth of the country, many of them simply live to like Facebook posts. Now, with this announcement, they can have a tax-free living for a month, by doing what they like to do all day and all nights.“I like this GST. I like to like it in Facebook. Guess what? I am going to invite my friends to like it too. Is there any exemption if your referrals like the page?” a girl who has barely crossed her teenage years asked Faking News.Answering the question about the implementation of tax-free month, the council member said, “We encourage Facebook users to attach Aadhaar card number with their user accounts. The bank account anyways has the attachment now. We will directly deposit the tax refund to the bank account. If one also likes the Digital India page and the UIDAI page, he or she will get further benefits,” the council member told Faking News.Upon learning the development, Facebook India is going to double up the servers to handle unusual surge in the number of likes and number of new user accounts, it is learnt by Faking News. Meanwhile, the Jio advertising and marketing team has written to the council giving a warning about giving anything free for people for a limited period. After one month, people will press on the like again in Facebook and ask the question ‘Why not continue ho gaya?’ Jio’s warning letter to the council read.',fake
'One of the toughest questions that no one has been able to answer till now is “acche din kab ayenge?”But recently, UNESCO declared “Am I looking fat?” as the most difficult question of this era. The world has witnessed numerous breakups and divorces because of this question being wrongly answered. A similar incident happened when a boy had to pretend memory loss upon being asked by her girlfriend if she’s looking fat.Surat: On the third day of Navratri, i.e. Saturday night, a Garba Night was arranged in a society where Falguni Pathak was going to perform. Super excited Rupesh and his girlfriend Poonam were all dressed up in traditional attire waiting for Falguni Pathak when Poonam, out of the blue, asked Rupesh if she is looking fat. Baffled, Rupesh didn’t expect this and said yes … no. Poonam started crying to which Rupesh replied, “aap kaun hain behen ji”.Rupesh’s question shocked Poonam. Apparently, Rupesh had lost his memory. Poonam tried to bring Rupesh back to normal but to no avail. Later, Rupesh was taken to the nearest hospital where he was admitted and supervised by senior doctors. The story took a U-turn when the doctors asked Rupesh to go through some costly tests and Rupesh, being a Gujarati, refused to do those tests and told the doctors that he was pretending to have memory loss.Things have still not sorted out between Rupesh and Poonam but they both are happy that it is not worse than it had looked like a few hours ago. The incident has made it clear that no-one has a perfect answer to “Am I looking fat?” and the best way to deal with this question is to ignore it.Rupesh has played smart to make his relationship survive. This incident is also a learning for girls who ask such questions even after knowing that no answer would make them fully satisfied.',fake
'The Sarahah portal has gripped the nation with its innovative concept of leaving feedback for people without revealing their identity. Posts from Sarahah have significantly dominated the timelines of Facebook users since the last week. Indian users have been found sharing links to their Sarahah profiles on their Facebook timeline and requesting their friends to leave an anonymous opinion about them that is interesting and worth sharing.Following the trend, Daood (26), a Facebook user from Delhi shared his Sarahah link to his Facebook timeline multiple times but received no feedback. Embarrassed by the poor response, Daood started leaving anonymous feedbacks for himself from fake profiles to share with his Facebook friends. The incident came to light after speculations grew as one of the Sarahah feedbacks he shared on his timeline read, “I had an amazing date with you, Daood, and I would love to date you again”. Daood’s Facebook friend, Amaan, who left us a tip-off regarding the incident, told us, “Daood is an engineering student. It is not just difficult but impossible for him to have a girl date him. That’s exactly where my suspicion grew that he submits responses for himself from fake profiles.”Another friend in his Facebook profile, who grew suspicious of his online activities, said, “Lately, he’d been sharing a lot of Sarahah feedbacks but none of them had a “Go to Pakistan!” message in it. Now, tell me, if you are a Muslim living in India after 2014, how is that possible,” he explained. When we confronted Daood, he rubbished all these speculations, “It’s true that I am an engineering student and cannot have a girlfriend. However, like every other engineering student, I also am preparing for civil services exams for a better future and will end up working in an MNC after pursuing MBA. It’s horrible how you media people fail to observe the scenario and jump to conclusions,” he said and went on to submit another feedback from a fake profile. ',fake
'Notwithstanding the I&B ministry’s decision to stay its decision to black out NDTV for a day for revealing sensitive information during counter-terror operations in Pathankot (and Kargil and 26/11), fans of NDTV continue to emerge in support of the channel.Following journalist Ravish Kumar creative show featuring mime artists, presumably representing a silent protest against the government’s decision, NDTV found two unlikely but perhaps not so unlikely allies in Syed Ali Shah Geelani and Hafiz Saeed. The separatist and the terrorist have announced their decision to participate in Ravish Kumar’s show as mime artists.“Nobody has done more for the Kashmir freedom struggle than Barkha Dutt ji,” raved Geelani to our correspondent. “I know that I am recognized as the leader of Kashmiri freedom, but truth be told, my commitment to the cause pales in comparison to Barkha ji’s. She used her brilliance and blamed terrorism in the valley on the rise of hindutva in India! She has highlighted a plan of blaming the burning of schools on Diwali crackers. She is a true Kashmiri patriot. Just as Jinnah is the Father of the Nation in Pakistan, we hope to make Barkha ji the Mother of the Nation when we’ll get our freedom. The least I can do is show solidarity with NDTV. I will dress as a mime artist on Ravish’s next show,” said Geelani before excusing himself to practice miming for the show.Hafiz Saeed was harder to track down. But our stringers in Pakistan reported that the 26/11 mastermind had been inconsolable ever since the government announced its decision to ban NDTV for a day and had spent an entire day binge watching ‘The Buck Stops Here’ with teary eyes. When the tears dried up, he sprang to his feet, yelled “Yeh sab RAW ne kiya hai!” and decided to join the battle for Freedom Of Expression by joining Ravish’s show as a mime artist.In other news, Arun Jaitley was spotted creating several Bot accounts on Twitter and retweeting Barkha Dutt’s tweets.(Reported by Citizen Satirist Natasha)',fake
'Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham discuss the situation with the media rigging the election and the fact that Republican traitors are refusing to support Mr. Trump. It’s a dangerous game they play, risking once again snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.Ingraham has a list of the WikiLeaks revelations that she recommends the Republican politicians, each of them, grab a copy of and fan out across the nation, speaking to their constituents in support of Donald Trump. She predicts that if they were doing that rather than stabbing him in the back as they are now, he’d be up ten points.Hannity agrees that it is stunning that Trump is only down by the small margin that he is, if those numbers are to be believed, given the amount of effort that has been expended on all fronts to sabotage his campaign and to put the reins of government into the hands of the criminal Democrats for four more years. If we can’t trust the media, why would we think polling companies would be any less corrupt?Hannity calls out Paul Ryan in particular among the more vile members of the traitor class, suggesting that regardless of the outcome of the election, a serious discussion needs to take place in the days following the election as to who is the next Speaker. Ryan shouldn’t even be in Congress, let alone in that position.Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'Cricketer Hardik Pandya, who is known for heroics on the pitch as for the experiments with his hair, will now be getting hairstyling allowance from BCCI to maintain his crop.The announcement was made ahead of India’s 4th ODI against Sri Lanka by a senior official. The exact amount was not revealed but sources say that it is quite significant.“He (Hardik) likes sporting new hairstyles and has a new one for every series. Since these players are nothing less than brands, grooming is an important part of maintaining that brand value. So BCCI has decided to proivide allowance to players to take care of their grooming needs,” said one official.“As long as it does not affect his game,we are fine with it. He can do whatever he likes with his looks,” the official added.Hardik was happy with BCCI’s gesture and also tweeted images of hairstyles he’d like to try out.Apparently, several cricketers had previously asked the cricketing body for allowances to take care of their grooming needs. “Virat too wanted tatoo allowance some time back. Other players wanted money for fairness creams, perfumes etc. Probably BCCI will agree to that too,” said a player who didn’t wish to be named.BCCI however made it clear that that facility will be made available only to cricketers are not to commentators and support staff.After the news made its way to social media, a few Pakistani cricketers too asked for similar allowance from PCB, but were immediately reprimanded by the board and were asked to focus on cricket instead. “Waise hi hamari board ke paas paise nahi hai. Mai khud saal me ek baar baal kaatne jata hoon taaki paise bach jaye. Aur inhe allowance chahiye,” screamed Najam Sethi, Chairman of PCB.',fake

'Hillary Health Video: Inappropriateness, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder and if you’re a supporter of global government and the establishment criminal syndicate that has hijacked and now poses as our government, there’s no place for truth. Google supports Clinton, Obama, Soros and the oligarchs so they do what they can on their behalf. There are reasons behind those weekly visits to the dingy-White House and censorship of what the peasant class is allowed to see and be exposed to must surely have been a topic of discussion at some point.As we know Hillary Clinton is the chosen heir to the throne of evil as the successor designate to the previous Soros puppet, Hussein Obama. Donald Trump made a video questioning Clinton’s suspect physical health and fitness for the office. There’s nothing unusual about that, it’s the type of thing candidates do these days; Clinton has a full library of her own attacking her opponent.The status of her failing health would be a legitimate question to ask of any candidate but particularly prudent given all of Clinton ‘s odd behavior and time spent away from the campaign, as well as her sudden, unexplained cancellations of fundraisers. That’s the equivalent of not picking up free money lying on the table, quite out of character for the greedy little bridge troll.Google’s protecting her from what they must have determined is a hurtful video, filled with hate speech that accurately depicts the fraud she’s attempting to perpetrate. The Clinton’s are indebted to Google for saving them from as much political pain as possible. While it would have been perhaps illegal or at best a blatant admission of their political agenda to completely remove the Trump video, they were able and more than willing to hide it, to make it more difficult to be seen.The Hillary Health Video was moved from the public, published listings to a non-published one. The video has a one word title of “Dangerous,” but a search for dangerous turns up only multiple word results, rap videos and the like. A search for Dangerous Trump predictably returns negative results about the people’s candidate.Going to the link directly, one sees a notice in a yellow ribbon, “This video is unlisted. Be considerate and think twice before sharing.” Of course Mr. Trump wants the video shared and Google knows that. It’s Clinton that wants to hide her health issues and for whom the video is being censored. Otherwise it’s a decent video but there’s nothing particularly noteworthy.Just the existence of questions being asked about her health was enough to prompt Google to censor and hide it. That reinforces what most of us already believe, Clinton’s suffering from serious health issues which the media, and that includes Google, are hiding from the public. She needs to be held accountable for the deception and the questions asked now. The American people want an unbiased medical team to evaluate her fitness, let’s see what they are so fearful of us finding out.Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'After Sunday’s debate, while on the flight headed towards what will probably be a hotel near her next event in Detroit, Hillary Clinton took a few minutes to chat it up with her public relations team, also sometimes referred to as the mainstream media.Answering a typical softball along the lines of “Mama Hillary, were you surprised by the way that mean old uppity Donald Trump talked to you tonight?” Clinton replied, “Nothing surprises me about him, really, Dan.” Of course Clinton never tells the truth but we can be fairly certain of one thing. That revelation he made that she’ll be facing a real investigation for her life of crime if he’s elected president was probably not something she expected when she first slithered into the debate arena.Trying to put the best face on what will be the first of many uncomfortable days for Mrs. Clinton over the next month, She said she “was surprised by the absolute avalanche of falsehoods.” The avalanche of falsehoods was hers, as is always the case. If she was surprised it was probably at how ineffective they were tonight. She might also have been caught off guard by the effectiveness of the return fire. Trump seemed to come armed with live ammo tonight instead of the customary rubber bullets and bean bag rounds.She might have underestimated the veracity of the response to her Billy Bush Ambush video attack. Clinton should have exercised more caution in the selection of a proper stick for poking the bear. This one was either too big or she hit the wrong spot. Now he’s angry and she’s got a real fight on her hands.As her eyes bug out in what has become the new “normal” for Clinton, she tells the reporters that she finds it “really unimaginable that someone can stand and just tell, you know, a falsehood after a falsehood.” Why is that so hard for her to believe? She does it multiple times a day. Has she never reviewed any of her videos? Is her mind so far gone that she doesn’t remember her last conversation or speech?It would be hard to imagine Trump doing it, but that isn’t what she said. She said someone and she is someone. Not a very trustworthy, honest, likable or leadership fit someone, but someone nonetheless. She’s someone who just got their butt handed to them on a debate and whose scrutiny over the next few weeks is going to become a lot more intense and a lot less comfortable.She enlists her assistants in the media to lend their “credibility” to her weak argument, asking them if they remember Politifact claiming that Donald Trump is untruthful seventy percent of the time and stating that he exceeded that level tonight. She wants people to fact-check because she doesn’t have a lie to counter Trump’s truths. They’re working on that now, so “check the website.” Hers are clearly made up figures whether the media sycophants and her paid yes men nodding behind her care to admit it or not.Her fawning media may need a third party service to tell them what is true and what isn’t because they’re too ignorant of the facts to do it on their own. Trump supporters are different. We’re informed and he was right about everything.

He actually said the word “treason” in relation to her actions.So, by taking mobile devices that could carry classified information out of the country and using them with other nations’ networks looking and listening in, McCaul’s opinion is that these actions are treason.  National security was put in jeopardy by Clinton’s hubris in thinking she could get away with this.  Consistently, the reports are that Clinton’s personal server – let alone intercepted radio transmissions – was hacked multiple times by foreign entities.There are those in the conservative blogosphere who claim that with is statement, McCaul “jumped the shark.”  After all, there was no direct communication between Hillary Clinton and enemy actors.  However, she did leave the door open allowing any or all foreign governments to invade her email, server, and other devices to just walk in and take information.',fake
'Mumbai: Famous director of Humshakals and Himmatwala, Sajid Khan is coming back to direct housefull 4. Movie lovers are super excited with Sajid returning as director, but they are upset with producer Sajid Nadiadwala who announced, housefull4 will be ready by 2019 Diwali only.“2019 Diwali means I have to wait for two more years and considering Humshakals came in 2014, we will get a chance to see our all-time favorite director’s movie after 5 long years. Bahut na insafi hai ye hamara saath,” said Kamal R Khan, who claims he is the president of Sajid Khan fan association.When some news channels sources started reporting Kamal and his friends are planning to teach producer Nadiadwala a lesson, Sajid Khan came forward to clear the air. “Housefull 4 will not be like my previous movies, this will have a solid script. Myself and my team have gone through two dozen DVDs, I am sorry, what I meant is two dozen scripts. All are so good, we are unable to finalize which one we would pick for houseful 4. That’s the reason we have not decided the cast for the movie. So, do not blame Nadiadwala bhai for the delay in movie release.”We talked to one of the close assistant of Sajid who is involved with the scripting process. While speaking to us anonymously, he said, “Sajid Bhai arranged DVDs from different corners of the world, which was more than two thousand to start with. After going through all of them we have finalized the 12, which Sajid Bhai is watching with us. Now we have to select one, add some of our own creative footage so that no one can blame us for copy right violation. Our part was ready long time back, we are just checking where it can go seamlessly.”   Sajid for a change does not want to repeat his earlier mistake of saying housefull 4 will be the biggest block buster of 2019. “Box office collection mere haath mein nahin ye. But script is in my hands. Undoubtedly it would be the best script of the year,” said Sajid in his trademark super confident manner. ',fake
'KANPUR: Not one but several girls were denied entry into the posh school ground where the annual P.T. display was underway recently. Some were genuinely denied permission for being ex-students but some interested girls were discarded entry without any genuine reason. The invitation card was given to the school students indicated in bold small letters of the parents’ entry during the programme.  However, the school staff’s stiff stand restricted a good many girls’ direct access to relish yearly show.A very peculiar case was seen at the school gate when one mother and one sister of the school’s authentic student did not get entry simply because the man in tie and pant was not ready to accept what was vehemently rejected by the girl. He was insisting upon her this prestigious school’s ex-student. The girl happened to be a bonafide senior student of St. Joseph’s School here. She even told this fact to the haughty man positioned at the entry gate. He never realised that the girl was speaking the truth. What he emphasised upon was that she should show her identity card if she was linking her identification with another school. Unfortunately, the girl student did not carry her ID at that point in time.She was even suggested by the heartless man to bring her school’s identity card from the residence at nearly six kilometres away.  What remained most irritating for the girl was making her ex-student of the school where the programme was in progress. The man would have simply forbidden her entry under the order. But he created wholly a different story for stopping her. That was indeed against the school’s traditions normally. He should have known that a crowd entered the school after 4 pm through the next large gate. That girl returned with a long face as she missed her younger sister’s pyramid display. She was wrongly assumed as ex-student despite her continuous denial.',fake
'Huckabee Sets Trump Straight: Governor Mike Huckabee believes that Donald Trump is on to something, though it might arguably not be where he should be devoting as much of his attention as he is. He notes, “The media is in an absolute frenzy to do everything they can to destroy the man. I mean, they sat on this stuff for years and they waited until just before the election to try to release it and then they play it nonstop.”Huckabee says, “And voices far more objective than mine, media critics and others, have recognized journalism in this country is dead as we used to know it. There is no such thing; it’s all advocacy. Now, what I wish Donald Trump would do, let surrogates fight the press. He needs to fight the battle for Americans on jobs and immigration.”Huckabee sets Trump straight he says if Trump calls him today that’s what he’ll tell him. “You go out there and fight the people’s battles, because they’re sick of open borders and they know with Hillary the Second Amendment, Fourth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment are all on the table. They know with Hillary that abortion is going to be more prolific than ever. They know that with Hillary taxes go up, they know that our national security interests go down, that Israel can’t depend, I mean we could go through a litany.”“Focus on those things,” Huckabee says, “and remind people that this election is not about something Donald Trump said 11 years ago, this is about the future of the country.MacCallum comes up with a supposed concern of the American people that Trump would go down rabbit holes in the White House. That’s a new one, she must have thought long and hard to come up with that one. Why not shut the constant criticism and try applauding Mr. Trump for standing up to this onslaught, Martha? Or are you in the tank for Clinton as well?If he doesn’t defend himself at least to a point, the media will adopt that as a validation that it’s working and add his silence to the narrative as “proof” that the false allegations are true. There is a fine line and he’s trying to walk it. The media is being shown for who they are, Clinton and the crooked Democrats are being similarly exposed.At some point the American people have to have enough sense to arrive at the obvious conclusion. Or maybe they are too far gone. Regardless, more Trump bashing by the formerly fair and balance Fox News isn’t helping the problem.Huckabee’s right, but a little positive press wouldn’t hurt now and then. He points out that as the nominee of the Republican Party, “they hate his guts.” It’s worse in the case of Trump, as he brings with him the destruction of the system of cronyism the media and their masters have constructed for the security and extension of their positions and power.“This is not a mild sort of gee, we don’t really like him, as we may have seen with other Republicans. They absolutely loathe Donald Trump.” The American people absolutely revere him and it’s still our country, for one more election.Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.comPlease like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'Mike Lee got his feelings hurt during the primary when his anointed one, Calgary Ted Cruz, was defeated by Donald Trump. He hasn’t gotten past Trump questioning why “his best friend’s father” was photographed handing out flyers with Lee Harvey Oswald. He also made a statement on video in July (below) that the reason he hasn’t endorsed Trump is because he’s made some religiously intolerant statements that Mormons, as a church that was targeted in the 1800s by the governor of Missouri, can’t deal with. Two hundred years is a long time for them to hold a grudge and Trump isn’t from Missouri, Senator.Mike Lee is a tool of the globalists, just as is his fellow Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and virtually all of their political office holders and influence peddlers. Lee pretends that his sheltered existence and strong faith guide him, and that he is this great constitutional scholar who is guided by our founding principles. That sounds awfully similar to the line of crap many Americans swallowed in 2008 and 2012.He’s actually the most vile of hypocrites, as he clearly demonstrated in the hissy fit he threw over the comments Trump made in the “Billy Bush Ambush” video. He and his fellow nevertrump globalists are attempting to seize upon it in a last-ditch effort to derail the choice of the American people. Who knows, perhaps they helped produce it.There is no fidelity to or respect for the Constitution in the hypocrite Mike Lee. There is only a bitter little puppet doing the bidding of Jon Huntsman and others who hold the key to power in his state of Utah, where Mormons vote as they’re told. That’s the same blind obedience that has saddled Nevada and the US with Harry Reid.Lee says he’s been thinking about how Mr. Trump’s statements make him feel, noting several times that he has a wife, a daughter, a mother and five sisters. The drama queen senator says, “It’s occurred to me on countless occasions today that if anyone spoke to my [insert repetitive list here] the way Mr. Trump has spoken to women, I wouldn’t hire that person. The “forgiving man” who champions his religion continued, “I wouldn’t hire that person, wouldn’t want to be associated with that person. And I certainly don’t think I’d feel comfortable hiring that person to be the leader of the free world.”It’s important to remember that this statement is not the result of the video changing Lee’s position on Mr. Trump. He has already refused to endorse him or state that he would vote for him. It’s simply the Mormon mafia Senator (like Harry Reid) using his position to opportunistically attack a candidate that is opposed to the globalism that Lee serves, the subjugation of America to world fascism.He says “We’ve been asked to settle,” which clearly means Lee still hasn’t admitted his and Glenn Beck’s boy lost. He’s been forced to accept defeat which to him means settling. We got who we wanted, at least to this point, in spite of Lee and his mafia’s best efforts to install their choice or hand the election to Clinton as an alternative. Americans only have to settle if traitorous, disloyal operatives such as him are successful in derailing Donald Trump and empowering Hillary Clinton.Lee doesn’t believe in the popular vote if it doesn’t incorporate a “Seven Mountains” kind of theocracy as would have been the case if his anointed one had been selected. Americans don’t want a combo preacher/pope/president. We want a president to take care of the nation’s business and we’ll choose our religious affiliation separately, without Senator Lee’s imposition or assistance.Lee claims a fidelity to certain principles, vague and never identified by anything other than “what will help us win in November,” as he calls Mr. Trump a distraction. Please enlighten us with a recap of the Republican achievements over the last couple of years as you pursued those supposed principles, Senator, while funding every Obama agenda item and refusing to challenge a single illegal act. Those are the principles you want us to support you on in opposition to the man who is our voice?He asks Trump to deny the will of the people, to set aside his record-levels of support because he doesn’t fit Mormon Mike’s model or the Seven Mountains template. “Sinless Senator” Lee presents himself as our moral compass, one that’s spinning wildly and aimlessly as are our founding fathers in their graves. Mike’s never uttered anything similar to what Trump did. That’s great for him. He’s probably not much fun at parties either, but to each their own; he can shut up now. He’s clearly lying and embarrassing himself.Lee’s admitted to having a daughter, so we might think that at some point conversations occurred during that process that might have had some similarities to the comments of Mr. Trump. Then again, maybe there’s a code of silence in the Lee bedroom. Don’t look, keep your eyes to the floor at all times. They just point and grunt in the dark, and hope for divine intervention. What a dishonest, transparent, politically motivated and mentally unstable specimen this Senator is but it’s not the first time he’s shown his unhinged side.It’s the same kind of emotion he showed in a video referenced earlier and posted below his statement, in which, near the end, he seems to be almost in tears over the stress of the insults to Senator Cruz. This guy’s not all there.The globalist hypocrite trash closes out his little lie-fest by saying, “It’s time for us to come together.” This is from the guy who still refuses to come together and join the man the American people have selected. Actually it’s not time, Senator Lee, it’s past time and you’re running very late.He adds, “There will be time to figure out the who.” Again Lee is behind the times as we are under thirty days until the election and the rest of us have long ago figured that part out.  Maybe his watch needs a new battery. He says it’s time to focus on “the what” as he urges searching for a different “globalist who.” Besides being late, Lee’s having a bad pronoun day.He’s still angling for Calgary Ted, his choice as the what (a Canadian citizen in the White House) or the who. He’s not going to settle no matter what. Too bad he isn’t as adamant about keeping Clinton out of the White House, but she’s part of the establishment world government crowd. She’s on his side.The unhinged part of the Lee interview with Steve Malzberg is really fiery beginning at the 7:00 mark below:Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'When a nation has a government of criminals it’s to be expected that they are going to use their positions to engage in criminal activity. At no time in America’s history has that stark reality been more true than under the outlaw Obama regime. Donald Trump met with ICE officers and union officials to discuss the abuse of power the Obama regime is engaging in, when the subject of the outright voter fraud being committed by the pretend ‘president’ and his DHS henchmen was raised.Trump, who was meeting with and receiving the first-ever endorsement of a presidential candidate by the ICE union, is picked up by one of the cameras in a conversation with one of the union representatives who is also a CBP agent.Trump asked why the illegal aliens with criminal records aren’t being kicked out and why are they kicked out and why the big rush to get them citizenship. The ICE official told him the reason is, “simply so they can vote.”After expressing his mild astonishment, Trump clarifies, “So they can come into the country so they can vote, how can something like this happen? It’s a disgrace.” He was told, “It’s happening.” As verification, the host offers a current situation in Indiana in which in over half of the counties the state police are investigating voter fraud. She also points out that no ID is necessary for mail-in voting.Varney would presume that this abuse of the system by the Democrats would put this issue on the forefront of discussion for Sunday. Matt Schlapp believes it will, asking “What is more sacred than assuring we have the right to vote.” The problem is that nothing is sacred to the Democrats and the establishment elites other than their power and wealth theft mechanisms.Varney is annoyed as are many other people by the Democrats immediately placing a label of bigot upon anyone who wants to protect the integrity of the electoral process by requiring an ID.  Schlapp notes that everything of importance that is done in our society is subject to proof of identification except for voting. It’s wrong to have even the risk of fraudulent voting, including multiple votes. In what is likely to be a close election, Schlapp says it is vital that the integrity of the count and the validity of the ballots cast be beyond reproach. We’re not even close; the Democrats have the steal on.Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'Patna: Manish Yadav, an economics student of Patna university, could not understand any of the questions. He just wrote the questions on his answer sheet and got pass marks of 35.However, Manish is disappointed with class teacher. Manish, whose life revolves around movies and movie reviews, feels if a ‘benevolent’ person like movie critic Taran Adarsh would have checked his answer paper, he would have scored at least 60 marks.“I am closely tracking Taran Adarsh’s movie reviews for last so many years. A person like me who can tolerate most of the movies, there are some where sitting inside theatres for more than 2 hours is a torture for me too. To give you some examples, movies like Sajid Khan’s Humshakals or recent ones like Patel Ki Shaadi for which some critics have given zero stars, Taran will gave two to three stars minimum,” said Manish showcasing his years of experience on movie watching and movie reviewing.“Taran has not given bad ratings to any movie till now. It’s like our MP from Patna Sahib Lok Sabha constituency, Shatrughan Sinha Ji who has not liked a single action of current NDA government led by PM Modi,” said Manish.We spoke to Taran Adarsh to find the reason behind his benevolent ways, “I am not mechanical in my movie reviews like the school teacher who gave 36 marks to a student for writing erotic stories on his answer sheet. Do you know how much effort goes behind movie making? Critics need to be little more considerate while reviewing and watch it from their ‘heart’ not mind.”Mr. Adarsh added, “I give box office collection figures for every movie through my twitter account. If something is not doing well, I give figures in lakhs or thousands instead of crores so that the distributors or producer feel ‘little’ better”.It’s not only Manish, students of CBSE and other boards in India are hoping they get more and more teachers like ‘Taran Adarsh’ to check their board exam papers this year.',fake

'An incredible smoke haze was spotted seen outside the NDTV office on Tuesday. Onlookers claimed that the reason was uninhibited bursting of firecrackers by people in the building.One onlooker claimed he also heard loud firecrackers-like noise near the NDTV office area followed by fumes curling up to form a V-sign.Experts say it will be difficult to ascertain the source of the emission. A leading pollution expert opined, “These days such peculiar fumes can be due to firecrackers during the Diwali season or because of pure human emotions giving rise to intense celebrations, revelry, etc.”This incident, according to the onlooker, happened on Tuesday evening, minutes after the news of journalist Arnab Goswami quitting Times Now surfaced.The UnReal Times could not verify whether the two events were correlated as the onlooker tried to imply.A few onlookers however insisted the fumes could be a smokescreen to hide some kind of celebrations inside the office. The UnReal Times could not even verify whether there was pun intended in this claim.Similar incidents of smoke over other media houses were reported too.Outside the CNN IBN office, one could see similar fumes rising, triggering alarm bells among onlookers. Again, firecrackers could have been behind the smoke, according to the observers.Outside the India Today office, not only was smoke seen rising in the air but a grey-haired man was seen enthusiastically distributing sweets among strangers.When asked, what was he celebrating the man replied, “Should we celebrate Diwali only during Diwali? Why not a day later? Does that mean we have become anti-national?”When asked if the celebration had anything to do with the Arnab Goswami resignation, the man replied with a grin, “Shubhratri. Good night!”Strangely, outside the Times Now office, no smoke was detected.(Originally published on Right to Laughter)',fake
'In a move favouring the players of the Indian cricket team, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced that the lower-order batsmen in the team can visit the tourist attractions in Sri Lanka during India’s batting in the ongoing Sri Lanka tour. The move was shortly announced after the first test at Galle, where several lower-order batsmen complained of not getting the opportunity to bat.The lower order of the Indian batting line-up was seen protesting outside the BCCI headquarters in Mumbai during the second innings of the Indian batting. “We will bowl our hearts out twice in the ongoing match and won’t get to bat properly even once. Is this gully cricket?” said a furious lower-order batsmen at the request of anonymity. He further suggested that BCCI should come up with an alternative for the lower-order batsmen to kill time during India’s batting. BCCI later announced that the lower-order batsmen can visit the tourist spots in Sri Lanka. “The cricketers have complained that they cannot go to vacations as we make them play the entire year. Hence, it is desirable that they visit the tourist spots on their official tour,” said a BCCI spokesperson. Following the decision, there are rumours of a fallout between the top order and the lower order of the Indian batting lineup. This was evident after pacer Umesh Yadav uploaded pictures of him vacationing on a Sri Lankan beach. “Dhawan bhai did not ‘like’ my pictures on Facebook. He’s upset that he cannot visit the beaches while I can,” said Yadav, hinting at the fallout. Skipper Virat Kohli was happy with the Board’s decision and termed it as a ‘progressive move’. “I don’t want to go to the beach. If I bat twice, I’ll score more runs and only break more records of Sachin paaji,” said a seemingly enthusiastic Kohli. ',fake
'Kashmir: The way smartphones are ruling the roost, they will soon all but have the kitchen sink fitted into them – technically they just might be able to, thanks to modular phones. With ever newer iPhones (with no useful features) and phones with more powerful computing capabilities than the world’s first supercomputer, it is sometimes terribly refreshing to take a step backwards.And who better than Nokia, the once ruler of the mobile phones market, to reboot one of its hardiest and most iconic phone models – the Nokia 3310. Yes, the phone everyone has seen in their childhood, that had nothing but endless hours of Snake (the game) to offer, is soon going to be back in business – with a few improvements, of course.But this has not gone down well with the Indian army which is fighting constant stone pelting in Kashmir. According to the Army, the 3310 will give another option to the separatists to throw at them. And according to latest reports, injuries caused by Nokia 3310 are far worse than that caused by stones. The government plans to levy a hefty excise duty on Nokia 3310 to inhibit its sales in Kashmir.',fake
'Ashutosh, a Bombay High Court judge, was arrested last evening after he entered a taxi despite the taxi driver’s ‘no’ for the ride. The incident took place outside Churchgate Railway Station when the kaali peeli driver Sukhram refused to ferry Ashutosh to the court. Considering it a feeble ‘no’, the judge forcefully entered the taxi, which lead to his arrest and, subsequently, his termination as a High Court judge.The incident has left him in a state of shock after he discovered that the feeble ‘no’ was a serious ‘no’, just like any other form of ‘no’, the fact that was unknown to the learned judge. “Feeble ‘noes’ mean ‘yes’; I’m shocked that I have been arrested for a stupid conflict of consent,” said the judge, “The matter would have been long resolved if I had molested a girl despite her feeble ‘no’, which actually suggests consent. It’s my ill luck that I’m battling it out with a taxi driver instead of a helpless girl who is molested.” Suspended judge Ashutosh appeared in the city court earlier today where he was granted bail. The taxi driver, on the other hand, has hinted vendetta after the judge was released soon after his arrest. “A ‘no’ is a ‘no’, be it a girl’s dissent or a taxi driver’s. A girl may, for once, say ‘yes’ if she is interested but we taxi drivers never say ‘yes’ for a ride. The judge should have known that before barging inside my taxi,” said Sukhram, who claimed to reject close to 100 rides every day. Talking to our reporter outside the court premises, he further pictured how law would have been on his side if he were a filmmaker or a film star with a driverless car, just before he went to reject his 58th ride of the day.

'On Tuesday night, Instagram users were dejected to see that Instagram was down for 7 hours. The exact reason for its crashing was not revealed by their technical team until today morning. And the reason is as shocking as it can get. Instagram had crashed due to an Instagram user from Mumbai, using 174 hashtags in his post. Yes, 174 hashtags in a single post!The name of the guy is Salim Hashmi or as he likes to call himself Salim #me. We interviewed the guy about his stint and he said, “See, that was not my fault. Many Instagram users use many hashtags. In fact, Instagram runs because of it. Just like Ranveer Singh’s body runs on hash, Instagram runs on hashtags.

No sorry.. 1785 posts.” We realized he had clicked a picture of our interviewer and posted it on Instagram with the caption ‘Getting interviewed guyzz. Having funnn’ and used 94 hashtags for it, all of this within a minute. We continued to interview him. He added, “Just because someone is overusing a feature that is freely available doesn’t mean that the app should crash. It’s Zuckerberg’s fault.” Meanwhile, he again posted a photo on Instagram without us realizing it.When asked what the fault of other users was to deserve this, he stated, “Do you think I don’t care about other users? My own brother is so much addicted to Instagram that he loves biryani pics on Instagram more than the actual biryani. When Instagram crashed, he..” he controls his tears “he didn’t eat anything that night because he couldn’t see the foodgasm and foodporn hashtag.

'There are some inconsistencies with the claims and actions of the anti-Americans at DHS and within the White House as they relate to the hack of DNC and other databases. The government syndicate claims that Russia is behind it, but a Romanian hacker who goes by the name of Guccifer 2.0 had the documents available for download long before he contacted WikiLeaks for help with distributing them. Romania is not part of Russia.Secondly, the amount of damage that was done as a result of those hacks is relatively minor. It’s not so much a national security issue, at least not that is evident to this point, and not nearly so damaging as the four years of perpetual nonstop security breaches which were standard operating procedure at the Clinton State Department and since in the John Kerry cover up.The hacks that they claim are of such great significance are merely those that are damaging to the political prospects of Democrats such as Hillary Clinton, the embodiment of national security recklessness. Johnson and his globalist Gestapo want to hijack the election for political reasons and they’re taking advantage of the hacks to feed their narrative that, for the sake of the security of the election, they must seize control. Of course they are the last persons on earth who should be anywhere close to our election apparatus.They are exaggerating the threat to either set the stage for a false flag event, to diminish the ability of the Trump campaign to claim the elections were rigged by claiming Democrats were attacked first by the Russians, or to create their own situation in which they are the ones who tamper with and rig the system but then blame their Russian scapegoats. All three possibilities are consistent with the narrative out of the Clinton campaign and the DNC that the Russians are conspiring with the Trump campaign to steal the election, something there is absolutely no evidence of.In an October 12th article in the Washington Examiner, the move to the big steal took another step. The message was that the threat to our election is significant, real and imminent. It stated, “Concerns about Russian hacking into the November 8 election have now reached the Pentagon where the military’s top cyber official has outlined a plan to help the FBI and Department of Homeland Security to track an election altering attack.” They would then go on to detail the “reasonable sounding” circumstances under which they are plotting to steal the election.That is the same Homeland “Security” that has completely dismantled our border, allows virtually anyone with a pulse to claim asylum and has terrorists they label as refugees pouring into our nation at this very moment. They and DHS Secretary Johnson have no security function other than to threaten and degrade it.Adm. Michael S. Rogers, commander of U.S. Cyber Command is helping Johnson pave the way for a takeover. He outlined the manner in which control would be seized over our election system by the crooks currently in power, to create the illusion of a legitimate response to the threat they are currently concocting and placing into our collective psyche, “it’s those evil Russians who want Trump.”Rogers said, “If a probe were required to determine if the election was hacked,” the default organized crime operation of DHS would “take the lead.” He elaborated, “Were there concerns that they thought there were an issue that would call into question the result, [states] potentially would approach the federal government.” Such an event would be a Donald Trump victory.He continued outlining their little scheme, saying, “The Department of Homeland ‘Security’ would likely have overall responsibility, they likely would turn to the FBI, us, and maybe one or two others, to say, ‘Can we put together a team and harness the breadth of this knowledge and insight and capability that you have to come back with an assessment: Do we think the result is valid? Do we think it was manipulated in any way? So that’s how I think it would play out.”Of course the facts would have no bearing on any of those questions or responses beyond how they can be manipulated to the political advantage of Hillary Clinton and how it can be done without being any more obvious than necessary.It’s laughable that DHS, and the FBI that are obstructing the Clinton prosecution and “maybe one or two others” is supposed to be a team that we trust to be unbiased and offer a fair investigation and a fair result. If these criminal organizations are involved in anything resembling electoral process insertion of themselves there is no doubt but what it is being done to steal the election.

'Immediately after India launched its PSLV C35 which placed multiple satellites in two different orbits, terrorist state Pakistan has announced that it too would launch satellites in a similar fashion.Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Commission (SUPARCO) chief Kaiser Anees has announced a three-fold increase of the budget for developing a launch vehicle that can equal India in its PSLV launching capabilities. Of course, given that no such budget has existed in the past, we are not sure how this will affect the program in any way.When our correspondent contacted SUPARCO, we were told that they were working on a new Launch Rocket which would achieve the same as India’s PSLV with a single burn. Revealing exclusive details, Dr. Anees said that SUPARCO will launch their BT-PSLV, short for Better Than Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle to launch satellites for the Pakistani government.To prove that Pakistan could do what India could, a competing satellite called SCATTERSAT-1 would be launched to take on India’s SCATSAT-1. According to Dr. Anees, it would provide better data on the oceans than any other satellite. “Indians think they can study the oceans from outer space? Well, when we launch BT-PSLV, the launch vehicle will get burnt completely and dump the satellite in the ocean. The satellite would then study the oceans from deep inside the waters!” scoffed Dr. Anees.According to Dr. Anees, this is only the beginning. “Next, we’ll send a rocket to Mars, and once that is successful, we’ll send another rocket to Mars with a terrorist, who, inshallah, would take out the Mangalyaan in line with the aspirations of the Martian people,” he said.As per reports received at the time of publishing this article, the Pakistan Air Force is giving the space program all the support it needs by closing the M-2 motorway for vehicles and enabling rockets to take off instead.',fake
'A techie from Bangalore has slipped into depression after he was unable to watch the launch of PSLV satellites as he was stuck in a traffic jam near Silk Board junction when the event took place.The techie, Surash Baliga, who also happens to be an astronomy enthusiast, was waiting for this day for a long time and was planning to watch the launch live on television, but things did not turn out the way they were supposed to. By the time he managed to cross 100 meters at Silk Board junction, the satellite was not only launched but it also reached the orbit and started forecasting weather.On Monday morning, Mr. Baliga left his house from Indiranagar at around 8:00 AM so that he could reach office on time to watch the event in the cafeteria and cheer for ISRO. He crossed Domlur flyover at 8:20 AM and was confident to be in front of the television before the countdown began. He flicked his hair with a toss of head and hummed, “Bharat humko jaan se pyara hai [India is dearer to me than life]” God, however, had some other plans for him.As he reached Madiwala, he noticed a sea of motionless cars in front of him. He tried to count, in vain, for the simple reason that human brain cannot process numbers beyond a certain point. “Damn, it’s easier to launch a satellite from India than drive on the roads,” he grunted.The light turned green and he pressed the accelerator hard, only for 3 meters as it turned red again. The process continued for another half an hour till he could actually see the signal. Meanwhile, he read on his Twitter timeline that the satellite was launched successfully. He was devastated, yet he did not give up hopes of watching the remaining part of the telecast.Signal turned green and he could see a 2-meter empty space in front of him. He looked at the auto driver on his right, and the auto driver looked at him. Three bikers gave him menacing glares from the left. It was a war now. You need to be at the top of your game to occupy that space. With a combination of salsa and jazz moves, the auto driver turned the handle 90 degrees and occupied that spot. The signal turned red again. Damn!A crow flew past his window. “Lucky you,” he muttered.The clock struck 12 and he reached the signal. There were only two cars in front of him. ‘This is it. My moment of glory.’ He waited for the light to turn green. His right foot trembling on the accelerator in anticipation…and it turned green. The two cars flew past the signal and it was his turn now. As his car reached the crossing, a cow came in from nowhere and stood in front of his car.“Hello, please move. Just give me two seconds and I will cross the signal. You can come back and block the road again once I am gone,” he implored.‘Am I being a bit selfish? To hell with it. That’s how everyone thinks at a traffic signal,’ he assured himself.The cow didn’t understand the magnitude of the situation and just stared back at him, and then slowly sat on the road. The signal turned red again. And suddenly, a plethora of tweets started popping up on his timeline. ISRO had announced that the launch had been successful and the satellite was in the orbit now.Crestfallen, he reclined in his seat and scrolled through the tweets. There was one tweet from Narendra Modi, congratulating the team of ISRO. ‘Nautanki,’ he grumbled, ‘Pakistan is planning to attack India and this guy is celebrating the launch of a satellite that will forecast weather.” He RTed.',fake
'Tim Cook unveiled the new iPhone8, iPhone8 plus and iPhone 10 at the Apple Event held at Steve Jobs Theater on Tuesday. While iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 plus have been priced at Rs. 64,000 and Rs. 73,000 respectively, iPhone 10 has been priced at Rs 89,000 (64 GB) and Rs 1,00,000 (256 GB).While the new phones may seem a technological marvel for Apple fans, it didn’t turn out well for all of them. The IT department conducted raids on all the people that pre-booked the new phones and in an interesting turn of events all of them were arrested for holding black money.We interviewed Mr. Suresh Jain, the head officer who conducted the raids and here’s what he had to say. “We had signed a deal with all major e-commerce portals way before the release of the new iPhones. We told them to provide us with the details of all the people who pre-book the new iPhones on the first day itself. Now, if you regularly pay your taxes, do you think you would be able to afford a phone costing one lac? Most of the people in India live on EMIs. You dissect an Indian and you would find more EMIs than blood cells. So if someone is willing to pay an exorbitant price of one lac for a phone so over-rated that it puts Bhuvan Bam to shame, it is bound to arise suspicion right?” He further continued and said, “So just like we planned we got the details, name – phone number – address, of all the people who pre-booked any one of the new iPhones and we conducted raids on all of them. And to our surprise our raid was 100\% successful. All these people had sources of black money stashed in their homes and offices. This was my debut raid as I joined this office just a month ago and I must say, my debut was even bigger than that of Hrithik Roshan.” At this point he noticed our editor getting down from his Audi, in his Armani suit with an iPhone 7 plus in his hand. So we had to end the interview to prevent another raid.',fake
'Gurgaon: Taking an extreme and rare measure to save crucial productivity lost in mobile browsing by its employees, Khapient Technologies has recently installed mobile data jammers at all the floors in order to stop its employees from wasting their time staring at their mobile phones for hours, instead at their desktops.“The traditional approach is not working,” said a senior HR Manager working in Khapient, adding that, “We do have, like all other IT companies, firewalls installed that denies any web request to leisure websites such as sports, shopping, gamble, social networking, porn websites etc, but that is not enough. With most of the employees having 3G on their smartphones, desktops have now become redundant, and these measures ineffective.”Mobile data jammers are generally used by politicians’ convoy when they halt the entire city traffic to ensure their smooth passage on roads. Jammers make sure people watch the convoy passing by with envy, rather than looking at their phones or talking to someone casually.Currently Employees even browse websites allowed by the firewall (such as news websites) on their personal phones, fearing that their traffic might be monitored by the company, affecting their performance appraisals negatively.As per the latest data coming from HR department of Khapient, productivity has increased thrice since these jammers were installed. As this news spreads like wildfire, other IT companies are also expected to follow the suit, raising demand for such hi-tech devices.',fake
'After the election of Donald Trump as President of Russia, season 1 of IT Big Boss has started in India.Responding to queries from the ChutiyaRepublic TV about intentions of starting such a unique game show, the CEO of Tech M said, “See an average Indian is quite smarter than their western counterparts, so this social experiment is to test their mental strength.We are analysing the outcomes by treating them like slaves with low salary & minimising their hikes.To maximise our show’s cost efficiency, they have to overwork freely.”The show’s concept is so impressive that even KRK requested to be a part of this new endeavour.Employees would be tasked with technical assignments which have nerve wrecking deadlines.In case of failure, they would be awarded a Maggi packet as a token of appreciation & fired instantly.Also, employees willing to donate their brains to foreign clients would be rewarded with extra points.An anonymous employee of Tech M said he is entirely joyful with the recent developments as it would make his life more adventurous like Salman Khan.As his variable pay has decreased, so he is quite optimistic about learning unique art forms of survival in frugal conditions.According to leaked reports, as prize money wildcard entry to the Automation’s Big Boss House would be arranged for all the finalists in season 1.Many IT companies have also played an early April Fool prank on recent hires by delaying their joining dates even after providing them with Job Offer letters.It seems that Big Boss wishes the young graduates to loose all their sense of self-esteem so that they would quickly abide by the rules of the game.Many economists like Superman & Rajnikanth have already given a standing ovation to the IT service companies for this brilliant strategy to improve their quarterly profits.But despite widespread allegations about layoffs because of the game shows, the HR executives are promoting it with a lot of enthusiasm.The spokesperson stated that it is the need of the hour to drive our employees to depression.After being in despair because of work environment, it seems entirely possible many of them might commit suicide.So in the long term, it would create more job openings.\r\r\n\r\nThe government has declined to intervene in this matter as a decrease in population would help in the overall growth of India.Meanwhile, Psychologists & Dhaba owners across the country are rejoicing with the new developments as it would lead to a spike in their businesses.Many parents quite concerned that their investment of 20 years aren’t paying off have approached the Prime Minister’s Office.The PMO office suspecting them to be JNU professors asked them to sing national anthem 108 times by standing on one foot as a pre-requisite condition to get job offers from Patanjali & Reliance Industries.',fake
'New Delhi- Information technology officials indicated that the coming days may see a transformative regulation in the way your email id was formed. While most people used their names in their email ids, or other words if they wanted to remain anonymous, the reality could be your Aadhar number will soon form your email id instead of your name or any other words.This means if your email id was [email protected] or [email protected] etc; the name or the words before the @ will be replaced with your Aadhar number. Assuming your Aadhar number is 11111111111, then your email id will now read as [email protected] and so forth.While the officials declined to reveal further details and preferred to maintain anonymity, they mentioned three important reasons why this change is being effected.One – it helps establish your true identity. With KYC norms becoming very stringent, and fighting cyber crimes a priority, it is critical to identify whose email id you are dealing with. Using the above example, thousands of other people may have names similar to you, or use adjectives like cooldude etc, that everybody claims to be anyways. But Aadhar number is a unique number, hence makes it easy to identify.Two – it helps control access of piracy and porn content on the internet. Given that Swachh Bharat is a focus area, the cyber space in India should also be free of garbage, said the officials.Three – it helps take digital marketing to the next level. Today is not the age of B2B or B2C, rather it is the age of B2I. This means Business to Individual. In such a situation, businesses across industries will get a clearer idea of the prospective customers they are addressing through digital marketing, since Aadhar number contains peoples’ profile. Customers can also gain by getting right products pitched to them, instead of spam of unwanted products. However, the officials declined to comment if indeed peoples’ profiles will be revealed to marketers.The officials said a cut-off date will be given- by when citizens will need to revise their existing email ids to reflect only their Aadhar number, or make new email ids with their Aadhar Number. This revised or new email id has to be updated in all the official places like banks and other service providers by that date. After that date, all other email ids inside India will become null-and-void, and customers will not be able to access those email ids any more.',fake
'A major scuffle broke out between the incarnation of Maharaja Jai Singh II, the original owner of Jantar Mantar and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday over the rights to use Jantar Mantar. However, the property dispute was later resolved when Mr. Kejriwal decided to leave the place and protest at Red Fort.Maharaja Jai Singh II, who built Jantar Mantar in 1724, had reincarnated in 1967, and has been keeping an eye on his property for the past few decades from a tea stall across the road.He was delighted to see tourists from all over the world coming in to admire the structure he constructed, and his self-esteem had hit an all time high when he learned from the tea stall owner that his Jantar Mantar is one of the most popular tourist attractions in India.However, for the past few years, he started to become a bit wary of a muffler-clad gentleman sneaking into the premise on a regular basis with a group of people. Initially he gave him the benefit of the doubt assuming they were just a group of theater artists hired by the administrators to entertain the tourists, but soon he realized that the man was popping up almost every day.“Damn, even I didn’t come here that often when I was the king,” grumbled Mr. Singh.And on Saturday when Mr. Kejriwal sauntered to Jantar Mantar again after breakfast, he said, “Enough is enough,” and decided to confront him.He patiently waited at the gate and when Mr. Kejriwal was leaving the ground after dharna, he stopped him and asked, “What are you doing here?”Mr. Kejriwal was dumbfounded by the question. He was not expecting anyone to question his rights to enter the place he belongs to, and he mumbled,”Umm, protesting.”“What?”“We…ahem,” he cleared his throat and said, “We are protesting.”“Fine, but why here?”“This is the place where we come to when we have to protest. This is where magic happens.”“Go and protest elsewhere.”“Where else can we go?”“Protest in your house, your office, or go to JNU, but stay away from my property.”“Your property? Does this place have an owner?”“Yes, I own this place.”“Hello, this is our official protest venue and we will protest here.”Mr. Singh lost his cool. He grabbed him by the collar and pushed him to the ground.“Oh, I get it, a Modi agent!” said Kejriwal, a hint of rabid glee on his face. “Go and tell your boss that Kejriwal is not scared of anyone,” he hollered.The news spread like wildfire and AAP supporters started tweeting about how Modi is not letting Kejriwal work. A few articles were hurriedly published about the emergency like situation created by Modi.Meanwhile, a couple of policemen heard the commotion at the ground and rushed to the scene, screaming, “Ink attack, ink attack.”“No, but it’s an attack on democracy. He is not letting me protest here,” Kejriwal pointed to Jai Singh.“But why cannot he protest? He lives here,” one of the policemen asked Maharaja Jai Singh and then turned to Kejriwal and inquired, “You own this place, right?”“Umm, no.”“Then?”“No, I mean, there are open spaces, ideal for protests and no one stops us so…”“Then you cannot use this place,” asserted the police inspector.“If Delhi police were under the control of AAP, I would’ve suspended you and this guy would’ve been behind the bars.”“You mean he would’ve been giving company to your MLAs?” they giggled.Kejriwal glared daggers at the policemen. “Fine, I am leaving. I will go to Red Fort.”“Why do you need to protest at historical places?”“Because I will create history!” he avowed and left for Red Fort.He was later seen at Red Fort practicing Independence Day Speech from the ramparts.',fake
'John Bolton: Evidence has surfaced of yet more impropriety at the most corrupt agency of the federal government outside of the White House and DOJ, the State Department. Patrick Kennedy, one of only six Undersecretaries of State, made multiple offers to the FBI in an attempt to have the classified markings stripped from some emails.The State Department spokesliar, John Kirby, assumed the familiar position of denying any wrongdoing involving State Department employees, admitting that Patrick Kennedy did discuss the classifications with the FBI, but it was merely for the purposes of clarification.\r\nFormer UN Ambassador John Bolton, who was once held the position of Undersecretary of State himself, labeled the events “extraordinarily serious.” He says, “The fact that the trade wasn’t made doesn’t detract from that, attempted bribery is just as much a crime as actual bribery.” Bolton compares what was happening in this instance with the selling of a Senate seat by former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, for which he went to prison.Bolton says, “What Patrick Kennedy was trading here was slots for the FBI in American embassies overseas. It may not sound like much but in the bureaucracy that was golden too.” Bolton, having held the position as well himself, believes that Kennedy “is really the circuit breaker between the State Department bureaucracy and Hillary Clinton.” Bolton believes he was communicating what was going on with Clinton and her staff, that they knew what was going on and if “if they didn’t they were asleep at the switch.”Bolton becomes animated at this latest instance of blatant corruption within the administration, saying, “This is attempted bribery. It is inconceivable to me that a State Department official could do this. You can’t change the classification of information, whether it’s a document or some other tangible form, for any reason other than a change in the circumstances that gave rise to the classification in the first place.”“This Patrick Kennedy was doing a political task,” says Bolton, “for Hillary Clinton, trading on government information and government resources, the slots in the overseas embassies. So this was bribery with your taxpayer assets at stake. It’s just, he should be removed from office. Certainly if I tried to do that I would have been removed.Hemmer asks if the unthinkable happens and the criminal wins in 21 days, “What is the hangover from these allegations?” Bolton replies, “I think it means that all of the questions about her conduct at the State Department continue. Remember, another aspect of Patrick Kennedy, he was deeply involved in Benghazi. He is the person who appointed the accountability review board that exonerated Hillary Clinton of any wrongdoing in connection with Benghazi and any incompetence without even every bothering to interview her.”Bolton adds, “And the emails in question that he was trying to trade on were Benghazi related emails. This cries out for the State Department not going into a defensive crouch but opening this up, because the conduct is unacceptable.”Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'Actor and patriot Jon Voight has an urgent plea for America, as he tries to talk some sense into the masses who don’t realize what is happening. They are stumbling along mindlessly, unaware of the serious threat we are all under. The threat of globalism and the death of our nation, brought about with the election of Hillary Clinton. He says:My dear fellow Americans. We are all feeling tremendous anxiety with only a few weeks left until the election. This will be the most important election in American history. We were once a country of freedom and now we are becoming a country of tyranny. We are witness to our own people burning down and looting our cities, Ferguson, Missouri, Milwaukee, Orlando Florida, Baltimore. We are all witness to our own people killing our policemen. Islamic terrorists have killed thousands of people all over our country and Hillary and Obama want to be politically correct and pretend all of the killings are not happening.How many Americans are aware of George Soros? An evil man who turned hundreds of Jewish people over to the Nazis to be exterminated during World War ll. He was interviewed on 60 Minutes and was asked does he feel guilty for what he has done. And arrogantly he said, ‘Absolutely not. If I didn’t do it someone else would have.’ Soros is a billionaire who made most of his money manipulating currencies and almost bankrupting many countries. He supports hate groups who are responsible for taking down our cities. And he is a close friend of Hillary Clinton and a major supporter of her campaign.Robert De Niro is a millionaire, as are so many of our Hollywood stars who are voting for Hillary and who have absolutely no tolerance for anyone of a different opinion, forgetting that that is what our country is founded on, freedom of choice. But they will not be affected by Hillary’s open borders. Only our poor and middle class will suffer. Thousands of refugees will flood our nation and no one will know the good guys from the bad guys.It will kill our economy, which is at an all-time low now under the years of Obama’s ‘presidency.’ And Hillary boasts of how proud she will be to continue Obama’s legacy. No one can afford health insurance now, prices for healthcare, gone through the roof thanks to Obamacare. Our once reasonable healthcare is gone.With Hillary as president we will lose our Second Amendment with our right to bear arms. Freedom of religion will be attacked. And Hillary will try to stop all conservative voices on TV and radio. Our highest courts will become socialist and she will restrict what America was founded on, our freedom to become a small business owner and pursue our own personal dreams.She has blood on her hands from the Benghazi terrorist raid. Four of our American patriots died and when their parents stood over their loved ones’ coffins, she lied to them about the cause of their sons’ deaths.The pendulum of freedom is not balanced. Hillary and her followers are on a crude campaign to stop and degrade all of Trump’s followers. Her words were echoed loud and clear for all Americans to hear. Hillary said Trump’s followers are a basket of deplorables, they are unredeemable. May God protect the real truth. And may Donald Trump win this presidency. He will save our America. And he will certainly make it great again.',fake
'Judge Jeanine Pirro tries to put the Trump “Billy Bush and the Bus Bimbo” video issue into perspective, having too much character and love of country to now throw Donald Trump under that infamous bus. She describes Mr. Trump’s language in the strong terms that her audience expects, whether that is her own feelings or not. Some people feel it’s completely over blown while some are horrified and are still dipping peroxide soaked Q-tips into their ear canals to regain their purity. She’s seems to be trying to find a midpoint from which she can help her audience get on to more important issues.She says, “The statements are devastating, the words are disgusting, it is awful, it is the kind of language that none of us want to hear. But let me put this in perspective for you. It was eleven years ago with a man who was in television. Sounds like a couple of locker room rants with a couple of guys egging each other on.”She points out, “But here is the bottom line, I don’t know if anybody is really so stunned by this that it deserves the wall to wall coverage that it’s getting, and I’m going to get to Hillary in a minute. But the most important part of all of this is it was eleven years ago. We’ve now got a man who apologized and to some people it wasn’t a sufficient enough apology. Ok, I’m sure that he’s going to probably do more in the next 24 hours.”She says, “But the bottom line is this. America’s in a mess, who do you want? Do you want a guy who’s got a past, who admits to you that he’s got a past, he didn’t plan to run for president? Or do you want a smooth-talking woman who hides everything that she says, denies the truth until it’s put in front of her and then she’ll still deny it, saying don’t believe your lying eyes?“We’ve got problems in this country,” says Judge Jeanine, “we’ve got problems with jobs, with ISIS, we want to take care of our families, we don’t want our kids to be in debt for the next two generations. And you know what, if you want things the way [they are] well then you go right ahead and ignore what WikiLeaks did and released about Hillary Clinton’s smooth talking. And you know who should be furious right now? The Bernie Sanders supporters should be furious. They are the ones who got taken by Hillary Clinton.”She says Donald Trump needs to get aggressive, that he needs to show several sides of himself in the debate. He needs to show that he’s embarrassed and sorry but then turn it around into the fact that he didn’t plan to run for president and he’s the one who can fix our lives, that he’s doing it for the country and really doesn’t “need this crap,” to be honest. He’s already got it all.Clinton on the other hand, needs this job, although she’s got her unsavory millions, the source of that money is her sale of government and that money flow could dry up rather quickly once she’s out of politics.Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'Former Supreme Court Judge, Markandey Katju, who follows the dictum, “Shoot from the hip first, and ask questions later”, recently outdid himself. He exhorted the Government to give Kashmir away to Pakistan, with the astonishing proviso, that Bihar should also be offered as a gift package deal! If Pakistan declined the Bihar offer, there would be no deal. The good judge is now being hauled off to court on sedition charges, and the resultant judicial battle promises to provide spicy copy for the media to wallow in.The UnReal Times (URT) caught up with the unflappable Justice Katju, and posed a few googlies, which he faced with characteristic aplomb:-URT – “Justice Katju, your recent remark on offering Bihar along with Kashmir to Pakistan, was so side splittingly funny and a telling commentary on the state of Bihar, but the Bihar state government don’t seem to see the funny side of it.”Markandey Katju (MK) – “I have always maintained that Indians lack a sense of humour. We have no idea how to laugh at ourselves. Perhaps the Sikhs are an exception, god bless them. I miss Khushwant Singh’s columns. Didn’t we learn anything from 300 years of British rule?”URT – “Point well made Sir, but coming back to your remark, satirical or not, offering Bihar to Pakistan was a bit off, wouldn’t you say? Not quite the straight bat”.MK – “Well, if we must speak in cricketing analogies, the straight bat is history now. What with T20 and IPL, cross bat is the name of the game. I did play across the line this time, and the Biharis were very cross. That is their problem. I could have gone for other strong contenders like UP or Bengal, but which other state could lay claim to have had an ex officio Chief Minister, running the state under house arrest, while his wife thumb prints all the official papers as CM from her rasoi ghar? That is a game changer”.URT – “Cogently argued Sir, as befits a former judge. You have also incurred the wrath of many in India, when you said that you found nothing wrong in eating beef. You were really pushing the envelope when you likened the cow to any other animal. Religious sentiments, and all that”.MK – “My friend, I am a self avowed atheist, so religion simply doesn’t come into the equation. Some religions don’t allow beef, others don’t allow pork, tomorrow somebody else will start worshipping goats, fish and fowl and ban their consumption. Where will we go then? Starve to death?”URT – “With respect Sir, we can be vegetarians”.MK – “What? You want me to eat ghaas phoos? And by the way, do you know how much vegetables cost these days? Every day we read about the price of onions and tomatoes zooming up, up and away. At least petrol prices go down now and then. By the way, are you a vegetarian?”URT – “I come from vegetarian Brahmin stock Sir, but I am somewhat lapsed. I eat eggs.”MK – “That’s another joke. Vegetarians think it’s all right to eat eggs, but not chicken. Look, how did we get to all this chicken and egg stuff. I thought we were discussing Bihar and Pakistan”.URT – “ We were Sir, but somehow we jumped to beef politics. I also have many questions to ask you about atheism, but I’ll have to keep it for another day. I have to file this report right away”.MK – “ Any time young man. Would you like to come out for a drink? I am buying. Hesitation? Don’t drink on duty? You can always have a nimboo pani, yaar. No? I don’t know what the world is coming to”.',fake
'Mumbai: I get, that concerts, especially the ones with international caliber, are expensive. And all of the times the management companies need to at least break even with costs when they’re getting international artists down to India.Last year, when Coldplay came to India, the internet went up in a loud roar when the ticket prices were announced to be 25,000 INR. That, some would still justify, and a lot of the audiences got the chance of experiencing the band for free; courtesy of the Global Citizen.Teekhi Mirchi did a survey that time and found that half the Indians thought Coldplay was a cough syrup, while other half thought it’s a newly launched Patanjali Cola cold drink.But 76,000 INR for Justin Bieber India concert, are you kidding me? That’s not even the monthly income of most of the households in India. RBI has taken a strong step in curbing this nuance. According to the latest guidelines, RBI has set the withdrawal limit from ATM to 100 INR per day, so that the youth cannot conjure up to 76000 to pay for the concert. Parents and teachers have welcomed this move and have promised to support RBI after a long time.',fake
'Donald Trump has proven over and over again that he is a MASTER at the news and media game.  On Sunday night in St. Louis, he proved it yet again. According to Neil Cavuto of Fox News, the pool of media people who follow Trump around were led to believe that they were headed to the Four Seasons for a photo op.  Instead, they got a live press conference with The Donald and three of Bill Clinton’s rape victims as well as the victiom of child rape who Hillary Clinton laughed off: Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey, Kathy Shelton and Paula Jones.  (Thanks to Gateway Pundit.)From a few blocks away, in the midst of the land of the moonbats, the Limits household stood and cheered.As it happens, the Four Seasons here in St. Louis is about eight miles from where the debate is happening, north of the Arch on the Mississippi River.  In good traffic, it’s about twenty-five minutes away.  From the photograph, if the room is not the Four Seasons, it looks a lot like the Knight Center, which is a conference center on the campus of Washington University where the debate is happening.  (Could also be the Ritz, which is down the street.)  Plain and simply, the press got punked, and the Clinton campaign – and the DC Uniparty – was outplayed.Consider the locker room talk audio tape neutralized, and the gloves off.  Trump is now playing hardball.  Not only that, dirty mouth talk is NOTHING to legitimate rape.  Nothing.  We the People know that.  So do the media.  And tonight, our alpha male candidate for president made sure everyone out there knows it, too.Bravo, Mr. Trump.  It’s not that often that we get to see someone with brass ones go up against the Clintons and not end up on an internet list.  We the People are enjoying this.',fake
'FINALLY! Somebody out there has had enough of Megyn Kelly and went off on her on national television.  No less than Former Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrigh, a far more experienced person in American politics, and towering intellect within the swamp of Washington, D.C., took her apart on her show Tuesday night.Note to Megyn Kelly and all the other women out there trying to make it in a man’s world, if you’re going to go there, expect to be treated just the way Newt treats Megyn here.  Like an equal.  No special treatment just because you have ovaries and a vagina.Watch this all the way to the end.  You won’t be sorry.Being one of the many people who would like to see Megyn Kelly crawl back to whatever trailer park she came from, this was delicious. It’s not hard to figure out that the poll numbers don’t match the empirical evidence of the size of Donald Trump rallies.  The WikiLeaks emails from John Podesta tell the story of poll weighting, not for getting them right, but for showing that one candidate is ahead when maybe he or she isn’t.As for Donald Trump and the pussy statement: WHO CARES! It is possible that the women accusing him of this, that or the other thing were rejected in some way by him. Yes, women will make up stuff like that. In addition, yet more Podesta emails demonstrate that at least some of the accusations were planned months in advance. This is all political posturing, just as Newt says.Newt’s right.  Megyn is fascinated with sex and doesn’t care about public policy, no matter her protestations about wanting to protect the women of America. (We could say that about just about the entire news media, but who wants to get in the middle of that orgy.)Bravo, Newt.

As a matter of fact, experts believe if Kashmir becomes an independent nation, she might earn a place in the history books of independent Kashmir, or the currency notes might have her photo printed on them, or at least a road could be named after her as an acknowledgement for her contribution to the separatists movement.Her tireless campaign to put forward the points of view of terrorists has been appreciation by many across the border and her minute-by-minute coverage of army movements along the LoC has helped many prepare for the situation in advance and respond accordingly. And although the services would still be available on NDTV, it seems a few in the Kashmir valley do not want to rely on a single source of information, especially when there are multiple options available now.Meanwhile, the competitors of The Washington Post have been caught off guard by the development and they are ruing the missed opportunity to reach a new audience. Some of them, however, are trying to regain the lost ground, and reports suggest that The New York Times is already in talks with Hafiz Saeed to write a weekly column for it.',fake
'Ever since the sequel to the 2012 spy thriller Ek Tha Tiger was announced, fans have not been able to keep calm. The trailer of Tiger Zinda Hai hit the internet on Tuesday, November 7, and the Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif film received a thumbs up from the audience. Such was the response to the trailer that it broke even Baahubali 2’s record. One thing missing from the trailer though was expressions on Katrina Kaif’s face. And even Katrina realized it and conveyed the reason for the same.According to Katrina, she has worked extra hard for her role in Tiger Zinda Hai, in fact she has spoken total of 2 dialogues in the movie which is way higher than her previous films. She even tried to act in this movie which is a big challenge in itself. Known for here pretty face, Katrina’s expression are the last thing people watch on screen, but after so many failed attempts at acting, no one is willing to spare her incapabilities. But Katrina has taken the criticism in her strides and come out with a logical reason for the flaw. According to her, most of the viewership for the trailer was generated from North India which is facing severe smog due to which her expressions were not clearly visible to the audience on their phones, laptops and other gadgets.Katrina has assured the fans that once they watch it again after the winter months, they will realize that she has actually improved as an actor and will give her due credit for her hard work. Yashraj has even promised to come up with a new trailer which will only highlight Katrina’s expressions because any ways Bhai doesn’t give many expressions himself. So lets wait for the new trailer before judging a hard working actress.',fake
'John Kerry is attempting to convince the American people that the Russians are behind the WikiLeaks document dumps and the hacks which are exposing the hypocrisy, deceit, bad intentions, crimes and treason of Hillary Clinton. While critical, he hasn’t said that the contents of the WikiLeaks documents aren’t genuine. He knows they’re legit or he would have long ago made that point through one of his spokespersons.For some reason they’ve decided that claiming the Russians are guilty of provocation and possible interference provides them with the best way of protecting their corrupt little operation. Kerry and the regime are rapidly ticking up the rhetoric with Russia over both the situation in Syria and the November elections. There is no shortage of bad men on the planet doing evil things. What is it about Assad and his country that make it such an obsession with the Obama globalists? What do they really want to arrange before the elections or before Obama is turned out?Kerry is now threatening Putin, both regarding Syria and Aleppo as well as warning that the US will retaliate if Russia meddles in our election. They are putting the idea into everybody’s head that Russia poses such a real threat that the regime is willing to go to war over it. Of course they’re even more likely to go to war over illegitimate non-threats that offer personal enrichment opportunities.Kerry engaged in some incoherent tough guy talk, saying, “We released this information to put the people doing it on a notice that they’re not, quote, ‘getting away with it’ for free, as well as to put states on notice that we’re serious when we say they need to take every measure possible to guarantee the integrity of our elections. And we will and can respond in ways that we choose to at the time of our choice.” He made his meandering comments Monday at The Internet Association’s Virtuous Cycle Conference.Obama made the same kind of statement the previous day, an indication that they are up to something. Coordinated messages are a preferred method of preparing the citizenry for an imminent Obama abuse. Kerry put on his “it’s different when we do it hat,” saying, “What makes the Russian thing so different is that I don’t think any of us engaged previously in democratic exercise where we actually tried to change the votes somehow by co-opting the counting process.” He may have found a niche that we have yet to exploit, it’s doubtful, but it’s a totally meaningless distinction. There is no disputing America’s long history of intervention in foreign elections and regime change.Kerry then addressed the topic but not specifics of actions by the Obama regime to intervene in the elections in other nations, such as Israel where Obama sent Alinsky style operatives in an operation called V15 to organize an opposition against Netanyahu. He admitted the US has tried to  “affect outcomes” of foreign elections, but argued for a distinction between American information-sharing and direct hacks. Nice sounding names make everything all better.The rest of his comments were more of the sort of aimless ramblings of somebody who has no chance of talking his way sensibly out of the jam he’s in, who babbles as a defense to confuse everybody into losing track of where they were and how he started his paragraph.Kerry proclaimed, “But that said, this ain’t the first time countries, ours included, have tried to affect outcomes of governments or – in one part of the world or another. I mean, go back to Iran in 1953 when Mosaddegh was run out by the CIA and Kermit Roosevelt and – we were engaged in changing government, or Diem in Vietnam when we – so there’s a history of involvement. And some people argue to me as secretary of state when I visit their countries that legitimate national institutions of ours like the National Democratic Institute or the International Republican Institute are engaged in that kind of activity.”He added, “People are in fact trying to close down the legitimate exchange of ideas, which is not what the Russians were engaged in, but we had engaged in the legitimate exchange of ideas and they label it ‘interference’ in their campaign, which is the difference.”“And that’s one of the reasons why we wanted to make clear people understood that distinction, because we don’t do those old things that used to happen. That is not a government role and it’s been, I think, for some period of time not something that we’re engaged in.”How long ago was Obama, Clinton and McCain’s little adventure in Ukraine, Kerry? Was that before or after Obama stopped doing “those old things?” Was Libya before or after? Egypt? And opposing Britain’s vote to leave the EU, Obama? Guess Kerry’s still has some more “making clear” to do.Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'LOC: 40 terrorists killed, 2 soldiers guarding them also reached their end. India claimed a successful surgical strike and Pakistan denied occurrence of any surgical strike. Teekhi Mirchi has exclusive details about why they denied occurence of this surgical strike.At around 4:30 AM that day, an army man went to the house of a guy to inform him about the surgical strike. (The guy, btw is a senior diplomat aligned with the most Sharif govt on the planet). After thinking deeply for a few minutes, he asked the army personnel how many questions did Indian army asked them.Left Shocked, army personnel replied, “Sir it was a surgical strike, not an interview!”“Then go to ‘Newshour’, and you will know what actually is a surgical strike,” replied the guy.“Yesterday Arnab told me that their nation wanted to know why Pakistan did not stop those Jihadis (terrorists) from entering India and perpetrating Uri attack. He ended up raising questions on my lineage. He did not even provide me a single minute in total show to speak, and he kept raising questions. He also asked me 80 times, to ask my mother about who’s my father. That is my friend, a surgical strike.”“What did you say?”, asked the army man.“Well, I called up my mother to check as soon as the show got over. Now I am 60\% confident. Next time if he asks me, I will be in a better position to handle him.”“Sir, what about the official response for this surgical strike?”“Well, as I said, my friend, if they kill you without asking a single question, that’s not surgical strike. If they keep you alive and keep asking questions, that’s surgical strike. Make it official and deny any surgical strike had ever happened. Tell them all the camps are safe.And they officially denied any thing of the sort to have happened. Twitter users however laughed at it as well.',fake
'Former captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s love affair with Chennai continues and it was once again evident when the India wicket-keeper came out to bat during the first ODI against Australia in Chennai on Sunday. But if I tell you that Dhoni’s contribution with the bat won us the match, it would be an insult to the man’s leadership abilities. In the second innings, it was his quick decision making which relieved Kohli off the burden to make decisions as Captain.After letting go captaincy of the ODI team, there were doubts about Dhoni’s place in the ODI set up. But some of his recent performances have put a lid on those openings. In fact, his captaincy skills are still used by India. And yesterday it was relevant enough to say so, after hearing dozens of small clippings through the stump microphone running parallel with match commentary. At each and every juncture where the bowlers were losing their line, Dhoni was quick to transfer tips, change fields, talk to the bowlers and almost every thing that a captain does.In fact the only contribution of Virat Kohli in yesterday’s match was the toss. After that it was pure Dhoni. We have to give credit to the commentator who anchored the presentation ceremony as he could have easily announced Dhoni’s name instead of Kohli’s for having a after-match chat, but he avoided that mistake. Looking at the vast experience MSD carries, Kohli has requested the BCCi to keep all the stump mic recordings in a safe place. These pieces of of information will help him in captaining the side once Dhoni retires. The recordings will also be used by IIMs across the nation to teach leadership skills to management students, HRD minister Prakash Javdekar was heard saying at a press conference.',fake
'Cover image is of Mother Angelica, the founder of EWTN, or the Catholic Channel.So far, all of the information coming out from the John Podesta emails provided by Wikileaks talked about politics and finding ways to influence public opinion.  Now, the cache of information is revealing another target: The Catholic Church.In an email exchange with a Jew, Sandy Newman, Podesta talks about planting the seeds of a “Catholic Spring” and fomenting revolution against the bishops in order to “Democratize” the Church:“There needs to be a Catholic Spring, in which Catholics themselves demand the end of a middle ages dictatorship and the beginning of a little democracy and respect for gender equality in the Catholic Church,” Sandy Newman, president and founder of the progressive nonprofit Voices for Progress, writes to Podesta in an email titled “opening for a Catholic Spring? just musing.”…“Even if the idea isn’t crazy, I don’t qualify to be involved and I have not thought at all about how one would ‘plant the seeds of the revolution,’ or who would plant them.”…“We created Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good to organize for a moment like this. But I think it lacks the leadership to do so now. Likewise Catholics United. Like most Spring movements, I think this one will have to be bottom up,” Podesta writes….The conversation further reveals the contempt with which radical progressives view Catholics and the Catholic Church.As if we Catholics didn’t know that.  The Church has been attacked by all sides since the first century when a Roman named Simon tried to infiltrate the teachings.  It didn’t work then and it’s not going to work now.  The Church has never been a democracy, but always a confederation of bishoprics.  In 2,000 years, we’ve even had popes worse than Francis, and we survived the worst apostate Cardinal of the twentieth century, even if Francis is trying to breathe life into that man’s dead heretical theology.  All revolution at this point will do is get a bunch of people excommunicated for heresy.  Public opinion rarely sways the hierarchy – especially on the topic that they were discussing.  The Lifezette article quoted above didn’t give the reason for the exchange.  Breitbart did:This whole controversy with the bishops opposing contraceptive coverage even though 98\% of Catholic women (and their conjugal partners) have used contraception has me thinking . . .Mr. Newman shouldn’t think too hard since that number is not accurate.  It was debunked some time ago, and includes the abstinence numbers.  Not only that, the Church teaching on contraception comes not from the bishops, but is eternal, and the reason why was best explained by Pope Paul VI in 1968 via the encyclical that reinforced the teaching, Humanae Vitae:Consequences of Artificial Methods17. Responsible men can become more deeply convinced of the truth of the doctrine laid down by the Church on this issue if they reflect on the consequences of methods and plans for artificial birth control. Let them first consider how easily this course of action could open wide the way for marital infidelity and a general lowering of moral standards. Not much experience is needed to be fully aware of human weakness and to understand that human beings—and especially the young, who are so exposed to temptation—need incentives to keep the moral law, and it is an evil thing to make it easy for them to break that law. Another effect that gives cause for alarm is that a man who grows accustomed to the use of contraceptive methods may forget the reverence due to a woman, and, disregarding her physical and emotional equilibrium, reduce her to being a mere instrument for the satisfaction of his own desires, no longer considering her as his partner whom he should surround with care and affection.Finally, careful consideration should be given to the danger of this power passing into the hands of those public authorities who care little for the precepts of the moral law. Who will blame a government which in its attempt to resolve the problems affecting an entire country resorts to the same measures as are regarded as lawful by married people in the solution of a particular family difficulty? Who will prevent public authorities from favoring those contraceptive methods which they consider more effective? Should they regard this as necessary, they may even impose their use on everyone. It could well happen, therefore, that when people, either individually or in family or social life, experience the inherent difficulties of the divine law and are determined to avoid them, they may give into the hands of public authorities the power to intervene in the most personal and intimate responsibility of husband and wife.No matter what one thinks of the Catholic Church or Catholicism, if the bishops were to bend on this – even with the threat on the mission of the Church being made via economic blackmail – then the Church has no moral authority whatsoever.  She is not a democracy.  She is also not a dictatorship, of the middle ages or any other time period.  She is the Church, the oldest institution on earth.  And we Catholics know darn well and good that the apostates have been steadily hammering away from inside the faith far more effectively than any “Catholic spring seeds” ever could.',fake

'Okay, so the email in question, written by Bill Ivey at Global Cultural Strategies to Clinton Campaign guy John Podesta, and found in one of the Wikileaks dumps over the weekend, didn’t say “keep the populace stupid” in those words.  But it did talk about keeping We the People in the dark, and manipulating public opinion by presenting information as the Clinton campaign and the surrounding apparatus would like the world to know it in order to keep us all under control. Read:And as I’ve mentioned, we’ve all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking – and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging.What Ivey, Bill Clinton’s Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, was expressing to Podesta was the challenge in fighting a celebrity-driven campaign, as Donald Trump’s is still seen to be.  That sort of campaign, Ivey lamented, was actually identified by John F. Kennedy, Jr., in his short-lived publication, “George.”  This is the sort of campaign that would ultimately by-pass all efforts of the leftist propaganda machine.  In the case of Trump, though, the Clintons came up against a formidable opponent who worked to reverse just about all of their work.Well, we all thought the big problem for our US democracy was Citizens United/Koch Brothers big money in politics. Silly us; turns out that money isn’t all that important if you can conflate entertainment with the electoral process. Trump masters TV, TV so-called news picks up and repeats and repeats to death this opinionated blowhard and his hairbrained ideas, free-floating discontent attaches to a seeming strongman and we’re off and running.Marvelous, isn’t it?Trump’s “hair brained ideas” happen to jive, align and otherwise dovetail with what the American people were all concluding at the same time he was starting to develop in-depth policy papers on the topics that concern us all.  Obamacare IS a disaster for the people and the country.  We DO want some sort of secure border between the southern states and Mexico.  Manufacturing jobs HAVE left the country in droves since NAFTA was signed.  Veterans ARE getting the shaft and shoddy care.  The list goes on and on.How does this get handled in the general? Secretary Clinton is not an entertainer, and not a celebrity in the Trump, Kardashian mold; what can she do to offset this? I’m certain the poll-directed insiders are sure things will default to policy as soon as the conventions are over, but I think not.To an extent, We the People all knew this was happening, and now we know there was a concerted effort to depress the air of patriotism among the people in order to keep us all under control.  To what end…theft of rights, prosperity, freedoms – any or all of the above.  This is known as manipulation of public opinion, and, yes, the fake media polls that all the pundits use to bolster their narrative are part of it.',fake
'New Delhi: Many TV audiences have written to News Broadcasters Association (NBA) complaining about news anchors missing from their TV screen, possibly from studios when the debate is on.Sandeep Singh, an avid news watcher who is attempting this year civil services examination for the sixth time is upset with this latest trend. While speaking to us, he said, “There are news anchors who are paid much more than the first citizen of India, i.e. President. When they themselves decide the topic beforehand, choose their panelists and put hashtags to advertise them, why they cannot be present full time to encourage the fighting spirit displayed by their panelists.”“Though I do not understand much from the ‘discussion’, I just watch it for my daily relaxation. I have noticed as long as anchor is there, he tries to bring the debate back on track as panelists always try to derail it and go as per their convenience. Once anchor is not there, the panelists speak whatever they want. Sometimes I am afraid some panelist might hit other one during live discussion. That would be a sad day,” said Sandeep.“That’s why I have requested NBA to come with a guideline on mandatory presence of anchors all through the debate. No running away in between to do some last-minute shopping because your spouse asked for it or pick your kid from some guitar or dancing classes,” said Sandeep.Sandeep added, “Agree no one can sit through full three hours, more so if you smoke or need a cup of coffee to recharge your throats. Utilize the breaks properly, if needed have extended breaks.”In the meantime, a news anchor after the break when he re-joined the debate, found two panelists have completely reversed their ‘roles’. “For convenience of our viewers, we display on screen who is going to say in support of the topic and who against it. These two panelists have reversed their positions. It was all chaos. My training before the program went for a toss, now I have to do it again tomorrow with a new group,” said the anchor.',fake

The goverment has now come into rescue mode and has finally found the reason behind this mass IT layoff.According to India’s IT lobby NASSCOM, Indian liberals and human rights activists are responsible for this mess, Indian government has nothing to do with it, economy is doing just fine, and there is nothing to worry about…at least for now.This latest declaration is in line with the stand taken by government supporter trolls on social media, and India’s mainstream media, who blame Indian liberals for every other problem related to government failure; from riots to Pakistan beheading our soldiers, to Maoist violence and so on.As the news of this latest condemnable act by liberals and human rights activists spread, Indian mainstream media took a dig at them.

'Barun Kashyap, the “Creative” Director who alleged that some gaurakshaks harassed him for carrying a leather bag is currently being charged for cooking up whole story as a excuse for being late to work. As expected this has not gone down well with Internet Hindus who are bashing him left and right for lying. Because of this man’s “creative story” and the subsequent reports by sections of the media resulted in the police wasting lot of resources to investigate it.Undeterred by the mounting criticism on the “Creative Director”, liberals have taken a leaf out of Modi’s book and declared the entire episode as a pre-emptive surgical strike to prevent possible future harassment by Gaurakshaks.A liberal, speaking to our correspondent Ashwin Kumar who had gone to pose for a selfie with him, had this to say: “Since Modi became PM, there are so many gaurakshaks waiting in their launchpads to pounce on all right thinking people with liberal values. So Barun has effectively launched a pre-emptive strike with this story to thwart any such possible attacks. I see him as an alert good samaritan who has strengthened the cause of fighting the evil designs of RSS and its affiliates.”“This episode not only demonstrates that Barun is an effective creative director but also shows his concern for a free and liberal society. It also throws light on police’s preparedness to handle such situations which are anyway rising at alarming rate since Modi became PM,” said another liberal.“Why is that when the Indian army conducts a surgical strike against terrorists, the country hails it, but when a free-thinking liberal does something similar against gaurakshaks, who, let’s face it, are even more dangerous than cross-border terrorists, everyone throws a fit?” asked another liberal, downing another glass of single malt scotch.Yet another liberal said, “People who identify themselves with liberal values will rally behind Barun for daring to stand against gaurakshaks and their evil master. This could very well turn into a huge movement, possibly civil disobedience, which will culminate in Modi’s resignation. After Hardik Patel and Kanhaiya Kumar, Barun is turning out to be a challenger Modi simply cannot ignore.”Meanwhile, NDTV’s Barkha Dutt is reportedly trying to learn Barun’s father’s occupation.(Reported by Citizen Satirist Raveesh Kote.

'In a written petition via Change.org, as many as 420 Indian liberals from a group named “Liberals for Indian Equality & Secularism” (LIES) have urged the National Aeronautical Space Agency to release a satellite map highlighting pollution all over India, during the Hindu festival of lights, Diwali. According to the petition, the map would go a long way in effectively eradicating the menace of pollution, which according to them, was largely due to the festival.A copy of the petition has been provided to us by The UnReal Times’ liberal beat reporter Christopher Ali Kumar, who himself is one of its signatories:“Respected Mr. Bolden,We are a group of concerned Indian citizens, who have united to seek your assistance in order to once and for all eradicate the catastrophic menace of pollution due to the Hindu festival called Diwali. Diwali, which is the festival of lights, has unfortunately been misappropriated by the communal, right-wing, divisive, Hindutva forces who viciously pollute the atmosphere, scare away and even injure poor, defenseless animals and birds with their egregious bursting of crackers and fireworks. Often, these majoritarian celebrations have gone overboard and out of control, disturbing the peaceful minorities, unsettling secularism and communal harmony, which are the foundations for the very idea of India. Accidental injuries to their own selves too have proved to be of no avail when it comes to curbing these detrimental ceremonies. Pardon the pun, Mr. Bolden, but the fact that they have a favorable Prime Minister in Narendra Modi only seems to have emboldened them all the more.All this is notwithstanding the fact that India’s national capital is already among the world’s most polluted cities. We recently determined that despite multiple statements of denials from your agency, a satellite map of India purported to be released by your esteemed organization, still continues to go viral every year, during this season and otherwise. Given the unmitigated response that the image has been getting for over a decade now, we beseech your organization to consider releasing a satellite map depicting India’s alarming, fatal pollution levels during the Diwali season. We are of the strong, firm belief that such an image would dramatically and remarkably pay off in wiping away the gross misfortune of Diwali pollution.If releasing such a map would be too much trouble, we are absolutely okay even with a hoax image which you could ‘leak.’ We could take it forward from there and ensure a significant impact.While it is real journalism to convey facts, it is courageous, important journalism to drive home a narrative for the betterment of people and like on countless other occasions, we firmly believe that, this time too, thanks to the prevalent, highly polluted atmosphere in India, the latter requires our unstinting support.Looking forward to your cooperation and support,Warm regards, LIES”According to Kumar, another petition is in the works urging the UNESCO to declare Diwali as the most polluting festival.',fake
'Sportswriters on the National Football League beat have been spinning and denying the elephant in the room on the great 2016 NFL ratings drop all season.  The demise of the value of advertising space on broadcasts is being blamed on competition from the election, boring play, blowouts, Payton Manning retiring, Tom Brady missing four games, bad officiating…you name it.Finally, at the quarterly owners meeting, the BIG MONEY people are acknowledging that maybe, just maybe, there’s a real image problem with Colin Kaepernick’s little temper tantrum, and the resulting cascade of players who don’t respect the rest of us.Then there are the protests. The national anthem protests by players, ignited by San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s mission to raise awareness about police brutality and social justice inequalities that victimize African Americans, has been a polarizing debate of its own on the NFL’s grand stage. Though the protests — from players like Kaepernick taking a knee, to players raising a fist, to players and coaches locking arms in unity — end when the games begin, they generate much discussion before and after the contests.Still, the impact of the protests illustrates the power of the NFL’s reach.“I think it’s the wrong venue,” Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay told USA TODAY Sports. “It hasn’t been a positive thing. What we all have to be aware of as players, owners, PR people, equipment managers, is when the lights go on we are entertainment. We are being paid to put on a show. There are other places to express yourself.”Irsay’s view is undoubtedly shared by other owners who frown on the protests drawing attention from their product. Given the intense backlash against Kaepernick, it’s plausible that people have turned away to protest the protests.“People come to the game because they want to get away from what’s happening in their everyday lives,” McNair said. “When you bring those types of things into the scene, yeah, it will turn some people off. But the main thing we try to do is to say, ‘We recognize your concern. Let’s do something about it.’ “The writer of the USA Today article, Jarrett Bell, is really in some sort of state of denial still.It’s striking that the anthem protests, connected to other factors, are viewed as a variable that seemingly runs deeper than other recent crises. The NFL took tremendous PR hits with its domestic violence issues and concerns about the effects of concussions. But those serious issues seemingly didn’t have a major effect on the ratings.Other bad publicity issues didn’t insult the fan base by stomping on patriotism.  That’s the problem that the NFL won’t acknowledge, that their gaslighted players are following memes and narratives that the American people, and the fan base, either do not buy, or see from the other side.  That’s why this year’s ratings look like this against last year’s. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnique Hits \r\n',fake
'A major first time occurrence took place at the Sunday presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton when the Republican nominee informed his Democrat lifelong criminal adversary that she’d be facing a DOJ investigation when he wins the presidency.Donald Trump took the microphone in hand, and told the audience and his opponent, “I didn’t think I’d say this but I’m going to say it and I hate to say it. But if I win, I am going to instruct my Attorney General to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation.”Mr. Trump continued, “Because there has never been so many lies, so much deception, there has never been anything like it. And we’re going to have a special prosecutor.” Clinton almost seems to find what Trump is saying to be humorous as she breaks into a big defensive smile. It’s more likely a nervous response of some sort, kind of like her odd cackles she developed before learning that Comey was in the bag for her. Now she’s probably a little unsure what to do with herself, faced with this new, unprecedented development.Trump lays into her, saying, “When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious. In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious. There has never been anything like this where emails, and you get a subpoena and after getting a subpoena you delete 33,000 emails. And then you acid wash them or bleach them as you would say. A very expensive process.”All the while he’s talking she maintains the same stupid grin on her face. He says, “So we’re going to get a special prosecutor and we’re going to look into it. People have been, their lives have been destroyed for doing 1/5th of what you’ve done and it’s a disgrace. And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.”She then stuck her foot in her mouth as she attempted to extricate herself from the hot seat, saying, “It’s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.” He quipped beautifully a response, “Because you’d be in jail.”Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'Lou Dobbs addresses the escalating problem of voter fraud, the engineered problem that Republicans failed to stop as the obvious manipulations of the system by Democrats were being carried out. He notes that in the State of Indiana, the State Police are investigating voter registration fraud in 56 of the state’s 92 counties. They’re focusing on a DC based liberal voter mobilization group called “Patriot Majority USA,” though the likelihood of there being anything patriotic about their operations is extremely remote.Dobbs notes how in the State of Virginia there were 1,000 illegal aliens registered to vote between 2008 and 2012. They’re also looking into at least 20 application in Virginia which were filed using the names of dead people.He also points out that forty illegals were discovered having voted in recent elections in Philadelphia and seven involving dead voters being registered in Colorado in the last 8 years. Lou Dobbs notes that Donald Trump has been warning ever since this race started that it was rigged and the proof is being realized now.Ed Rollins notes that the states that Dobbs identified are key swing states, with it being apparent that the Democrats have a master plan for fraud and the Republicans do not have one to match it for prevention. It’s an interesting statement to the lack of moral character of the Democrats that cheating on their part is a given that is not even surprising anymore and that Republicans are presumed to be honest and the ones who will be giving chase to the outlaws.Dobbs asks again what the Republicans are doing about the problem and meets Rollins’ silence with the question, “Can the Republican Party be any more screwed up?” That question was easier for Rollins to answer, “I don’t think so.”Dobbs notes how following up the 2008 and 2012 losses with the suicidal betrayals of Paul Ryan is madness. He goes on to display his total frustration and disgust with Congress and the totally corrupt system in place in DC, one that is well on its way to finishing off this nation.Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'An increasingly thoroughly disgusted Lou Dobbs says, “You could not make anything that is happening in this country these days, you could not make it up. A few thoughts now on Hillary Clinton and those who drive the Clinton Cartel from the Near East desk of the State Department to the office of John Kerry himself to the Clinton Foundation to the Justice Department to the FBI to the White House. The stench of broken trust and public corruption fills the dank, heavy air of our capital.”“Despite what you may be told by the Clintons and their accomplices and co-corrupters,” says Dobbs, “There are few accidents and seldom any coincidences in the dark, secretive Clinton realm of power. There is most often only careful calculation and orchestrated lies and deceit.”‘In a monumental Irony,” Dobbs says, “the search for truth hidden by and behind the rotting bureaucracy of our federal government has been chiefly aided by the relentless stream of emails, documents and secretive speeches given by Mrs. Clinton, all now revealed – by WikiLeaks. The WikiLeaks releases confirm without exception that the Clinton cartel will do anything to hide the truth from Americans, giving life to the axiom she stated in a 2013 speech saying, ‘you need both a public and a private position.”Dobbs observes that perhaps neither is the truth, noting that one aide under Clinton proposed a bribe to the FBI in order to make a problem go away by declassifying an email from the illegal Clinton server.  He notes that somehow the Clinton State Department still remains in the Obama administration, calling it a government within a government.”Dobbs is dumbfounded by not only the fact that the bribe was attempted but that there was a sufficient level of confidence in the pervasive corruption that the aide was comfortable in the attempt. He notes she simply refused a federal judge’s order to respond to 18 of 25 questions regarding her corruption. That’s an indictment on the judiciary as well and on the previously well-respected and highly regarded Judge, Emmett Sullivan. Dobbs points out that the only reason we know about the bribe attempted between two departments of the Obama administration is the FBI apparently learned from WikiLeaks and simply posted these illuminating and incriminating documents on the FBI webpage.”He’d like to think Director Comey developed some integrity and ordered the information posted.

'The Delhi Police have arrested an 18-year old boy, Samarth Sanghi, on charges of creating panic and endangering public safety. The arrest occurred after Sanghi inadvertently ended up dispersing a long ATM queue by flashing his Samsung Galaxy Note 7.Sam Sang, as he is colloquially known, was petrified during his police interrogation. “I have no idea what’s going on. I was waiting at this long ATM queue at Khan Market and out of sheer boredom, I decided to take a selfie with my Samsung Galaxy Note 7. I signaled to those gathered to pose for my selfie, but the moment they saw the device, they let out loud shrieks and ran helter skelter and a mini-stampede ensued. Some even screamed ‘Bhaago!’. (Escape!) I was stunned to see the queue vanish. I coolly walked into the unguarded ATM and drew my 2000 bucks for the day. The next thing I know, the Delhi police are at my doorstep and here I am, all locked up,” a teary-eyed Sanghi sobbed to The UnReal Times.Sang, however, was soon visited by Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, who carried his own Note 7 to the police station. “Mere paas sirf aloo ki factory nahin, Note 7 ki factory bhi hai! Mujhe bhi giraftaar kar lo bhaiya!” ( Not only do I have a potato factory, but also a Note 7 factory. Arrest me too! ) the Nehru-Gandhi scion thundered squealed, rolling his sleeves up. “If we empower the villages, we can wipe out Note 7s in 7 minutes,” Gandhi added.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal tore into PM Modi and Lt. Gov Najeeb Jung over Sang’s arrest. “As it is, the psychopath Modi has full control over the Delhi thullas. The whole world knows about the LG vs Samsung rivalry, so it’s no surprise that our LG has taken special interest in this case and asked the thullas to arrest Sang. Modiji, if you have the guts, arrest me! Yeh Kejriwal aapse darne wala nahi!” (this Kejriwal isn’t scared of you!) the AAP chief bellowed.Finance Minister Arun Jaitley voiced his concerns over the incident in an exclusive interview to NDTV’s Barkha Dutt. “Barkha, I appeal to the people of the country to avoid the inadvertent sabotaging of what could be a historic, pervasively successful scheme. Coming to the specifics of this case, I would urge all my fellow citizens of this great nation, in possession of Note 7s to switch them off before arriving at the ATM queues, taking into consideration, the larger public interest. Failure to do so will have me introduce a new Note7 Cess and impose it among the device owners,” the Finance Minister winked.The final word, however, went to the PM Modi himself. “NOTE stands for Nefarious, Outrageously Threatening Explosive,” the PM tweeted.',fake
'Vivek, a resident of Anurag Towers in Kanpur tried committing suicide on Monday by jumping from his apartment on the first floor.The 26 year-old decided to take the extreme step after his friends and family did not believe that he broke up with his girlfriend, Nidhi. Tired of failing to explain his plight to everyone, he finally decided to end life but only suffered minor injuries.Vivek, who is a social media enthusiast, used to keep all his Facebook friends updated by posting real-time updates about his relationship with Nidhi. “He always posted relationship quotes and pictures with Nidhi. From what they were doing, where they are, which movie they are watching to what they felt about each other’s families, he posted everything on Facebook,” Rahul’s close friend told us. “It was a very memorable day when Vivek changed his relationship status from ‘Single’ to ‘In a relationship with Nidhi’ on Facebook. Everyone in our group was so happy that we stalked Nidhi’s profile the entire day. We just can’t believe that he did not change his relationship status back to ‘Single’ after Nidhi left him last week,” said another close friend of Vivek.He also added that everyone in his friends list keenly followed their Facebook posts to get updates on their relationship. “If they broke up, Vivek should have updated heartbreak quotes on Facebook. We invested a lot of our time in following his relationship. We needed a closure too,” said his dejected friend who lived in the same apartment in Kanpur.Vivek’s parents fear that he might try jumping out of the balcony again. Every time he walks towards the balcony, his parents accompany him only to realise that he went to spit the pan out of his mouth. ',fake
'Bengaluru: Pradeep Kumar, an IT professional was shocked to see more than three thousand unread messages in WhatsApp after he returned from a week long vacation with his family. “Being a responsible WhatsApp user, I realized that unless I answer all these messages, I will not be able to focus on my work, that is why I requested for a week of additional leave”, said Pradeep while speaking to us. Pradeep said, “Knowing my habit of clinging on to my cellphone all the time, my wife had put a strict condition, she will come for vacation only if I keep my 3G or Wi-Fi connection OFF. Initially it was tough to adjust to this new life, but believe me, after few days I started enjoying. I even changed the settings of the mobile to airplane mode so that I don’t get disturbed by any calls either.”“After I came back and switched on the Wi-Fi, I was flooded with all these messages. Forget groups, basic etiquette demands I need to respond to individual messages that came from my close relatives and friends. However, as I wished them, they started asking me about my wife, how is she, how was your vacation, what all we did, was there a special package you got etc etc and that really reduced by efficiency while replying to these messages. That is when I realized that I will have to take some time off from work to respond to all these wishes”, said Pradeep with a frustrated tone.Pradeep is also planning to take a week off at the end of January to respond to all the patriotic messages expected to arrive on Republic Day.',fake
'Nikhil Gupta, a resident of Delhi, used up his internet pack on Sunday while searching for an honest review of the movies Ae Dil Hai Mushkil and Shivaay.Being a movie aficionado, Mr. Gupta was looking forward to the release of the movies and was following Social Media trends and news about them for the past few weeks, and in the process learned that it’s actually possible to judge the content of a movie without watching it.He soon realized the universe was divided into two distinct groups, one that loves ADHM and hates Shivaay and the other that loves Shivaay and hates ADHM. The following tweet from Mr. Nikhil Wagle compounded his confusion further:The aforementioned statement spoke volumes about his commitment to the, um, cause he was supporting but did not shed much light on Mr. Johar’s filmmaking abilities. He realized he needed to wait for the movie release and read the reviews to decide which one to watch first.On Sunday morning, he recharged his internet data pack for a GB and looked up movie reviews on Google. He first opened NDTV’s website where the reviewer Saibal Chatterjee gave Shivaay a 2 star rating, which was consistent with his usual ratings that range from 1.5 to 2.5. However, he was surprised to see a 4 star rating for ADHM.‘How did this miracle happen? Does he have all the keys on his numeric keypad now or has someone at NDTV told him the rating should be done on a 5 point scale?’ Mr. Gupta pondered.He placed ADHM higher on his priority list, although IMDb ratings of ADHM and Shivaay were 5.4 and 7.6 respectively. When he was about to close the browser, he noticed two contrasting reviews of ADHM on Indian Express. He quickly went through them and was relieved to see the reviews were done by two different individuals and it was not a case of split personality disorder.By the time he read the final review on the 10th page of Google, he started to lose faith in humanity, and hence decided to read audience reactions instead, only to find comments, such as ‘boycott ADHM’ and ‘I love Anushka Sharma.’ He read thousands of comments, which significantly improved his reading skills but did not help him arrive at a conclusion. While going through the comments, he received a notification from his internet service provider that he had zero balance left on his data pack.‘Damn, I could’ve watched both the movies online with 1 GB.’He had no choice but to watch the movies and find out himself. He went to the nearest theater and watched both the movies back to back. Later when he came back home, he wrote his own review titled – “Boycott Ae Dil Hai Mushkil and Shivaay.’',fake
'Bangalore. Intrigued by a WhatsApp message two years ago, a man in Bangalore set out to investigate and find the author of the message to congratulate him/her. He started asking in all the WhatsApp groups he was present, if anyone knew the author of the post. No one seemed to know. He continued his search for two years as was learnt by Faking News.After asking in the WhatsApp groups, he started asking in all the other social media including Facebook. What he unraveled was the truth about social media that what is viral in one App or website does not even have a reference in the other rival sites. There was absolutely nothing social about them or between them.Later, he sought after technical help and even contacted a few ethical and some unethical hacking companies for the investigation. Nothing helped. His search soon became very difficult as it was nearly impossible to find the owner of a message in WhatsApp, technically hacking or socially asking.The message once intrigued him by the sheer brilliance of its content, started haunting him, with a question, ‘Who said it!’ The words were written in a manner as though the author knew him for years. It was a tailor-made guiding light for his future, destined to reach him in WhatsApp.By this unaccomplished mission, his behavior over the two years had changed. He became more aloof, in severe contrast to the advice from the message. His wife at home initially took his strange behavior in the last 24 months as ‘office tension’. When he started talking to himself, she had had enough and finally asked him ‘what in the world is going on?’, avoiding the word hell; nevertheless stressing on a  tone that would mean nothing but hell.With much hesitation he shared details about his mission from 2 years. She grabbed his mobile and saw it. Seeing the message, the lady laughed out loud and admitted it was her who wrote and posted it in her school mom’s group. Both the man and the woman had requested Faking News to keep their identity secret and the message not be shared in the mainstream media.',fake
'Vivek (25), a Delhi-based engineer won free shopping vouchers worth Rs 25,000 from a city mall after being recognised as the loyal customer for visiting the mall every day for two years. Vivek, who is unemployed, used to visit the mall for free WiFi, which was the only low-cost item in the mall despite several attractive offers in various stores.An ecstatic Vivek said, “Soon after CM Arvind Kejriwal announced free WiFi in Delhi, I set off on the journey to connect to the WiFi provided by the government. After searching in every corner of the city and walking for almost three days to no avail, I visited the mall washroom to pee—and to my surprise, my phone got connected to an open WiFi network!” He further added that he then started visiting the mall every day and used the WiFi to download movies from Torrent.The mall manager, who, surprisingly, was impressed with Vivek, said, “He visited our mall even during demonetisation, unlike other visitors who gave up on us due to cash crunch. It was then when we decided that we will never find a more loyal customer, and awarded Vivek the free vouchers.”Being a frequent visitor of the mall, Vivek does not need to go through the security checks at the mall now. “We know that he will never blow up the mall because he’ll lose out on free WiFi if he does so. Hence, we have stopped checking him to see if he is carrying prohibited items,” said the security in-charge at the mall. Vivek, on the other hand, has demanded the full redemption of his vouchers. “I am an engineer and I will never be able to earn Rs 25,000 in my life. If my vouchers get redeemed for cash, I can at least tell my parents that my prolonged unemployment won me a reward.”',fake
'Star Plus refused to air comedian Shyam Rangeela’s act, which was recorded for the channel’s reality show because Shyam had imitated Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the act. Reportedly, the video of a mimicked version of PM Modi and Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi (making a guest appearance) has gone viral on the internet but the channel decided to not air it. Now even people are vary of the fact that mimicking the PM may land them into trouble. Many people have started reporting incidents where someone has mimicked the PM so as to help the police nab as many people as possible. Jagdish Malik tried doing the same but made a big mistake in his tryst of earning fame through media. Jagdish who was listening to Mann ki Baat today on radio thought someone is actually mimicking the PM and reported the incident in Bareilly police station.Jagdish, who has pursued MBA and is a well educated corporate employee has been a staunch follower of Mr. prime Minister. In fact he has been repeatedly conveying it to his friends and colleagues that ‘Acchhe din’ will soon arrive. So when there were rumors that mimicry artists who  were making fun of the PM will be put behind the bars, Jagdish took a challenge to help nab such artists. Today morning, Jagdish was seen doing what he does on every Sunday i.e listening to ‘Mann ki Baat’ on his mobile radio and soon he realized that the voice from other end could be of a mimicry artist. He recorded the voice with the help of another mobile handset and took it to the nearest police station. After thorough investigation, it was arrived upon that it was the PM’s voice and there wasn’t any adulteration.Many thought that after such an embarrassing incident Jagdish would mellow down and accept defeat in the challenge which he had taken. But to everyone’s surprise he has been watching every comedy show and listening to every radio program to catch hold of PM’s mockers.',fake
'Today is October 23, 2016 and most Americans will wake this morning and go about another routine day spending time with their family and friends. For the Marines, family members and loved ones of The Battalion Landing Team, 1st Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment their day will not be so care free. The Marines of the Battalion Landing Team will wake for the 33rd year with the memories of the worst day and experience of their lives. The date October 23rd and the time 0622 is a date and time they will never forget.For those of you too young to remember and those of you who have allowed time to let the memory of that date and time fade over the years, on October 23, 1983 at 0622 a 19-ton yellow Mercedes-Benz truck, loaded with 21,000 pounds of TNT, slammed into the four-story concrete building, that hundreds of Marines called home. In an instant the explosion took the lives of 241 of America’s finest.Moments before 0622, the Sergeant of the Guard recalls hearing the revving of an engine behind him, this was the yellow truck packed full of explosives that had crashed through a 5-foot-high barrier of concertina wire and was speeding toward their guard post on the perimeter of the Marine Barracks. The Sergeant of the Guard, Sgt. Stephen Russell, recalls the truck passing so close to him that he was able to look directly into the eyes of the crazed truck driver, who smiled at him as he sped past toward the Marine Barracks.Sgt. Russell began yelling “HIT THE DECK, HIT THE DECK!” Most Marine guard post providing security in a combat zone would be manned by heavily armed Marines. Back in 1983 that would have included perhaps an M60 or a .50 Cal., something that may have been able to render a vehicle inoperable. Not in Beirut though, America’s diplomats thought the Marines would better serve their objectives by being peacekeepers.As the yellow truck loaded with 21,000 pounds of TNT sped toward and past them they instinctively did what Marines are trained to do. As they quickly raised their weapons intent on engaging the truck in an attempt to stop or slow it down, they realized they had to load their weapons—something they were only allowed to do if being directly engaged. Only one Marine, LCpl Eddie DiFranco managed to load and chamber a round. By that time the truck was already crashing into the building.Sgt. Russell recalls seeing the truck crash into the building after speeding past them and coming to a complete stop in the center of the Marine Barracks lobby. “I saw the truck come to a stop, dead center of that lobby… Dead silence in the lobby, you could hear a pin drop,” says Sgt. Russell, who then thought to himself, “son of a bitch, he did it!” The next thing he describes seeing was a big orange flash!The big orange flash Sgt. Russell saw, was the largest non-nuclear explosion since WWII. The blast created by 21,000 pounds of TNT literally leveled the four-story building the Marines had called home. There were about 300 service members living in the building. The blast claimed the lives of 241. 220 were Marines, 18 Navy personnel, and 3 Army soldiers. This was the deadliest attack against US Marines since the battle over Iwo Jima in February 1945.Last year I had some Marines and family members contribute some personal stories that I published and I will share them again this year. Since last year something has happened that I was about to call interesting, but frankly it ticks me off.I doubt many Americans are aware of this, but in 2001 about 812 family members sued the government of Iran for directing the bombing of the Marine Barracks by Hezbollah extremist. The families were successful in obtaining a multibillion-dollar recovery in the case, Peterson v. Islamic Republic of Iran.On April 20, 2016 almost three years after a federal judge in Manhattan ordered Citibank to turn over $1.9 billion in frozen Iranian Central Bank assets, the U.S. Supreme Court finally cleared the way for the assets to be distributed to the plaintiffs.In spite of the highest court in the land approving the release of Iranian funds to pay the judgment to the Marines, to the best of my knowledge none of them have been paid. What irks me about this is that Obama just turned billions of dollars over to the Iranians that should have been used to pay judgment to these families. Obama used some excuse about it being their money and if we had not given it back, they “might” have sought a judgment against the US in international court.It’s just my humble opinion, but everyone of these families and Marines that were part of the lawsuit that obtained the judgment against Iran should have been paid BEFORE Iran ever received a dime!The Marines and families of the Beirut casualties did not have all of the resources and support available to them that our wounded warriors do involved in the War on Terror today. Hell, a lot of the country had no clue the Marines were even there. I try to write something on the Beirut bombing every year because in recent years they are not even mentioned by the main stream media. We should NEVER forget those who have sacrificed for our nation, most of all those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice!Thoughts?',fake

Cosmic radiation and solar flares pose existential threat to life in space, and we have not had a viable technology to produce enough Oxygen on Mars, and build an effective shield for radiation,” said Lansdorp.“…but not anymore,” he added in excitement.“We’re thankful to Indians for gifting this wonderful technology to mankind.

Not only have the old-guard GOP establishment candidates been vanquished by somebody who made billions despite all their regulations, one of the progressive darlings of the Senate is suddenly in the sights of a man who has far better name recognition.Former baseball pitching great, Curt Schilling of the Philadelphia Phillies and the Boston Red Sox, has decided he’d like to go to bat with the big boys on Capitol Hill.  The next Senate seat available in his state, Massachusetts, is Elizabeth Warren’s, she of claimed Native American heritage fame.  (This writer has ONE Native American up the family tree, too, but we’re still your basic Irish French Spanish Celts with a touch of Austro and Frank.)There’s only one problem with Schilling’s quest for Washington.Well, Curt, please, have that little conference because We the People would love to see a genuine American man go up against Fauxcahontas and come out on top…wait, that came out wrong.Schilling has flirted with a political run for years, having been floated as a potential candidate since his retirement after the conclusion of his big-league career in 2008. The pitcher has also expressed interest in running for president.One thing at a time, there, big guy.  (And don’t forget Major League Baseball could use a decent commissioner.)Schilling supports Donald Trump for president, and has been in hot water with media types who think its their job to expose all things private for having a conversation with The Donald about a woman ten years younger.  He also is known to defend women who are put in vulnerable positions, even being fired by his previous employer, ESPN, for his stance against transexuals in the women’s rest room.Schilling was fired by his previous employer, ESPN, where he served as an analyst, for sharing a Facebook post featuring a man dressed as a woman and commenting that “a man is a man no matter what they call themselves.”He shared the post to express his support for laws prohibiting transgender individuals from using the bathroom of their choice.“I don’t care what they are, who they sleep with, men’s room was designed for the penis, women’s not so much,” the post continued. “Now you need laws telling us differently? Pathetic.”For that stance alone, Schilling is bound to get quite a bit of cheerleading from the fruited plain.2016 is just the beginning.  The people have had enough.',fake

The 1 million user base matrimonial website is now coming up with an ‘Add To Cart’ option. You can choose your life partner and add them to cart and get them delivered to your house after checking out.The CEO of barbaadi.com, Mr. Mangal Kumar, was available for an interview on Skype. Here’s what he had to say about this breakthrough feature, “It is a known fact that e-commerce sites have add to cart option. All of us shop on them and get various items delivered to our house. So this one day, I was ordering the book ‘How To Get A Girlfriend’ from Amazon as it had a 95\% discount. I know you wouldn’t believe it.. but yes.. I AM single. Owner of a matrimonial site being single is like a bakery owner having sugar deficiency. Anyway, when I saw ‘Add To Cart’ option on the site, a bulb glowed inside my head. I thought why not add this feature and similar other features of e-commerce sites that people love to use, to my matrimonial site. I gathered my tech team and we discussed the features.” Speaking about the features, he added, “So the new site will have an ‘Add To Cart’ option. You can browse through the options (Boys/Girls) and add the ones you like in cart. If their bio matches your interest and if you feel that this is the right person, you can order that person and we will deliver him/her to your home. You can choose from various options with many filters such as city, height, color, income, Milind Soman lookalikes (for women) and Chitrangada Singh lookalikes (for men). You can also request to us if you want a particular person with same income but different height or a person with different figure but same caste. Also, plenty of customization options will be available. Moreover, we would offer a 7 day free trial for those who want to just know the other person or have an engagement. We will also offer cash on delivery option to those who have been deceived earlier by someone’s profile picture. For those who are sure of marriage or as I like to call them ‘desperate for sex’, we will offer card payments. We are closing our former website familypressure.com and we will make sure we redirect the traffic on familypressure.com to barbaadi.com.”By adding this feature, Mangal has surely gained a competitive advantage over his competitors. We now wait to see how Mangal will deal with returning, repair and replacement issues.',fake

'Chennai. The producers of the Diwali release Tamil movie ‘Mersal’, Sri Thenandal Films, has profoundly thanked both BJP and Congress for the success of the film. The extraordinary box office collection and the publicity worldwide & in India, across all the news channels and the other media, would not have been possible if it is not for the two national political parties fighting against each other, the producers told Faking News.Initially, the protest started from a few Tamilnadu BJP leaders against a few scenes in the movie where the protagonist, actor Vijay, speaks badly about Indian GST, compared to that of Singaporean tax system. The leaders accused that Vijay has political ambitions and his remarks in the movie are wrong and politically motivated. Then the national level leaders joined in. ‘It is only after OfficeOfRG tweeted about Mersal and against the PM, we see the highest box office collection’ the producers told Faking News.“Free publicity is what all the movie produces long for after every movie release. Do you know that we spend about 25\% of the movie’s budget on the promotions alone. When Mersal hashtag runs across all the news channels, local and national, we are overjoyed. When we hear about the @OfficeOfRG’s tweet, supporting the film goes viral, we plan to release the movie in Russia and Kazakhstan”, she further added.Meanwhile, the producers of ‘Indu Sarkar’ are planning on a re-release of the movie, owing to the sudden popularity of the movie, thanks to non-stop TV debate fights between Congress and BJP.',fake
'This is the most unlikely spokesperson for Donald Trump that one could imagine, perhaps only slightly less likely than Rosie O’Donnell. There are questions as to whether this is some type of promotion for one of his crappy movies or a compilation of clips taken out of context and reconstructed to deliver a different, pro-Trump message. Anything is possible but the flow of the video doesn’t seem as if it has been chopped up. It seems genuine, even if his motivations are not.\r\nHis comments on the thirty-five percent tariff on Ford’s built in Mexico is correct, although they may be trying to work around that by offering to build Broncos in the US at that facility. He takes the position of the beaten down middle class “working stiff,” calling Trump the Human Molotov Cocktail that they’ve been waiting for.\r\n\r\nHe’s “The human hand grenade that they can legally throw into the system that stole their lives from them.” He reminds this gathering of regular “Joe Blows” that on November 8th, they still have the one thing that the government hasn’t yet taken away from them, (though they have significantly diluted it through illegal immigration and fraud), their vote.  And with that vote, the people of the United States are going to elect Donald J. Trump as their president.”\r\n\r\nHe says the Americans will strike back against the very system that has overturned and ruined their lives. He points out that “the elites who ruined their lives hate Trump.

'Michael Savage Presents Evidence The Media Wants You To STAY HOME on 11/08/16Michael Savage comments on a WikiLeaks document drop that shows collusion between the Clinton campaign and the media to try and take out any opposition. He says, “That is something that was done and is done only in third-world dictatorships.Michael Savage notes that the US Navy is launching strikes against targets in Yemen after their failed attempts to sink three of our ships, but the media is bombarding us with incessant reporting that Donald Trump said some really naughty things.Is that what you’re supposed to worry about? Now the old hags are amazingly coming out of the woodwork to accuse him of groping them, groping them so many years ago. Why is it happening now? How come the very same offended media types had nothing to say when Bill Clinton was accused of raping several women and having many affairs right in the Oval Office?” He asks similar questions about the legendary womanizing of John F. Kennedy and about Ted “the drunk” Kennedy, who left Mary Jo Kopechne to drown after he ran a road and into a pond on  Chappaquiddick Island. He was still revered later as the “Lion of the Senate” in spite of having cowardly run off and left the dying woman until she was discovered the following day.Pointing to the hypocrisy of the left, Savage says, “You see the world is burning and it’s about to get worse. And we have a choice, Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. Who do you trust most with the country at this critical moment? He notes that many of his listeners have become disheartened because of the piling on that is taking place, “by the lowest of the human species, the Wolf Blitzers, the Jake Tappers. I can name them all, it doesn’t matter what I say about them, they are paid operatives of the Democrat socialist machine.”“They are leading you to believe that the election is already over,” says Savage. “They want you to believe that Trump can’t win. They want to dishearten you so that you don’t even vote because they know that the entire election hinges upon the voter turnout. Democrats understand that, that’s why they’re working the crowds.”He continues, “That’s why they’re working the gutters, that’s why they’re working the prisons, that’s why they’re working the swamps. That’s why the demon in the White House is flooding America with illegal aliens. That’s why they’ve eliminated voter ID, in order to get voter turnout for the most corrupt, criminal woman to have ever gotten this close to the White House.”“And what they want you to feel is that it’s over and you can’t win so why vote, while the exact opposite is true. Not only must you vote, you must actually get out the vote,” says Savage. “You must speak to others on the other side of the aisle, those of you who understand what is at stake. And you must tell them that everything is at stake, because the Democrats are practicing a scorched earth policy on America.”He adds, “And should she win, all Hell will break loose in this nation.”Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake

'Reports from all over the country are indicating voter fraud and intimidation, but one particularly egregious incident happened in East Lansing, Michigan.  Mother Jones provides this description from a voter at a synagogue:I observed a man just outside the door to the polling place. He pulled two women wearing Hijabs out of line ahead of me. When I came level to him, he was examining their voter registration cards and appeared to be attempting to direct them to another polling place. He seemed polite but I did not like that he’d singled out those two women…When I finished voting, there were two polling officials that were asking him to leave. He was refusing. He then entered the polling place, presumably to attempt to obtain permission to remain.According to the witness, the man doing the questioning of the women did not have any identification visible that he was an official with the elections commission, any campaign or any other authority.  A different witness came forward later claiming that the same man was questioning a black man asking what precinct he was registered in.The Ingham County elections authority took action.Fox reported the incident to Barb Byrum, the Ingham County Clerk, who told Mother Jones that she considered the incident “targeting individuals and harassing them and trying to convince them that they shouldn’t be voting.” She said the East Lansing city clerk reported the incident to the police. “It doesn’t pass the smell test…so it needed to be addressed by law enforcement,” Byrum said.Fox’s brother Alan, a member of the Ingham County Board of Canvassers, said the local Democratic Party sent poll watchers to the synagogue following the report. According to Ron Fox, his brother said that “presumably this was to ensure the person in question, or others did not return.” Both Alan Fox and Byrum said they had received no other reports of voter intimidation in the city or county so far on Tuesday.Voter intimidation is a serious offence no matter which way it happens, and to do so based on race just affirms the stereotypes that the left pushes on whites.',fake

These friends/ followers along with content can be transferred to the original account till 31st December 2016.”Here are some of the highlights of the historic speech:1. No content can be posted / tweeted / shared / re-tweeted from the anonymous/fake account after 12 am of 9th Nov.2. The content of the anonymous account can be transferred by submitting an original DP/ original name. The last date for the same is 31st Dec.3.

'In a massive development in the world of board gaming, American toys and gaming brand Hasbro has announced that it will be coming up with its own Indian version of their child company Parker brothers’ cult classic business board game, Monopoly. Cashing in on PM Narendra Modi’s recent shell-shockingly bold move of invalidating currency notes of the ?500 and ?1000 denomination, Hasbro has announced that for the first time in the board game’s history, real notes of these denominations will be used.“HUGE ANNOUNCEMENT: India, we’re coming soon to you guys, with your own version of Monopoly! Say goodbye to Boardwalk, Vermont, Park Place, Ventnor etc etc. You will soon see Connaught Place, Park Street, Marine Drive, Anna Salai, Silk Board and so on, along with a dozen places that belong to Robert Vadra and DLF! And guess what? For the first time in the history of this classic board game, we will be using real notes for ?500 and ?1000! So this is an open offer to you all – please send us all your notes of these denominations and we will transfer the corresponding amount to you online! Avail this historic opportunity!” Hasbro CEO Brian Goldner announced.Goldner added that it’s not just the properties that would be Indian. “There will be a ‘Go to Tihar Jail’ box at one of the corners. There will also be a ‘Get out of Tihar Jail free’ card with Sanjay Dutt’s face on it. As for the vehicles players would use, we will have a bullock cart, a Bajaj Chetak, a Maruti 800 and so on. And guess what – there will be no notes for denominations of ?1 and ?5! True to the Indian spirit, we will have Eclairs chocolates and 5-star bars in our game banks. The deal with Cadburys will be finalized soon. We’ll make this game as Indian as it can possibly get, all you folks as well as your illegal Bangladeshi immigrants are going to love it!” the CEO told The UnReal Times.According to sources, Hasbro is likely to be helped by Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd in the distribution of the game. “Oh I absolutely love Monopoly, I just can’t have enough of it!” Ambani reportedly smiled while discussing the deal with Goldner. Hasbro is also said to have been approached by NCP supremo Sharad Pawar for the supply of currency notes in the state of Maharashtra. Sources in Tamil Nadu added that the ruling AIADMK wanted special ‘Amma’ currency notes for the game packs distributed in Tamil Nadu, but their request was reportedly turned down by Goldner.The announcement has drawn reactions from across the border too. While Pakistan has warned Hasbro of including any property from Kashmir in the game, China has issued a similar warning to not include any property from Arunachal Pradesh. From the center of the country, a letter by the Rashtreeya Swayamsevak Sangh has urged the brand to include other countries like Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka etc and make the game set in Akhand Bharat as opposed to being India-specific.Regardless though, Monopoly India is all set to be officially launched soon at the office of the BJP’s Margdarshak Mandal. “Joshi bhai, Yashwant bhai and I are greatly looking forward to this! Will be quite a change from the usual Rummy or Bridge,” BJP patriarch LK Advani, who recently turned 89, sniffed.',fake
'MSNBC as a network is not exactly known for its objectivity. In fact, the programming there is so ideologically in the tank for the political left, tirelessly working to get Democrats elected, that the only people watching the network are doing so for the echo chamber effect.Every now and then, though, the cast of MSNBC’s Morning Joe – the early morning folks who appear with Joe Scarborough, and New World Order princess Mika Brzezinski – have a come to Jesus moment.  On Monday, October 31, after a weekend of pre-election bombshells that have the full American political contingent reaching for popcorn and chips, Mika expressed her disbelief in how the Democratic Party could be so hypocritical as to berate Republicans for nominating a non-traditional candidate when they nominated a woman under federal investigation for multiple felonies.  Not only that, Mika and Joe seem genuinely stunned at the turn of opinion and editorial slant from the pundit class. Watch:This is very much Mika’s “coulda been a contenda” moment.  The actors in the most famous scene in one of the most important films in the American treasury always said that the scene would not have worked without using disbelief.  When Mika talks about a “self-inflicted wound” she cannot believe Hillary Clinton was so stupid as to not only set up a private server, but that in the wake of the fallout from the bad publicity, and a re-opened investigation, the former Secretary of State is taking down a whole lot of people who stuck their necks out for her.No network covered for Hillary like MSNBC.  Not CNN.  Not the alphabet soup nets.  And, of late, not even Fox distorted reporting to push the Democratic candidates like MSNBC.Mika is absolutely right, when it comes to the mainstream media and how the Hillary Clinton email server story has been spun.  No one believes the meme that James Comey’s wife talked him into “doing the right thing,” although she may have had some influence.  Something in the background changed, and THAT is why the FBI is now looking at over 600,000 emails found on a computer that had nothing to do with the original investigation.  What that something is remains to be seen.In the meantime, the folks at MSNBC are showing us that from time to time, the media will eat its own.

'A Mumbai man purchased a lavish, sea-facing apartment in the posh Bandstand area of Bandra after he avoided ordering samosa while watching movie at a Juhu multiplex. The man, identified as Irfan Sheikh, went to watch Judwaa 2 along with his wife at a Juhu multiplex on Saturday night, where the incident took place.Narrating the episode in his newly-bought Bandra house, Sheikh said, “By twice sending an attendant during the movie, they tried to ensure that I give up on my dreams of buying a new house, but I was adamant that I will not buy a samosa there.” Sheikh noticed that the attendant tried to lure him by bringing samosa near his mouth when he refused to buy one. “He also offered a free samosa to the movie-goer on my left after he ordered many popcorns and cold drinks, just to tempt me,” said Sheikh. His wife, who felt hungry, paid a hefty amount for the sandwich she ordered during the interval. “Had I not ordered a sandwich at the multiplex, we could have bought a bigger apartment today,” she said, regretting her decision of arriving hungry at the cinema hall. We also spoke to the ultra-rich man who was offered a free samosa during the movie. Recalling the incident, he said, “I tried selling the samosa outside the multiplex so I could buy myself a luxury car with that money, but I couldn’t fetch more than Rs 10 for it—and the difference of the prices is unbelievable. I feel looted.”Sheikh, who went to watch Judwaa 2, thanked his wife for ordering the sandwich during the interval. “After taking the bill for the sandwich, I tried studying how GST is calculated. In an attempt to do so, I fortunately missed the entire post-interval portion of Judwaa 2 and saved money I would have had to spend on Disprin,” said an ecstatic Sheikh. ',fake

'Every time Donald Trump gives a speech, the breadth and depth of his knowledge and understanding of the American situation is astounding.  He cuts to the chase and gives the people a clear-headed, plainly spoken version of reality that puts all the Ivy League wordsmiths’ teeth on edge.In one recent speech, all it took was five minutes.  Five minutes to lay out the reality of what the people in charge of the nation are up to.  Five minutes to cheerlead the American people who feel powerless against that tag team.  The people at #TrumpTheEstablishment put his words against the images that all of us who follow politics away from CNN, ABC, NBC, and CBS know.  The results speak for themselves.Remember, the world of power and influence is the one from which Donald Trump comes.  The system is that which he had to navigate in order to make his fortune.  He knows what has been done to the United States.  He watched as the American people started the descent into poverty.  He recognizes that “free trade” is inherently anti-American when every other country has prohibitively high tariffs on American goods and we have none on theirs.  He knows that unnecessary wars are prohibitively expensive, especially when we are fighting just to have a war going on.  He gets the concept that regulation strangles the small business owner.All of the things that Republicans over the years have talked about, but have done nothing to change come out in his messaging – and word is getting out despite the mainstream media’s manipulation of Trump’s rally optics.  This is a man who is believably for the people, not against them.  And when he says that only the American people can change the corruption, we just want to believe him.Michael Moore is correct.  The American people are about to give a gigantic middle finger to the establishment.  Can’t say they haven’t been warned.',fake

'It’s some seedy activity, a common thing for Democrat politicians. Almost half a million dollars went to a campaign that didn’t even exist before sugar daddy Terry McAuliffe came up with the idea to use it as a means of funneling bribe money. The Virginia governor, a longtime Clinton ally, obviously coordinated with the Executive branch in providing a campaign fund for Dr. Jill McCabe as well as a promotion for her husband. In that position he had oversight of the investigation into the criminality of Hillary Clinton. Once Mr. McCabe was in his new elevated position following the payment of the cash, all he had to do was carry out his part of the deal, the sale of his position and influence in a manner that would make Hillary Clinton and Obama proud, and with it, his supposed integrity.Judge Napolitano explains that, while there might not be anything technically illegal with what was done, it smells bad, even rank, of corruption and conflict of interest. He said, “Well, no, it is not against the law, I mean under Virginia law Governor McAuliffe can make contributions of that magnitude, from a variety of entities that he controlled to Dr. McCabe.” He notes that also under the law, “Andrew McCabe, as the number two person in the FBI, can supervise the investigation of Mrs. Clinton.”Having dispensed with the technical, Napolitano say, “But there is the appearance of impropriety. There is the appearance that he was aware of the relationship of Terry McAuliffe to the Clintons and that makes it look like his decisions would be colored by his wishes to please the people that are behind the person who gave this money to his wife.” The good judge goes out of his way to tiptoe around the obvious.Asked what McCabe should have done, Napolitano says, “He should have excused himself from the case, because as a lawyer, he has the duty to avoid the ‘appearance of impropriety’ and the appearance of impropriety here is profound.” Napolitano notes that “we learned this had happened from a tip from several FBI agents who were part of the team that had investigated Mrs. Clinton, who believe that their work was destroyed by management in the FBI.” He adds, “We really have a situation here that looks terrible.”Governor John Sununu describes what happened as another defining example of the culture of corruption that the Clintons have brought to the Democrat Party for the last quarter century. Since 1992 they’ve infused this culture of corruption and it is now reaching into the FBI, which used to be one of the most hallowed and respected institutions in the US government.Sununu describes her denial of any impropriety absolute garbage and notes that while no law may have been technically broken, there is indisputable corruption. Bill Hemmer notes the campaign, which the wife lost, totaled approximately $1.8 million dollars. Sununu agrees that it is a lot of money for a state office seat and points out that almost half of it was funded by the Clintons. “And you don’t think they’re planning ahead in how to influence the process? This is corruption in the Democrat Party. This election has to be an election of change and throwing out this party that has, even the ‘president’ of the United States today was nurtured and promoted by the corrupt political system in Chicago.”Sununu failed to make another point, one that ties in with the corruption of the occupier of the Oval Office, the promotion of McCabe was an Obama decision that required his authorization.

The movie is titled A Wednesday: Re-Modified, and is centered on PM Modi’s masterstroke to abolish Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes.The protagonist is an old chai wallah who is frustrated after serving chais from morning to evening to affluent people. The poor chai wallah is highly irritated when people emerge from luxurious cars offer notes of 500 and 1000 to him and ask “Chacha Chuttey kar do”. He sees it as a mockery to his honest profession at the hands of people who have no worth of Gandhi’s ideals or his currency notes.Tired of large currency notes and the people who flaunt them he climbs to the roof top of an under construction building and calls the RBI Governor to share his ‘Man ki Baat’. He asks the governor to ban 500 and 1000 currency notes from Wednesday onwards. If not, he would detonate bombs kept in Chaipatti dabbas delivered as a Diwali gift by him to all banks in the city. The conversation that ensues is as below:(Disclaimer: This conversation is in Hindi)Chai Wallah (CW): Aapke ghar me cockroach aata hai to aap kya karte hai Governor saab.Aap unko paalte nahi maartey hain.

'Asanshol, November 31st.In a startling incident, a budding playback singer resting under a portrait of Kishore Kumar in the recording studio got a mysterious, tight slap today.“It was spooky”, gasped Bitto (whose real name is Bewda Autotunerwallah), the rising star. “I’d just finished recording the re-mixed version of the remixed version of the evergreen melody ‘Pal pal dil ke paas…‘. Just before that I’d recorded similarly re-mixed versions of the re-mixed versions of other evergreens like ‘Dil me chhupa loonga…‘ and even ‘Mahi ve‘. I’m a teetotaller and hence was exhausted after the marathon sessions of singing in an sleepy-constipated-drunkard’s voice to give my voice the “right” feel. I was grabbing a nap on the chair below Kishoreda’s portrait in the empty waiting hall, and all of a sudden I got the tightest slap I’ve ever got in my life. I swear, there was no one around. Just me and the portrait. Could it really have been….?” his voice tapered off, his right cheek swollen and ear still buzzing with an audible beep from the trauma.Too good to sound true, this reporter attempted to contact the spirit of the timeless mercurial legend with some help from the internet. In a major breakthrough, the Kishoreda’s spirit made a “connect” with this reporter and conveyed the frustrations of the legends of bygone eras. “Spirits really don’t exist, but solely for this one reason, God has made an exception”, he said. “SD, Panchamda, and a score of illustrious playback singers and lyricists have conveyed their frustrations over the rape of their legacies over the last few years- especially even the credits being usurped by these good-for-nothing-unoriginal-thankless-young chaps. I felt a wee bit disappointed after slapping that young man earlier today, but please understand that it was on behalf of our entire generation from the 70?s and 80?s… and no one else but me would probably do it. All those pent-up emotions were concentrated in that slap, hence it was way much tighter than I’d intended. It’s not just about copyright… its about the art. I hope you understand”.Last heard, several scared new-age singers and composers were scurrying to get photos of yesteryears’ legends off the walls in their homes and studios; some complained of sore bottoms and discovered photos of their “idols” in their wallets, which they promptly got rid of. A few, on the other hand, were seen doing silent “aartis” (sans their singing) to the photos, in a bid to placate emotions.“It’s like overnight demonetisation for us new-age musicians”, commented a notorious plagiariser-cum-jugde of several reality shows. This is going to cause serious inconvenience to the common man. Imagine their sorry plight when they’ll be forced to listen to our original tunes 24×7! They’ll soon beg for mercy” he sneered.As per preliminary statistics, song output in Bollywood is expected to drop by 86\% over the next few weeks, hopefully marking an end of a mindless era of stolen ‘inspired’ works.',fake
'On the eve of the 2016 presidential election, Fox News is reporting some explosive information on the September 11, 2012 attack on the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya, where four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens, were killed.  It seems that the contractor hired to do security at the facility did not vet their employees like tried and true American companies would have done, and ended up with a bunch of terrorists “guarding” the American compound.The explosive charge against Wales-based Blue Mountain Group comes from several sources, including an independent security specialist who has implemented training programs at U.S. Consulates around the world, including in Benghazi, where he trained a local militia that preceded Blue Mountain. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Blue Mountain used local newspaper ads to assemble a team of 20 guards, many of whom had terror ties, after securing a $9.2 million annual contract.“The guards who were hired were locals who were part of the Ansar al-Sharia and Al Qaeda groups operating in Benghazi,” said the source, whose assignment in Benghazi had ended in November 2011. “Whoever approved contracts at the State Department hired Blue Mountain Group and then allowed Blue Mountain Group to hire local Libyans who were not vetted.”Many were members of the Libyan government-financed February 17th Martyrs Brigade, an Islamist militia that had previously guarded Americans before being replaced by Blue Mountain.John “Tig” Tiegen, one of the CIA contractors that responded to the Sept. 11, 2012 attack and co-author of “13 Hours: The Inside Account of What Really Happened in Benghazi,” confirmed to Fox News that the local Libyans who attacked the consulate that night included guards working for Blue Mountain.“Many of the local Libyans who attacked the consulate on the night of Sept. 11, 2012, were the actual  guards that the State Department under Hillary Clinton hired to protect the Consulate in Benghazi,” Tiegen told Fox News. “The guards were unvetted and were locals with basically no background at all in providing security. Most of them never had held a job in security in the past.“Blue Mountain Libya, at the time of being awarded the contract by our State Department, had no employees so they quickly had to find people to work, regardless of their backgrounds,” he said.But, according to all the reports, the “guards” did have terrorist ties.The Fox News article goes on to discuss various reports including one from the State Department that says while Blue Mountain fighters did not execute their jobs correctly, they did not participate in the attack itself, a statement contradicted by witnesses on the ground.  There is also a question as to why Blue Mountain was hired when they were not well known in the security industry and even were rushed into service.According to government records obtained by the Washington-based Judicial Watch, the State Department was in a “rush” to hire Blue Mountain UK, and its affiliate, Blue Mountain Libya, which together formed The Blue Mountain Group to secure the Benghazi contract.“I understand there was a tremendous rush to get the original contract awarded, and the Service level agreement was most likely overlooked in the rush,” wrote State Department contracting officer Jan Visintainer, in a June 6, 2012, email. Emails obtained from [missing word] after the attack showed Visintainer urged Blue Mountain officials not to talk to the media.Blue Mountain UK was formed in 2008 by David Nigel Thomas, a former Special Air Service official. Charles Tiefer, a commissioner at the Commission on Wartime Contracting, told Reuters the company was not well known.“Blue Mountain was virtually unknown to the circles that studied private security contractors working for the United States, before the events in Benghazi,” Tiefer said.',fake
'According to the latest poll done on the African-American voter, a huge twist improves Trumps chances for a victory.  The media stated that Trump only received 3 \% of black votes and it turns out their wrong!  The liberal media has a plan to smash Trump with the black votes by making them believe he’s racist but their plan has apparently failed.  Black vote for Trump has increased and is surging.It’s amazing, to see that the latest Rasmussen poll has Trump ahead 43\% to 41\% over Hillary among likely voters. The truth is buried in the demographic area.Twenty percent of African-American voters in Florida support Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump according to a poll released Wednesday by Florida Atlantic University.Gateway Pundit shows the increase by percent in Rasmussen Poll. Black likely voters for Trump (Rasmussen Poll)Oct 3 – 9\%\r\n Oct 6 – 12\%\r\n Oct 7 – 13\%\r\n Oct 10 – 14\%\r\n Oct 11 – 19\%\r\n Oct 12 – 19\%\r\n Oct 13 – 24\%',fake
'Right in the middle of FBI director James Comey letting Congress know that he was reviewing yet MORE emails in relation to the Hillary Clinton investigation, James O’Keefe at Project Veritas released ANOTHER hidden cam video. This one begins with undercover footage from the office of Media Matters, former conservative David Brock’s operation that just happens to be backed by George Soros.  This one is a little different, and allows Roger Stone to get the message out of what is being done to him by the puppetmaster and his minions.Bragging about ruining people’s careers is just…mean.  And getting Lou Dobbs off CNN was a boon to Fox, even if he comes off as naive from time to time.  Glenn Beck off of Fox…no great loss.Of all of the Project Veritas videos to be released, this one may well be the most demonstrative. The actual victims of the organization targeting them get to address the very group that destroyed them. Think what you will of Roger Stone and Alex Jones, but that is powerful. It also proves that the “conspiracy theory” people are being pummeled and defamed most likely to hide their actual message.  If that’s the case, what they have to say may not be so far-fetched after all.Between WikiLeaks (which put out yet ANOTHER cache of Podesta emails today), Project Veritas, and now the FBI reviewing more emails, keeping up with all this news and digesting the scandals less than two weeks before the election is going to be a challenge.  We in the alternative media and blogosphere will do our best to bring all the information to the readers, but it’s not going to be easy.  There’s just too much of it.The October surprises just keep coming, and there is no sign that it’s going to let up any time soon.',fake

'New Delhi: Ever since the launch of Arnab Goswami’s news channel ‘Republic TV’, an ‘exposé race’ has begun among all news channels. As the sun sets every day, the exposé battle begins with each channel trying to outdo the others in terms of sensationalism. Worried that they are getting left behind due to lack of any exclusive exposé, a Delhi based news channel decided to expose the golgappa seller outside their office.The channel played the explosive sting video this evening that clearly showed the golgappa seller refuse the rightful demand of a sookha wala by the paying customers. This explosive video has shook up the entire golgappa industry with the golgappa association members distancing themselves from this stall’s owner.Proud of their sting, the channel’s chief editor said ,”I am very proud of my team for breaking this sookha wala scam. Initially when our investigative reporters told me about this scam, I didn’t believe them. How can anyone refuse sookha wala at the end of a golgappa session but when I saw the video, I was blown away with it. We believe this could be a scam worth dozens of rupees every day. Rest assured, we will not move on from this news till we make sure that everyone concerned doesn’t pay for their crimes.”When we asked how is this a crime, the editor said ,”Oh come on. This practice of asking for a sookha wala is 75 yrs old, therefore, refusing to serve it is unconstitutional. We can’t let such acts go unpunished.”When asked if they are doing such exposés because other channels have left them behind, he said ,”I don’t care what the competition is doing. In fact, they are only covering news about individual states where as I am going for a national issue. Golgappa, phuchka, pani puri, paani ka batasha, whatever it is called in your state, I am going to get you that sookha wala at the end of it.”As per our sources inside the channel, their next exposé will be against vegetable vendors denying free dhaniya-mirchi. ',fake
'The moment we have all been waiting for since Colin Kaepernick took a knee for the National Anthem at an NFL preseason game may well have arrived.  People at the New American did some digging and found the provision in the advertising contracts that determines how the National Football League must compensate sponsors if the ratings suffer for any reason:The ad rates for a 30-second televised commercial during a game cost from $500,000 to $600,000 for prime-time games. However, if ratings are not up to a certain level, the ad contracts stipulate that the networks must essentially give free commercial time to make up for that decline. This in turn will rile the TV networks that broadcast the games (CBS, FOX, NBC, and ESPN), and may even lead to a renegotiation of the contracts — thereby bringing in less revenue for the owners to use to pay their players.Oops.One player, Brandon Marshall of the Denver Broncos, has already seen the results of sitting out the National Anthem.  Two of his sponsors DROPPED him.He lost not only his endorsement contract with Air Academy Federal Credit Union, but another contract with CenturyLink. CenturyLink explained, “We completely respect Brandon Marshall’s personal decision and right to take an action to support something in which he strongly believes. America is anchored in the right of individuals to express their beliefs. While we acknowledge Brandon’s right, we also believe that whatever issues we face, we also occasionally must stand together to show our allegiance to our common bond as a nation. In our view, the national anthem is one of those moments. For this reason, while we wish Brandon the best this season, we are politely terminating our agreement with him.”Fans this season, for reasons that are still not clear to the NFL high brass even if they are crystal clear to everyone else, have been tuning out resulting in a drop in the ratings game for five straight weeks.  By double digits.  As explained above, that means the advertisers lose money.  Due to that, the NFL must compensate the sponsors with free ad time – a missed revenue opportunity.  Will this cost the owners of the franchises enough to change the NFL’s National Anthem policies?  Only time will tell.',fake
'For weeks now, as the NFL prime time ratings have come in and they’ve been less than stellar, confusion has reigned in the halls of the once vaunted sports league.  What could POSSIBLY be causing this, executives of both the league and the television networks dependent on the revenue from advertising during the games ask.  What is making people tune out?Inside the league, and among the sportscasters, the reasons this is so are not exactly reflective of the comments one sees in social media, and on blog posts and news stories.  The people wrapped up on the inside of the game blame:And on and on.  The reasoning centers around the product.  In some ways, that is refreshing in that the league recognizes that what is on the field has to be entertaining to hold an audience’s interest.  On the other hand, it ignores the elephant in the room of Colin Kaepernick sitting out the national anthem to protest police brutality and oppression of minorities, two national memes that millions of Americans see as being social engineering by George Soros.  The ratings began to fall as soon as that protest happened and took hold.  Fans everywhere commented on public forums that they were done with the league after that.  And how does the league respond?  From Bloomberg:In the preseason, Kaepernick began sitting down or taking a knee during the singing of the national anthem to protest police injustice and the oppression of black people in the U.S. The protests have since been adopted, in one form or another, by other players around the league, which has drawn praise from plenty of fans and sportswriters. But within the world of conservative talk radio and websites, Kaepernick now ranks up there in the bugaboo pantheon with George Soros and Benghazi.Which says that the NFL does not know its fan base very well.  Many Americans who are very much enthusiasts of the game at any level are not part of the “blame America for every ill” crowd. In fact, just the opposite.  In backing Kaepernick, the high gurus of the NFL and sports broadcasting put their money on the wrong horse, and killed their golden goose.The powers that be will deny it, but the demise of the NFL’s television ratings are a direct result of not rebuking Kaepernick.  The double digit drops in television ratings for the prime time broadcasts did not start until that happened despite waning popularity of the sport in recent years.  Yes, there are numerous issues that the National Football League can and should look at to improve the product both on and off the field, but they need to remember that sports is an escape from reality for fans, not a vehicle to try to shape it.  And when dependent on customers for revenue, it is never a good idea to insult them or their sense of patriotism even if some people connected to the league brush off concern.Lee Berke, president and chief executive officer of consulting firm LHB Sports, Entertainment & Media, believes the drop in audience is largely illusory and that people are overreacting. “You’re looking at 20 years of growth, and everybody is talking about four or five games,” he says. “There are fluctuations in election years and whether you have certain players around. But overall it’s been a substantial increase and retention of audience in the midst of virtually every other category of programming falling off—from sitcoms, to dramas, to movies. The NFL is very resilient.”That remains to be seen.  In this writer’s hometown, the NFL is dead.  It may well be dying in many other locales.  We’ll see what happens with the ratings now that the World Series is over and after the election takes place.',fake
'Nigel Farage, the man who championed the successful Brexit bid of the UK to free themselves of the globalist bonds of the EU, gives his perspective and advice on the mess that Donald Trump now finds himself in heading into the Sunday debate.He says of the debate, “It’s going to be pretty ugly tomorrow” and laments how “the big policy stuff, the extent to which big businesses and big banks have been taking us in a direction which is bad for ordinary people” will be bumped down the agenda as the discussion shifts more towards personality.Farage labels the Trump video comments as alpha-male boasting, “It’s the kind of thing, if we’re being honest, that men do. They sit around and have a drink and they talk like this.” He notes that quite a lot of women similarly say things among themselves that they would not want to see on Fox News or on the front page of newspapers.Cavuto asks about the Republicans who are beating a drum to remove Trump from the ticket, saying this is what happens in politics, people look after their own interests. Unfortunately, something he doesn’t point out, is that’s the same thing those in Congress do after they’re elected as well.  What’s best for the people is rarely the focus.Farage notes that while it’s not good for Trump right now, there are a whole host of stories coming out about both of the crooked Clintons. He says if he were Donald Trump going into the debate, he would apologize for his boorish comments and then make every effort to redirect the conversation back to what matters, “America’s place in the world, security, people’s incomes, manufacturing industry.”Farage says, “I think Trump needs to get this, if he possibly can tomorrow, back onto the issues. And when he talks about the issues, there are millions of people out there in America, who haven’t voted for years, who are talking to each other, saying, ‘hey, this guy is saying what we’re saying.\'”They agree that there is an honesty about Trump, that you know what you’re getting. With Clinton everything is a deception, a lie, and a crooked deal that benefits her and her fellow criminals. Farage adds, “You know what, he’s not running to be Pope, he’s running to be president of the USA. Every human being is flawed. If his flaws are all out there and if the public has suspicions that they haven’t heard all of Hillary’s, in a week’s time this may not look as bad as it does this morning.”Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'KANPUR: Demonetisation’s real picture has emerged with the appearance of the One currency note in the denomination of rupees two thousand with a tape in the middle and half printed— with half of the note just a piece of blank white paper. This odd note came out after the customer’s withdrawal of the currency notes from the automatic teller machine. Just as this invalid note was half white paper and half pink paper, the upshot of the demonetisation remained positive and negative in one time-consuming year.Despite the completion of the twelve months of this historic decision, there are prevailing two distinct views. One thinking is that it is a good move for our economy. The hydra-headed monster of the black money has been condensed and use of paperless transaction has increased. However, the critics are not accepting the sudden move as encouraging. They have even equated it with the emergency. One journalist during the course of discussion on the television channel pointed out when he asked the vegetable dealer to accept the payment through the Paytm he denied. When enquired of the payment receipt he further expressed denial, the dealer was bent upon oral dealing.It cleared the fact that there was a scant expansion of the paperless currency. While another participant in the capacity of the Vyapar Sangh office-bearer told that the traders were still not educated enough to pick up the advanced mode of transactions. However, he was suggested by the programme anchor to follow the new changes, he countered how could one grasp high school level learning in absence of lower level schooling. Undeniably, the journalist was correct in supporting the families whose members had died owing to the note ban. He suggested the politicians to at least go to those affected houses in order to know their well-being.',fake
'New Delhi: Jantar Mantar is seeing a new type of protest this week. KG-class school students in a private school are now marching to Delhi’s popular demonstration site, demanding reservations in school punishments. They feel some punishments like “write your name 100 times” are biased, and should be replaced with “stand up on the bench”.The recent incident that triggered this protest, saw two students in KG class of Delhi’s Jan Ekta Public School being punished for not doing homework, by being made to write their names a 100 times each. While the punishment sounded fair to the teacher, since it’s been used in India for generations, the problem was their names itself. One boy’s name was Ramachandran Shivaswami Subramaniam, while the other boy’s name was Om Das.Naturally, Om Das finished his punishment in very quick time, while Ramachandran Shivaswami Subramaniam took much longer, not to mention his writing hand was aching much more. Following this incident, he raised the matter to CM Kejriwal, who, being the expert on demonstrations, suggested he march to Jantar Mantar with his fellow students demanding reservations in school punishments.Protesting KG class students have demanded that students with long names should not be punished by being asked to write their names, rather, punishment should be a ‘level-playing field’, like, “standing up on the bench” or “getting out of the class”, that treat all students equally. “Write your name 100 times” should only be reserved for students whose name have less than 10 alphabets.',fake

'Inspired by PM Modi’s gutsy decision to demonetize Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes and by the generally positive reaction of the Indian public, Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif too decided to abolish high denomination currency notes and win back public favour. After a quick meeting with the Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, PM Sharif, like his Indian counterpart, decided to announce his decision in a nationally televised address to the nation.“Bhaiyon aur behnon!” he roared, adopting a tone similar to Modi’s, “there comes a time in the history of a country’s development when a need is felt for a strong and decisive step. For years, this country has felt that corruption, black money and terrorism are festering sores, holding us back in the race towards development. Terrorism is a frightening threat.

When there are 1.25 billion people living together, there will be difference of opinions, but we need to resolve our differences amicably, because at the end of the day, we are one big family.”“Anyway, that was a good decision. So, whom did you support in the US election?”“Hillary Clinton.”“Was it because of Trump’s anti-Muslim statements or was there any other reason behind it?”“No, no other reason. He is a racist and that’s why I did not support him. If I had a voter Id card, I would’ve voted against him,” his eyes darted towards a poster of Madonna on the wall in his living room as we concluded the interview.',fake
'Trump: The orchestration is obvious as is the intent by the establishment politicians to discredit and destroy Mr. Trump. He’s the obstacle to their being able to complete the destruction of this nation so they’ll do whatever it takes to eliminate him.If Obama had put this much effort into fighting ISIS or really stimulating the economy he’d actually be leaving behind a legacy of accomplishment rather than dismal failure and anti-American subterfuge. But Obama views our destruction as his successful legacy and Clinton as being destined for even more “greatness.”The unconfirmed allegations are nothing most Americans care about. Certainly Democrats, with their history packed with perpetrating, defending and intimidating in the name of rape and other criminality couldn’t care less if it were one of their own. They are, however, anxious to hypocritically disparage Mr. Trump for things which cannot be proven and are either insignificant compared to what they have done or which may never have even happened.Paul Ryan, as we are learning, likely played a role, along with NBC and the Washington Post, in the release of the bus video. The timing of his dismissal of Mr. Trump appears to have been coordinated with an invitation to speak in order to create the opportunity to rescind it and a public act of disavowal. Then the rest of the establishment GOP as well as their sister organization, the Democrat Party, joined in the preplanned feeding frenzy.The next logical and quite predictable step in the Trump vilification process is an attack by the New York Times. That came today, with the sudden “revelation” of new mystery women who claim to have had unwanted physical encounters with Mr. Trump decades ago. This is the same Clinton advocacy rag that published false stories in May which stated that women had supposedly been demeaned by Mr. Trump.Several of the women, including Rowanne Brewer Lane, who was featured in the first false story, came forward and not only denied the accusations against Mr. Trump, but also noted that the reporters had lied to them, having promised it would not be a hit piece.Once again Hillary Clinton’s “Birdcage Liner of Record” is attacking Mr. Trump, although this time they’re using much less attractive women, making their claims even less believable. Trump has always been surrounded by beautiful women. Unless they are alleging he was performing charity work, the topic should be a dead, not-starter.We’re supposed to believe that the obvious liberal, who looks like a cross between EPA administrator Gina McCarthy and Burgess Meredith, some kind of larvae-eating environmentalist with hair clips in her armpits, would have been invited to sit in the first class section of the airplane. It’s possible that she was bumped up, even possible that Mr. Trump was actually on the plane. It’s also possible that he was not or that she was moved to a different seat across from him. He could have been the one who rebuffed her advances; perhaps apologizing and informing her that he’s heterosexual, before realizing his error.The woman, Jessica Leeds, claims Mr. Trump was “like an octopus, all over her,” but states that if he had just confined his groping to her breasts she would not have minded. She said, “If he had stuck with the upper part of the body I might not have gotten that upset. It’s when he started putting his hand up my skirt.” So she’s fine with being groped as long as the groper stays within the acceptable groping guidelines. Weren’t those commonly kept in the seat back of the chair in front or is that only in coach? And were they kissing during this encounter? It’s unusual for groping to take place without there being some other type of “getting to know each other” happening at the same time. Did she lead him on and doesn’t want to tell that part of the tale for fear of minimizing its negative impact?Leeds was so upset that she just got up and left, without ever saying a word and went back to her original seat. She never mentioned the event for decades, until the time came around for her to tell her story in support of her candidate, Hillary Clinton.Then suddenly new feelings of selective outrage started bubbling up all to the surface so she just had to let them out, and it had to be done with the New York Times. But she’s not to blame for failing to report a crime when it happened. It was due to her leftist conditioning, says Leeds. She said that during her time in business, in the 1970s and early 1980s, “We accepted it for years. We were taught it was our fault.”What? She was taught that if someone gropes her on an airplane it’s her fault. Is it because she’s been told she’s so irresistible or was it her ear-high mini-skirt that showed all the goods when she sat down, the fashion of the day. It’s odd that the crack New York Times reporters didn’t include anything about what she was wearing in the story, not that it would have made any difference. Trump says it didn’t happen and the New York Times has zero credibility.A second Hillary Clinton supporter has also come forward offering a similar tale from a time long ago in a land far, far away – in Trump Tower. She claims he was overcome by her charms as well and kissed her on the mouth in a hallway but nobody noticed. The owner of the building and the company is getting frisky in the hall and it’s not seen by anyone? Like Ms. Leeds, that woman also was so outraged that she never reported the incident to the police or her employer.Their dubious accusations both happened to surface at precisely the same, most opportune time, when they would be most advantageous for the Clinton/Ryan/Establishment/Globalist alliance to inflict maximum damage against Mr. Trump. The veracity of the accusations isn’t important, after all. The claims just need to be heard and believed for the pro-Clinton ploy to have been successful.

'True to his word, James O’Keefe of Project Veritas delivered yet another video to the world telling the tale of how back door politics works.  Yes, it is very much a pay to play kind of thing, and in video #4 of the Project Veritas series, the James O’Keefe crew explains a little more of how they managed to get all that undercover video. Yes, it’s sneaky, underhanded…and what undercover journalism is really all about.Isn’t it amazing what can happen when cash greases the right palms? New jobs, immigration lawyers, access to Hillary, etc. Also what seems to be amazing is just how much of the information that came out in the WikiLeaks John Podesta emails seems to be part of the James O’Keefe videos.It’s as if the Clinton Campaign, and the political action committees were actually working together. Thanks to all the whistleblowers, we now have proof that they are.And then there was this:In an unexpected twist, AUFC president Brad Woodhouse, the recipient of the $20,000, heard that Project Veritas Action was releasing undercover videos exposing AUFC’s activities. He told a journalist that AUFC was going to return the twenty thousand dollars.Woodhouse said it was because they were concerned that it might have been an illegal foreign donation. Project Veritas Action was pleased but wondered why that hadn’t been a problem for the month they had the money.Good question.  (For those who know they’ve seen Brad Woodhouse, but can’t quite place his face, THIS happened almost two years ago on C-Span.)The last two weeks of the 2016 presidential election campaign promise to be one October surprise after another – and it’s almost November.  The Clinton campaign is not going to give up with the dirty tricks and it is up to We the People to continue to ignore them and report any voting irregularities we see. ',fake
'It’s back to the future for George Orwell fans and those who understand that Walter Cronkite was a communist.  The current Occupier of the Oval Office, Barry Soetoro, aka Barack Obama, has declared that the wild, wild west of American media should cease to exist.  Instead of a mish mosh of facts, truth, and decried “conspiracy theories” that are turning out to be more and more credible, we the people should look to some sort of fact curating function:“We are going to have to rebuild within this wild-wild-west-of-information flow some sort of curating function that people agree to,” Obama said at an innovation conference in Pittsburgh.“There has to be, I think, some sort of way in which we can sort through information that passes some basic truthiness tests and those that we have to discard, because they just don’t have any basis in anything that’s actually happening in the world,” Obama added.Call it what you will, Ministry of Truth, Pravda, Double Speak, Office of Propaganda, Obama and whoever is pulling his puppet strings would like a return to the days when the most trusted man in America was a communist and the “news” media regularly blew smoke, rainbows and unicorns up the people’s backsides.Yeah, Barry, those days are over.“That is hard to do, but I think it’s going to be necessary, it’s going to be possible,” he added.“The answer is obviously not censorship, but it’s creating places where people can say ‘this is reliable’ and I’m still able to argue safely about facts and what we should do about it.”Considering that all sides will present their cases in the best light, what is truth in the realm of politics can be subjective.  Until it becomes iron-clad objective, only communicating what you want the people know is called censorship.  Last time any of us in the USA looked at the law of the land, from the government, unless national security is involved, that is illegal.BTW, Google launched a new feature today: Fact Check.  It’s probably as reliable as the search algorithms that never seem to give conservative sites and opinions on the first three pages.',fake
'Back when Obama was campaigning for what would be the first half of the national destruction “transformation” nightmare, he was asked by a supporter in Ohio, “I would just like to know what you can say to reassure us that this election will not be rigged or stolen.”Obama goes on to comfort the woman, assuring her, though she may not have realized it at the time, that it would in fact be stolen and that he would be the thief. After all, she asked to be reassured, she didn’t say it had to involve honesty or integrity. She’s a Democrat; those things don’t matter much.Obama pointed out that “It helps in Ohio that we’ve got Democrats in charge of the machines. He goes on to tell the group that he’s from Chicago so he has experience with “monkeying around” with elections, although he dismisses that possibility these days as silly nonsense, claiming not to even know what that means. He notes that, as is presently the case today, “Whenever people are in power, they have this tendency to try to tilt things in their direction.”He naturally, went on to recommend a federal boot on the necks of the citizenry, a “federal voting rights division,” to guarantee  that the laws would be enforced uniformly and fairly. It would follow the same conceptual lines as the way DHS has sealed our borders with uniform enforcement of immigration laws or the way the Holder and Lynch at the DOJ or Comey at the FBI have been above reproach in prosecuting all offenders, even former Secretaries of State equally. The kind of system like that in place at the State Department where Muslim “refugees” are imported almost exclusively over Christians despite being the ones facing the greatest threat.That’s the kind of “objective fidelity” to the concepts and principles upon which this nation was founded that Obama was in favor of at the time. He spoke in support of a paper trail for voting machines back then, but now, eight years later, his boss George Soros controls one third of America’s voting machines and there is less reliance on paper ballots than when Obama became the first non-American pretend ‘president.’Obama said they would be serious about investigating “vote fraud,” which obviously hasn’t been the case or they’d have Debbie Wasserman Schultz, most of the DNC, Hillary Clinton and the guy making the speech wearing ankle bracelets or behind bars. Violent DNC goon Bob Creamer wouldn’t have made 340 visits to the White House and top Democrats wouldn’t have incited violence against Trump supporters. They are only serious about winning regardless of what it takes, about clinging to power that they will never relinquish, and about keeping their activities hidden from view.Americans need to be vigilant. He’s the same “big, powerful government is the answer for everything” guy that he warned these people about eight years ago; the one with those tilting tendencies. ',fake
'Those Americans who thought that Hussein Obama had given up drugs might now want to rethink those views, based upon his latest claims. Pretend ‘president’ Obama claimed there had been no “major scandal” in his administration during a Democratic fundraiser Sunday night in San Diego. It’s an unbelievable comment the first foreign dictator of the United States made while engaged in a rant against Republican Rep Darrell Issa, the former Chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Issa at one time had referred to Obama as “one of the most corrupt presidents” in modern history, although he’s not really a president, having never met the eligibility requirements. The most corrupt person to ever pretend to be ‘president’ or to prop his feet up on a desk in the Oval Office would be more correct.Obama said of Issa, “Here’s a guy who called my administration perhaps the most corrupt in history–despite the fact that actually we have not had a major scandal in my administration–that, when Trump was suggesting that I wasn’t even born here, said, well, I don’t know, was not sure. This guy has spent all his time simply trying to obstruct, to feed the same sentiments that resulted in Donald Trump becoming their nominee.” Whatever, Obama, none of that rant made any sense, but as an antidote to your corruption and that of the DC system of illegitimate government, we’re fortunate to have Mr. Trump in that capacity. We just need to make sure he wins.In making his laughable claims, Obama must be counting on the American people and his audience to have the memory of a fly drawn to stench of his oration. The list of Obama scandals is long and varied. It includes his fictional autobiography,  forged birth certificate,  use of a previously issued fraudulent Social Security number, forged draft registration, Chicago Climate Exchange, Fast and Furious gun running, Benghazi terrorist arms running and the deaths of four Americans, the destruction of Libya, complicity with the Muslim Brotherhood, both inside the US federal government and in the overthrow of Mubarek in Egypt.There’s Solyndra, climate hoax, federalization by decree of huge tracts of land, UN sustainable development agenda 2030, gun control, Domestic surveillance, Incompetence, Lies about unemployment numbers and job creation, Obamacare lies, bankrupting of coal, EPA takeover of our economy, UN globalization, servitude to George Soros, anti-American posture at the border, facilitated invasion from Mexico, facilitated invasion from Central America, facilitated invasion from Middle East, importation of unvetted terrorists as “refugees.”Obama doesn’t mention his curious connection to Frank Marshall Davis being possibly his father, his mother working for Timothy Geithner’s father at the Ford Foundation, being raised a Muslim, promoting Islam, Intentionally weakening the American economy, death of Loretta Fuddy in plane crash, intentional destruction of America’s armed forces, end of don’t ask don’t tell, transgender service personnel, women in combat, giving away of the Internet to his globalist comrades.He created a political weapon of the IRS, Lois Lerner’s Fifth Amendment, Eric Holder’s contempt of Congress, IRS destruction of evidence, Ferguson and elsewhere race war instigating, war on cops, takeover of local law enforcement by feds, Bureau of Land Management as a criminal enterprise, sale of uranium to Russia, TPP, Payment of coyote fees from US Treasury for Central American invaders, classification of most illegals as asylum seekers, sanctuary cities, ending of repatriation of illegals, ambush and murder of LaVoy Finicum, importation of Islamists, interfering in Brexit, interfering in the Israeli elections, removing of Islamic references from federal training and other terrorist documents, VA hospitals, illegal alien amnesty, rule by dictatorship, ignoring and nullifying federal law by memorandum issues by his henchman Jeh Johnson and many others.Whatever he’s smoking, it’s some pretty potent stuff. It must be coming across that open border he has created and Hillary Clinton plans on expanding along with her continuation of the population dilution, part of his racist attack on white Americans. There’s the drug addiction epidemic scandal and the heroin epidemic as well as the murder rate in Chicago and Black Lives Matter racist agitations. There’s also the Hitler-style use of thugs to tilt the upcoming elections in partnership in conjunction with the DNC and Hillary Clinton. The State Dept lack of security, Clinton’s home server, Iran deal, John Kerry and the rest of federal government covering up for Hillary Clinton are also noteworthy.There is no shortage of items in his list of scandals that he’s pretending not to be aware of or hoping we’d forgotten about. The truth has no place in a sentence spoken by Hussein Obama and it is rarely, if ever, found there.',fake
'Back in early August Hussein Obama was asked by one of his adoring trained seals during a press conference about assertions made by Donald Trump that the election was be rigged against him. Obama was asked, “Can you promise the American people that this election will be conducted in a fair way and are you worried that comments like his could erode the public’s faith in the outcome of the election. And if he does win, given that you’ve just declared him unfit, what will you say to the American people?”The great deceiver, who was already vigorously engaged at that time in election fraud, as was exposed by the Project Veritas videos,  replied that he has one vote. That may be true but he has the power to enable many others who “have one vote” to vote multiple times through his fraud and those who have no right to vote to vote anyway, as many times as they are able to get away with. As illegal aliens, most laws, including those regarding ID fraud, are not enforced against them.Obama then attempts to portray Mr. Trump’s concerns as petty and impossible, saying “I don’t really know where to start on answering this question.” Most folks would start with the truth, but not Obama. His lips would catch fire.He then puts on his condescending “cute little smirky boy face” and says, “Of course the elections will not be rigged. What does that mean?” He says the federal government doesn’t run the election process, which is true, although Jeh Johnson and other criminals at DHS are trying hard to insert themselves.Nobody, and that includes Mr. Trump, said it would be the federal government rigging the system. The Democrats, globalists, and establishment GOP have those bases covered. After hiding behind the veil of local governments running the actual election processes, Obama dismissed Trump’s concerns, saying, “That’s ridiculous, that doesn’t make any sense and I don’t think anybody would take that seriously.”The liar in the White House goes on to say, “Now we do take seriously, as we always do, our responsibilities to monitor and preserve the integrity of the voting process. If we see signs that a voting machine or system is vulnerable to hacking, (it’s exploited) then we inform the local authorities that are running the elections that they need to be careful.” Why is Jihadi Jeh Johnson asking for permission to monitor the election if they’re already, according to Obama, doing that and informing the locals? Clearly that’s just a smoke screen for the next point, to appear involved on a broad basis and objective.What they do police obsessively, in the favor of the Democrats, is the next point he raises, access. Giving the impression that inspectors are walking around with clipboards conducting random and fair inspections, Obama said, “If we see jurisdictions that are violating federal laws (excluding immigration) in terms of equal access and uh aren’t providing ramps for disabled voters, or are discriminating in some fashion, or are otherwise violating civil rights laws, then the “Justice” Department will come in and take care of that.” They’ll invite the New Black Panthers to come in as monitors to make sure no Republicans or crackers do what the Dems are already up to.As usual Obama presents fabrication as fact. Local ordinances across the nation already require public buildings, the kind used for polling, to be wheel chair accessible. That problem doesn’t exist but state and local governments preventing illegal squatters from voting or limiting people to a single vote is something the Democrats take seriously.It was all foundation laying for a point in the future when the attempted theft was is no longer speculation but a reality. That’s why he chided Trump for being proactive in his complaints, to try to silence him through ridicule. Their plan might have worked if their corruption hadn’t been exposed by James O’Keefe and Project Veritas.Obama didn’t need to ask what election rigging means since he has been up to his eyeballs in it since he first propped his feet up on the people’s desk. He was engaged in it against Bernie Sanders in the primary and now with Hillary Clinton’s operatives, including George Soros’ Black Lives Matter thugs and their orchestrator, Bob Creamer, through 342 White House meetings. If anyone knows about election stealing, it’s the foreigner who isn’t even an American. He could and probably does, give lessons.Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'Obama has a history of acting against the interests of the United States and of being more than just a little too considerate of the demands of the Saudis and other Arab nations in matters of US policy. He’s facilitated the cancerous growth of Saudi-funded mosques inside the United States and the importation of their people into our nation as the seeds of what they see as their ordained future conquest of our country. They are emblematic of their disdain for and dedication to the destruction of our American culture and identity as a nation. His diversity mission is that destruction of who we are, our reconfiguration into who they are, part of the expansion of their global caliphate.The Russians are coming under fire for standing up to the same adventurism of the Obama Clinton regime that created hell out of a formerly orderly and prosperous Libya. The Obama regime is desperate to serve their Saudi masters in toppling Assad and creating yet another terrorist breeding ground. Obama and Congressional allies, such as John McCain, are waging a war on Assad using terrorists as their soldiers, arming the very people who would have a blade on our throats in the next instant.Russia is exposing a new administration plan to allow an army of raping ISIS terrorists to flee the city of Mosul in Iraq, complete with their terrorist family units. More than a simple retreat, it is a redeployment of forces, ISIS terrorists under the direction of Hussein Obama. They are to be allowed to escape and then moved to join the fight as Obama mercenaries against Syria. On one section of dirt they are the enemy, a few hundred miles to the West they’re Obama’s boys.As reported in The Sun, an agreement is said to exist that was brokered by the Saudis in which the US and coalition forces will bomb selected, predetermined targets in Mosul and avoid others, with the targeting based upon agreements reached with the ISIS terrorists in advance. It even includes the bombing of vacant buildings in order to provide the illusion of an actual, aggressive military action.The plan was revealed to The Star by a military source in Moscow which stated, “In preparation for the operation in Mosul, US intelligence agencies and Saudi Arabia agreed that before the assault all militants will be offered a safe route to leave the city with their families.”He continued, “And at the time of the assault, coalition aircraft would only strike empty buildings, agreed in advance with the militants. More than 9,000 ISIS fighters will be transferred to the eastern regions of Syria to follow a major offensive operation, which involves the capture of Deir ez-Zur and Palmyra.”While it may sound unbelievable that the US would allow safe passage for a terrorist army from Mosul to Syria, it should be remembered that that was exactly what the United States did as ISIS was on the march across Iraq when it first emerged as the “Islamic State.” Open convoys presented easy targets that could have been destroyed and all of this bloodshed, expense and destruction avoided.Instead Obama protected them then and there is no reason to believe he wouldn’t do the same thing again. The finger pointing goes both directions between Russia and the US but if past actions are any indicator, the Russians may be telling the truth. Especially now that the ISIS terrorists would be headed to Syria to do the bidding of Obama and the Saudis. The Obama thugs have been blaming every setback, every exposure, every military failure or atrocity on the Russians in what appears to be an effort to create a slippery slope into an actual hot war. It’s probably a good idea for them to reveal what Obama’s really up to; who he really works for and with. It’s no wonder he hasn’t been able to defeat ISIS. We now have more irrefutable proof of what we’ve long believed. They work for him.',fake
'Ok, we’ve got some oranges to compare to the road apples the left and GOP globalists have been throwing at our future next president, Mr. Trump. On one hand we’ve got two guys sitting on a bus engaged what they thought was a private conversation with no by standers involved, the Trump – Bush conversation.On the other hand, you’ve got Hussein Obama doing his best Bill Clinton imitation, getting sexually aroused over something and then exciting himself more by presenting having other people look at him, presenting himself, as they call it in National Geographic videos, for the viewing “pleasure” of a plane load of reporters.As the video starts out, Obama stands, pretending to be unaware of his erection. That’s not the kind of thing that happens in a vacuum (unless he’s sent in his $19.95 plus shipping) or more correctly, without the knowledge of the individual involved. But Obama’s just getting started. Rather than remaining seated until the situation corrected itself, Reggie’s stud muffin decided to make sure everyone on the plane got a good look.He first stood up in the face of one female, who immediately turned around with a sheepish look on her face and walked to the back of the plane. Obama then posed for a few moments before doing a couple of “Victoria’s Secret” style spins for his captive audience. Some of the women can be heard telling one of their fellow reporters to sit down as she was blocking their view of the exhibitionist.After a catwalk spin in each direction, Obama raised his leg up, propping it upon a seat across the aisle, allowing for a full and unobstructed view of his package. It’s a display not unlike that we’ve seen from the Mooch when the choice of attire was a little too tight and a little too revealing around the groin area.As it becomes obvious to Obama that he’s making a spectacle of himself, that everybody in the plane knows what he’s doing and looking at him, some decency appears to creep in from somewhere. He’s at least self-conscious enough to move back to a less obvious position from which to generate his perverse Democrat brand of political excitement.As his little show wraps up, Obama looks back at the group for his finale, making eye contact as if he is asking if it was as good for them as it was for him. For most it was probably their first experience with this Obama prick; and unfortunately not their last.Why is it again that the MSM propagandists are so upset about two guys talking in private, out of sight, in their seats on a bus?',fake
'Barack Hussein Obama has a brother who is three years older than him.  His name is Malik Obama and he is Obama’s half brother. Malik Obama holds different opinions about America than Barack does.  That’s why he’s speaking out.Donald Trump invited Malik to attend the 3rd and final debate in support of him. Malik was thrilled and accepted the invite.  He said,“I’m excited to be at the debate. Trump can make America great again!”Malik — an American citizen who lives in Washington, DC, when he’s not in Kenya blasted Clinton’s performance as secretary of state for exacerbating the chaos and violence in the Mideast. Malik said ousted Libyan leader Moammar Khadafy had been a good friend. “Check out the situation in Libya now,” he said.In Kogelo, Kenya, Malik dedicated and named the Barack H. Obama Foundation to help the poor village their family is from. It’s in honor of his and the Presidents father. Needless to say, President Obama never mentions this foundation but has plenty good things to say about the Clinton Foundation! Malik said,“If I had gotten the support I should have gotten from my brother we would of been better able to help the families village.”Malik last saw his brother Barack in August of 2015 when he visited Kenya.  The relationship between the two brothers seems distant.  He stated, “I went to the White House to say hello. I paid a courtesy call but it wasn’t a very warm and loving reception. As usual, it was a hands-off kind of thing, very businesslike, very formal.”Malik agrees the mainstream media is biased and he doesn’t believe the women who claimed Trump groped them. “I don’t believe them,” Malik said. “Why didn’t they come forward before?”Donald Trump told the press, “I look very much forward to meeting and being with Malik. He gets it far better than his brother.”',fake
'The Un – “Affordable Care Act,” Obamacare, was signed into law in March of 2010. Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid and Hussein Obama forced the piece of bankruptcy-bound legislation, which was designed to fail, upon the American people against our will as a health welfare program.Democrats also loved it because it would destroy our private medical sector while inflicting a huge amount of red ink upon the United States through subsidies and bailouts. It has done just what anyone with half a brain, the Democrat leadership, either never saw coming or never cared was coming. It’s what thinking people in opposition knew was inevitable from the outset.Hussein Obama can’t claim he didn’t know it would end like this, he was intimately involved. He had an MIT economics expert, Jonathan Gruber telling him to just go out and screw the stupid people. Anyone who believes Obama is undeniably stupid, but this is a new group of them, the current millennials.  We all must know Obamacare is somehow failing in some yet undisclosed manner because of George Bush. Mr. Big Boy Obama will most certainly blame him as soon as someone comes up remotely sellable reason. For now the guy who’s always telling Donald Trump he shouldn’t be whining about Democrat racketeering and election fraud is whining about exactly what he was warned about with Obamacare.His “Guru” Jonathan Gruber was demonized for being honest enough in an academic setting to admit that Obamacare was a fraud, deliberately structured, “written in a tortured way to make sure that CBO did not score the mandate as taxes. If CBO scored the mandate as taxes the bill dies.” He also noted that if you wrote it honestly as healthy people pay in sick people get money it wouldn’t have passed. That testimony, on video from November of 2014, shows the intent to deceive and to have the millenials that Obama is speaking to pay for other people’s coverage and expenses. It was the critical component of the doomed legislation from the outset.But to hear Hussein Obama tell it, the fault belongs either with George Bush or with the governors and legislatures of states which are “hostile” to the act. It’s them, not the exorbitant cost, limited coverage, huge deductibles or limited providers that are not the doctors he told people they could keep that are to blame for its insolvency and impeding collapse. Once again, socialism proves to be a abject failure.It’s all due, Obama tells us, to the states “not actively participating in outreach.” In other words, the honesty of those people who aren’t repeating the lies in the Ponzi scheme, who are exposing another of Obama’s many frauds, are to blame. Outreach for Obama is synonymous with BS or propaganda. Something at which he’s quite adept.Every excuse he’s using now was known in advance, as Gruber indicated. Particularly in this economy with real unemployment at around 30\%, young people aren’t going to be spending money on health insurance. Any idiot, even a Democrat pretend ‘president,’ could see this coming a mile away.Here’s Gruber explaining how the lies, fraud and the stupidity of young Americans are critical to Obamacare’s success.',fake

'This morning, an Artist erected an obscene caricature.   It was a naked statue of the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton in NYC.  He created her wearing an open robe which displays her breasts and she has goat hooves for feet. Not only does her nudity disgust anyone who looks at it but he made her breasts that’s bearing a figure of a man who appears on her left side. The man, which is to be perceived as a Wall Street Banker, is fondling her stomach and making a kiss face.The statue is reminiscent of a similar nude statue of Donald Trumperected in Union Square park in Manhattan in August, entitled “The Emperor Has No Balls”Crowds gathered around the statue quickly and some people were laughing while others reacted furiously.  A woman who identified herself as Nancy, was one of the most  angry attackers.  She expressed her outrage with it by toppling it over. “This is obscene” she said. The artist tried to stand the sculpture back up, but onlookers prevented him from doing so in video. Nancy is an employee at the nearby National Museum of the American Indian shouted. She told the New York Daily News: “To put something up like this in front of my workplace – I shouldn’t have to see this!”The Artists name is Anthony Scioli, 27,the Daily News reported. He was ordered by counter terrorism police posted nearby to remove the sculpture because he lacked the proper permitting to stage such a demonstration.Morning commuters who were witness to the scuffle over the art argued over its merits and to take it down was a violation of our First Amendment.  One guy said,“This lady shows up and tips it over and starts assaulting anyone who tried to put it back up!,” and another witness, Gene H. 39, said. He told reporters that the statue should stay up, citing freedom of speech laws.The statue reportedly went up before 6 am; it was gone by 8.30 am. ',fake
'The mainstream media guessed wrong again.  When they jumped on board the Clinton camp induced “bimbo eruptions” as outlined and described in some one of the Wikileaks email dumps – most likely to cover for the Wikileaks email dumps of John Podesta’s gmail account – the fifth column of the fourth estate made a really bad leap of faith.  See, they didn’t anticipate that no one would care about the bimbo eruptions.  Contrary to past election cycles, the viewers and audience are more interested in the Wikileaks dumps, and Paul Joseph Watson of Prison Planet generated a graph of internet searches from the last week that demonstrates that.From Drudge: The graph illustrates how even on the day the infamous ‘Trump tape’ was released, Google searches for Wikileaks were still significantly higher.Oops.  Guess bimbo eruptions are passe.  Either that, or the people have seen enough of Donald Trump that they don’t believe decades old allegations that really don’t match almost every account of the man’s behavior. (An old childhood neighbor met Trump on his plane last month and said he could not have been more gracious.)All this goes to show is that the mainstream media is living in the past.  They haven’t caught up to the reality that We the People have moved on from the old ways of doing things.  When it comes to the bimbo eruption aspect of politics, there’s a certain amount of crying wolf that melds with personality and aura that makes such allegations believable or not.  Guys like Bill Clinton, Ted Cruz, and some of the others just ooze something that makes bimbos in the background believable.  Trump…despite the model wives, not so much.We the People are more interested in email dumps.  Yes, they are BOR-RING to wade through, and there’s all sorts of junk there, but we’re finding out some really unsavory things about the people who run the country.  That’s far more important than gropings that most likely never happened.',fake
'New Delhi: Local chapter of OSLA (One Sided Lovers Association) is not happy with the practice of women changing their surnames after marriage and has asked center government to introduce a ban on the same. As per OSLA, it becomes very difficult to stalk the profiles of their crushes once they get married due to this practice.“As it is, it is hard to find the profiles of our crushes. Everyone in India is named Puja, Neha or Sonia, even with their maiden last name, 100s of results appear. However, since we know their maiden last names in most cases, we manage to find out their profile. However, once they get married, gone, it becomes so difficult to find the profile after that”, General Secretary of OSLA told Faking News.“Worst are these hyphenated last names that are becoming so popular. They are an absolute nightmare and we hope the government bans them at least. We are trying to rally support from feminists as well and trying to start a new practice where men change their last names. Who has to search for a male profile anyway”, the General Secretary added.When we asked him why don’t they just stop searching for girls who have obviously moved on in life, he said, “Bhai tum aashiq nahin ho na. They have moved on but we are standing right there na. It isn’t always about moving on either; sometimes we look up their profiles to check whether they have become ugly or something so that we can feel good that we avoided ending up with her. You won’t understand, tum aashiq lagte hi nahi ho.”OSLA has also asked Facebook to improve their search and add a feature where you can search with someone’s previous profile name.',fake
'New York: On a visit to the US, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan yesterday said that the American festival of Halloween is much less scary than Madhya Pradesh’s very own Vyapam. This is not the first time that CM Chouhan has praised MP during this visit to the US, earlier he had claimed that MP roads are better than the ones he came across in Washington.Halloween is around the corner and preparations are going on in the US ahead of this festival. CM Chouhan has shared some of the images on his Twitter account as well.Speaking at a public event, CM Chouhan said ,”I have seen the preparations for Halloween and I have been really impressed. However, I saw all the scary costumes around and heard a few scary stories from the locals but I wasn’t scared at all since I am from Madhya Pradesh. We have Vyapam there which is much scarier than anything that I have come across during this visit.”“Halloween is celebrated once an year while our Vyapam is being celebrated throughout the year for more than a couple of decades now. That makes it even scarier because you can never relax, you are always wary, it is a never-ending game”, he further added.After looking at some of the pumpkins decorated for Halloween, CM Chouhan commented that Madhya Pradesh has lemons that size.',fake
'After many speculations about the release of the much-awaited Rajasthani folk from Padmavati—Ghoomar—the song was finally released on Wednesday, much to the delight of the fans.More than the filmmakers and people associated with the film, members of the Rajput Karni Sena had prepared themselves for the mega event. In an attempt to find mistakes in the song, the community ended up making it the most viewed song within an hour after its release. Immediately after the launch of the song, members of the community logged in to watch the song in order to find mistakes and stall the release of the film. In the process of doing so, the members watched it several times, which added to the total number of views on the song on YouTube. This did not just result in enormous traffic on YouTube but also helped the song break all records in terms of viewership. Sanjay Leela Bhansali, the director of Padmavati was ecstatic on seeing the increasing number of views, and said, “I have figured out the formula to make hit films. After making headlines throughout the shoot of Padmavati, I have decide that all my future films will be based on the Rajput community so that it remains in limelight.”Members of the Rajput Karni Sena, who could not find any errors in the song, were left red-faced after they realised that they made it the most-viewed song on YouTube within an hour after its release. Aggrieved, the members staged protests and vandalised public property in Mumbai to cause harm to Sanjay Leela Bhansali. “Bhansali has used us to get views on Ghoomar. Now, we’re offended again and we promise to not let his film release,” said an angry member of the Rajput Karni Sena, before torching a BEST bus to take revenge from Sanjay Leela Bhansali.',fake
'“Love stories are eternal,” as they say. They stay in our minds forever. Only the plot changes, characters remain the same. This is evident from the number of movies produced in last century on famous romantic pairs in human history- ‘Devdas-Paro‘ and Romeo and Juliet“.Inspired by the clever approach taken by his bête noire Anurag Kashyap, who changed the theme of Devdas’s love story from ‘love’ to ‘lust’ in Dev.D, India’s CBFC chairman Pahlaj Nihalani has decided to produce a highly-customized version of ‘Romeo and Juliet’ movie, taking inspiration from the recent events in modern India.Romeo is widely hailed as a romantic-tragic hero throughout the world, but considered a villain in India, thanks to persistent efforts to malign him by forming even a special force (Anti-Romeo Squad) in India’s most populous (and hence most love-making) state Uttar Pradesh.Pahalaj, whose transformation from a filmmaker of vulgar movies that contained double-meaning songs, to a Sanskari censorist puzzled many, has decided the story of Romeo must be retold considering India’s current societal realities.Teekhi Mirchi has learnt the new movie from Pahlaj Nihalani, to be tiled ‘Romeo Must Die’, has distorted the original Shakespeare epic masterpiece to a level, that would make the world rethink the way they look at love and romance.In the movie, The hero Romeo (Muslim by birth) meets a Hindi girl in Garba festival and falls in love with her. The activists of a right-wing group Hindu Yuva Vahini notice them chatting and point out that Non-Hindus are banned in Garba. The hero Romeo is beaten black and blue by the HYV, and handed over to Police.This prompts a widespread uproar on social media, especially by the liberal brigade, forcing the government to pass an ordinance in Assembly that men can’t talk to women in public, failing which they’ll be held responsible for whatever happens to them next.The government also decides to form a special commando force named after the boy – “Anti-Romeo Squad” to give a stern message to general public that anybody who dares to defy the order would meet the same fate of Romeo.The Anti-Romeo Squad puts Romeo in Jail, but the HYV insists on hanging Romeo for daring to trap a Hindu girl, or in other words perpetrating the crime of ‘Love Jehad’.',fake
'After a series of flip-flops - denying, inadvertently admitting and then again denying the Indian army’s surgical strikes in the PoK area – Pakistan has finally come out with a statement that a surgical strike was indeed conducted – not by the Indian army, but by aliens.“We would like to inform the world and those concerned that there was indeed a surgical strike that killed all our terrorists soldiers. But, contrary to what the Indian media has reported, this wasn’t done by the Indian army. It was done by aliens from God knows where – we have concrete evidence for it. Copies of a book named ‘UnReal Aliens’ written by some guy called Karthik Laxman were found in these terror camps. The book hasn’t been released yet and we’ve already banned it in Pakistan, just like we’ve blocked The UnReal Times itself, in many parts of the country. Don’t tell me the Indian army was reading those! So who else, but the aliens themselves could’ve left the books behind over here, as some sort of post-killing calling card?” read a statement from Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif.“Nevertheless, this won’t go unpunished. Aliens, don’t mistake our peaceful intent for weakness. If you’re planning to come again, let me tell you – Pakistan is ready and you will be wiped off the face of the solar system if you dare to come here!” the statement added.Sharif also shot off a letter to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, urging the multilateral body to expand beyond the planet and transition into a new body titled ‘United Planets’. While the US is yet to comment on Sharif’s claim, American satirical website The Onion has categorically denied any involvement in drafting the statement.Journalists across the border, have, however stated that India should stand by Pakistan until Sharif’s statement has been proven to be false. “Sure, laugh all you want, call me anti-national. But if aliens are indeed not responsible for the attack that Sharif claims they did, then why aren’t they denying it? What’s stopping them from doing so? As a responsible neighbour, we ought to be lending our support at this precarious time,” tweeted controversial journalist Barkha Dutt of NDTV.India Today’s controversial journalist Rajdeep Sardesai too, echoed a similar view. “We’ve heard Nawaz Sharif’s side of the story now. Let’s not jump to conclusions until we hear the alien side too. That is good, responsible journalism, not jingoistic mockery which some irresponsible Indian news channels stoke. I’m always open to asking aliens some good questions if they want to come out with their response,” Sardesai told Pakistan’s Geo News.While the Indian government is yet to respond to Sharif’s claim, PM Modi tweeted that ALIENS meant ‘A Laughter Indulgence Everyday is Never Sinful’.The last shot, as always, came from AAP spokesperson, The Ashutosh, who tore into the PM, demanding a response. “Why the alliance attacked the Nawaj Shareef and the Pakistan !!! Will the Modi answer !” the former IBN7 journalist tweeted.',fake
'Global terror hub Pakistan has called for a nationwide shutdown on the 9th of November, in what it terms a strong protest against the Indian Ministry of Information & Broadcasting’s 1-day ban on satire news channel NDTV.Pakistan Prime Minister Raheel Nawaz Sharif, after firing a stinging letter to UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon, highlighting India’s 24-hour ban on NDTV, which he termed a cold-blooded murder of democracy and free speech, officially made the announcement. “The people of Pakistan stand shoulder to shoulder in solidarity with the employees of NDTV at this time. To make the world get an idea of what is happening in India as well as about how much dear NDTV means to us, the whole of Pakistan will shut down on the 9th of November. This will teach India a lesson,” Sharif stated. If rumours are to be believed, ORF chief Sudheendra Kulkarni and Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar are expected to join the agitation across the border.Sharif’s appeal found resonance not only among Pakistan’s citizens, but also among their terrorists. Leading the charge was JuD chief terrorist Hafiz Saeed, who announced a worldwide terror shutdown on the 9th. “Who does India think they are? After I mentioned that I am a big fan of Barkha Dutt, they go all coward and block her channel for 24 hours! I won’t take this insult to our Barkha lightly. I appeal to all my fellow terrorists in Pakistan and in all parts of the world, including the ones in India, to suspend all terror operations on that day to show our solidarity. This way, we will send out a strong message,” Saeed announced.The clarion call has been uniting all rival factions in Pakistan by the hour. While PTI chief and former cricketer Imran Khan announced that he would not look to marry anyone on the 9th of November, in complete solidarity with NDTV, former Pakistan External Affairs Minister Hina Rabbani Khar has announced that she would not be purchasing any Birkin bags on that day.The countries standing up for NDTV do not seem to be limited to Pakistan alone. According to NDTV’s Sreenivasan Jain, the Gaza administration has conveyed similar intentions to him. “I’m in Gaza right now and every citizen here, right from the safed dhaadis to the kaala dhaadis feel that this is no chota-mota matter. NDTV and I personally mean so much to these people. Even today, whenever people see me on the streets here, they laud my coverage of Snoopgate,” Jain told The UnReal Times.While a few journalists at NDTV are still shell-shocked and clueless over what to do during the day, journalist Sunetra Choudhury has signed up for an alternative reading class at JNU. NDTV India’s Ravish Kumar declared that he would cover himself up with the black screen he previously used, for the whole day, in protest against the government’s move. While Union I&B Minister Venkaiah Naidu is yet to comment on the issue, his predecessor Arun Jaitley is likely to go on leave on November 9th, according to Finance Ministry sources.',fake
'Pakistan has decided to take the battle to India. The terrorist state is making long term investments into education that will help them trump India as an IT superpower. Speaking to us, Lieutenant General Asim Bajwa said that the Pakistan military is very upset with Indian PM Modi’s speech saying that while India exports software, Pakistan exports terrorism. Maybe the Indian PM does not know that creating and exporting terrorism needs as much planning and education as software needs.“We have compared the successes of our terror and your software. While Indians just work on Wall street, it was a Pakistani who created the blue print for 9/11. Indian may head Google, but a Pakistani created the first virus (and these two are not very different!) We find that our lacunae is in not branding our terror curriculum like India has done with the IITs. Henceforth, we are cleaning up and starting with JEE, IIT, and IIM.A lot of students study in Madarasas. Some of them go on to do spiritual stuff but most don’t. We will have a JEE or ‘Jihadi Entrance Exam’ for these students. Based on the JEE scores, students will qualify for Islamic Institutes of Terrorism (IITs). We know that India had started IITs with foreign collaboration. We have our own gurus. We will have 3 IITs to begin withAll three IITs will offer an unique structured curriculum on radical Islam, infiltration, bombing and suicide vest preparation. Campus placements are assured. All of them will do an internship with ISI. Subsequently, they will have 3 levels of placement.Some of them may not want to be operatives but do strategic work generating militancy. We are creating the Islamic Institute of Militancy, which will be symbolically located at Abbottabad. This will be our IIM A.We will also have a Khan Academy, named after AQ Khan, who will focus on stealing nuclear blueprints from across the world. We also hear that India has IIITs, Indian Institute of Information Technology. We will also have one IIIT – Islamic Institute of Infiltration & Terrorism.”“But sir, more people are also learning from Coursera these days in India,” said our correspondent.“We are going digital too! It was a shame that there were terror attacks in Bangladesh that was triggered by the preachings of an Indian. So, we are creating a platform to share all the curriculum from people like Zakir Naik to all ISIS terror material, morphed videos etc. All such material will be available here. This will enhance our reach,” he said.“Also, we have seen that there are many stone throwers in Kashmir. How do we train them? So, we are making videos of Pakistani bowlers like Shoaib Akhtar, Shabbir Ahmed, Saeed Ajmal who had been banned by ICC for throwing. Now, the stone throwers can tease with bouncers, slower ones and doosras! Who says we are a backward country? All Fatwas and hitlists will be shared on our digital platform as end of course assignments. This will be called Poursera.”“How do you whip up enthusiasm?” asked our correspondent.“That is easy. We are going to be doing TED talks across the country. Don’t think this is that TED. Our TED is Terrorism, Extremism, Destruction. Using very short speeches and demos, we will ensure enough people take the JEE.”“But why now, sir?”“You know General Raheel Sharief is retiring next month. He would like to leave a permanent and enduring legacy and nothing can be better than this.”“But how does the world react?”“Don’t worry. We have already shared the subject with channels like NDTV. Soon you will see a campaign from India itself saying let’s help the Pakistani IITs. Peaceniks will share a picture of an IIT student in India and Pakistan each and say let peace prevail! Communication is the least of our worries.”“All this is fine, sir. But how will these make an IT superpower?”“Arrey bhai! Who says IT is Information Technology? For us, IT is Islamic Terrorism!”',fake
'Islamabad: In a twisted set of events, Pakistan has decided to shut down its Tourism Ministry. According to our sources in Islamabad, it will now rely on Bhakts to send people from India regularly to Pakistan, to aid its ailing tourism. It directly accounts for expenditure cuts, and the amount saved has been redirected to Charity foundations run by renowned philanthropists Maulana Masood Azhar and Hafiz Saeed.This sounds strange, but in the last one year, Bhakts from India have found a job under ‘PM Pakistan Bhejo Yojna’ in order to find tourists for Pakistan.Pakistan is easier country to reside, owing to its proven Visa liberties, which was highlighted when Osama was found living there without a Visa for a record 10 years.A year back when Shahrukh was first sent to Pakistan, a lot of his fans reached there to see him, just like they flooded Mannat every year on his birthday. When Aamir left India, similar thing happened. Then Karan Johar reached Pakistan, and he immediately started making movies. His first movie in Pakistan garnered critical acclaim, and was titled- “I am a Hindu and I am not a Kaafir”, though Pakistan did not allow him to release the movie, as it questions secular and peaceful credentials of their respected nation.Soon Salman followed, and their film industry in distress has recovered a bit. Some lesser known names which were sent there started acting in their TV serials, and they are ‘reaching’ India through Subhash Chandra owned Zindagi Channel. Subhash Chandra is the same person who runs National Deshbhakt news channel ‘Chhi News’. People are still waiting for KRK, Tushaar, Rakhi Sawant, Sambhavna, Owaisi, Yogi etc to support Pakistan, so that they can actually send some more people over to Pakistan, and get a sigh a relief from regular bullshit on TV and social media.Jai Hind.

'M S Dhoni; the untold story, a movie based on Indian skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni, has come under heavy criticism from Pakistan. In a joint statement released on Friday evening, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Pakistan Army have categorically declared that the part of the movie where India beats Pakistan in 2007 T20 World Cup is a brazen attempt to defame the nation through misinformation.Although the movie hasn’t been released in Pakistan, a team of Pakistani army personnel along with Mr. Sharif have reportedly watched the movie at an Indian theater in disguise, and they are clearly not amused at the portrayal of their national cricketers as a bunch of underperforming and confused individuals, wandering on the ground not knowing what to do.Mr. Sharif has sought the help of Pakistani filmmakers to give India a befitting reply, and urged them to produce a movie where Pakistan wins every match against India.Sources revealed that the script has already been written and the movie is all set to go into production next month.The movie is set in 2019 in Abu Dhabi, the only place where Pakistan is allowed to host a cricket match a city that has the best cricket stadium in the world where Pakistan beats India in the World Cup final to lift the trophy. Here’s an excerpt from the script:An invincible Pakistan team beats England, Australia, and South Africa to reach the final, and now they face their arch rival India. A young Afridi comes out of retirement only to play the final match.India posts a total of 220 in 20 overs and now it’s the turn of Pakistani batsmen to show the skills they are known for.Cheater cocks that they are, Indian players try all sorts of unethical practices to break the concentration of Pakistani batsmen, including pushing them while they take strike, pulling their hair, and singing Taher Shah’s ‘Angel’ in their ears, but in vain. A resolute Pakistani team thwarts their nefarious tactics in a dignified manner and continues to chase the total.Umar Akmal scores a quick fire 70 and is ably supported by Shoaib Malik (Sania Mirza’s husband) who scores 50 runs in 15 balls, a strike rate he hitherto achieved only in book cricket. But the person who steals the show is Shahid Afridi, who bats for the large part of the 10-minute climax, a little longer than the total time he’d spent at the crease in a career spanning over 20 years.Pakistan needs 20 runs of 6 balls. A Joginder Sharma lookalike comes to ball the last over. Afridi plays a beautiful cover drive off the first ball and the ball races to the fence. He hits the next one over mid on for a six.“How do we stop them?” Dhoni anxiously asks Kohli.“We cannot. They are invincible,” says Kohli with a shrug of resignation.However, Afridi could only score four runs off the next three balls as Joginder Sharma deliberately bowls way outside the crease and the umpire cheats and doesn’t call them wides.Six runs needed off the last ball and Dhoni runs to Joginder Sharma and whispers something into his ears; he doesn’t look that cool anymore. Joginder Sharma tries to bowl underarm this time but God has had enough by then.Gusty winds blow across the crease and the balls rises above Afridi’s knee level, who hits it easily for a six and Pakistan wins the World Cup. Hence proved!Dejected Indian players leave the field while Pakistan team lifts the trophy amid thunderous applause.The movie will be tax free in Pakistan, the only country where it is likely to be released. However, Mr. Sharif is planning to show the movie at UN to expose India’s blatant lies.',fake

Infiltration activities are on a rise and Indian patience will soon run out.Pakistanis on one hand are already reeling under poor economic condition, and a war like situation would be bad for them too. PM Modi and Rajnath Singh are in continuous touch with the Army chiefs to explore options.

Pakistani students actually want Modi to attack Pakistan before their examinations so that the exams are cancelled and they don’t have to worry about putting hard efforts in study.

'Lahore: Recently we heard a black day was carried out in Pakistan on the auspicious occasion of killing of ‘martyr’ Burhan Wani. We sent our team of dedicated reporters to the world’s best country (believe us for the sake of first two lines of this report) Pakistan. Our research in Pakistan threw up these startling revelations.Teekhi Mirchi is the only source of good journalism prevailing in current times (Read the disclaimer). We are the ones who report from the ground zero. (Don’t compare us with Parkha. *name changed for the sake of nothing).Pakistan has been described by a great poet with these lines:Off late, with India’s stance on Kashmir getting stricter, there have been similar returns and inflated promises from Pakistan’s  side as well. When India killed one of the terrorists in Kashmir’s strike, the other day Pakistan declared black-day without being of aware of its consequences. We sent our daring and unpaid reporters (including this one) to Pakistan to know the ground reality of this Black-day.There was a bomb-blast across the road and people around were so habitual to it, that they were not even concerned of the smoke arising out of this bomb blast. It was so black that we decided to inquire with the local authorities if there was a black day that day as well. To our surprise, the authority office was shut down. The lock on the door was catching rust, signifying how many days have gone by without anyone willing to come here. We tried to capture all this on our camera but our batteries were discharged. Thankfully, some of their national heroes had placed a bomb and its remote at the authority warehouse, which guard at the building provided us.He also informed us that it stays like this throughout the year. Power supply would come for an hour or so. Off late, there have been enormous protests to improve the infrastructure, but then our great and Sharif leader told us that we will be cutting electricity for those one or two hours  in order to pay respect to Kashmiri leaders, who are dying in their fights with India. So, now we are powerless 24X7.When inquired whether they were aware of Burhan Wani before the killing, his blank face was enough to tell us that he still was unaware of this name.We asked him further if he has any request for Indian authorities. He told us, “Please stop killing Kashmiri leaders at all cost, otherwise we won’t be able to charge our mobiles. Our leaders are taking Blackdays dead seriously!”',fake
'Rep Paul Ryan, the guy who can’t bring himself to support Donald Trump because Trump isn’t conservative enough for Ryan’s taste, had some interesting comments on Friday when he visited the University of Wisconsin in Madison.Trump isn’t a true conservative in the eyes of weasel Ryan, though he has a strange definition of conservative. As he sees it, Trump is unacceptable because he doesn’t put the interests of big corporate fascists ahead of those of the American people, he doesn’t believe that anyone with a pulse should have the right to invade our nation, and he doesn’t believe the United States should be subservient to a world governing body, effectively giving up our national sovereignty. No, Ryan is right, Trump doesn’t support any of his perverse and distorted, “conservative principles.”But as it turns out, Ryan may be taking the plunge, coming out of the liberal closet. He may be ready to admit what many of us have known since before he became Speaker, during his times pushing TPP and open borders. The only things conservative about Ryan are the label he puts on himself and the extreme restraint he shows in the amount of enthusiasm he displays for our presidential candidate, Mr. Trump. He’s so conservative in that regard we’d almost think he wants Trump to lose.And that label of “conservative” may soon be shrugged off as well. When the weasel Ryan spoke to the gathering of UW-Madison’s College Republicans, his scheduled topic was to “lay out … exactly what liberal progressivism is and exactly how Hillary Clinton is going to double down on liberal progressivism.”It’s no secret to many that Ryan has much more in common with the establishment street walker Hillary Clinton than he does with the man of the American people, the patriot Donald Trump. He went beyond merely discussing what he sees as Clinton’s potential actions, he’s identifying with her in some ways, a puzzling course of action for the odd little man who is Speaker of the House, up for reelection in three weeks.First Shepard Smith made it official and then Paul Ryan took that first step in coming out as the closet fascist we know him to be. He declared himself to be a “classical liberal more than a conservative.” That’s progress, Ryan; while there’s nothing classical about you, the liberal point is undeniable. That’s the first thing we’ve agreed with you on in years. Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us..',fake
'Desperate to get media attention over the rising pollution levels in their areas, citizens in cities like Patna, Gwalior Allahabad and Raipur are spraying Fog deo all over in hope that someone will pay close attention to their woes as well.“We have been watching non-stop coverage of the unprecedented pollution levels in the national capital for a few weeks now. But what people don’t realize is that our cities are polluted too. Nobody talks about this because we don’t live in Delhi,” said a Patna citizen coughing but not giving up before completing the sentence.A person who regularly travels to Gwalior was not optimistic that spraying deodorant all over the city will get the media attention. But he saw a silver lining in the artificial cloud. “I hate visiting Gwalior because my in-laws stay there. But the Fog deo now sprayed all over gives the city a new odour and I like it. There you go, finally, a good reason for me to visit my wife’s city.”People of Allahabad too have been shocked as the ‘city of prime ministers’ has been neglected by the media when it comes to air pollution. “The only time our city and the state gets eyeballs is when there is infighting in the family of the party that rules us. When will the media realize that the pollution in UP too is going UP?”A dejected Raipur citizen said that one day he hopes his city too is placed on the pollution map of the country. “One day, I wish to see a special broadcast on prime-time news shows on the pollution levels in my city.”When asked what else was happening in the city apart from air contamination, the person replied, “Bas, Fog hi chal raha hai.

'New Delhi: After Yashwant Sinha’s strong criticism about the way current NDA government is handling India’s economy, many ministers have come forward ‘proactively’ to defend the government.While defending, the ministers use standard responses like how India is the fastest economy in the world. The problem India is facing today are the legacy problems from previous UPA government, three and half years is nothing but little more than 1200 days, not sufficient to reverse all the bad work of UPA. Surprisingly these standard responses didn’t get sufficient empathy for the government. Taking a view of that, some ministers have changed their tactics. Now they have started questioning the ‘niyat’ of the people who are criticizing the government.One such minister while talking to us he said, “The reaction is coming from people who are jobless. These are the same people who do not pay a single penny as income tax to the state exchequer for nation building. Taking advantage of the unlimited data plans some telecom providers have provided, these people’s only job is to criticize the government in social media.”We pointed to him that the same jobless people though do not pay income tax, they pay GST for most of the products they buy or the services they use, he told us, “So, what’s great they are doing. They are only doing their job as the law of the land demands”. On our query does law of the land prohibits such bad ‘niyat’ people to criticize the government, the Minister got agitated and stood up to leave the interview in the middle.Our reporter who was going to his hometown for Dussehra festival after paying a hefty price for a premium tatkal ticket, got a kick on his ass from railway TTE as he was sleeping after 6 AM. “Law of the land says you cannot sleep beyond 6 AM.

'According to all major news channels,Indian Finance Minister Arun Jaitley is to make a major announcement at 4 pm today. This has caused a great panic in the country with people starting guess work about what the announcement could be. Any major announcements in the last 2 years have resulted in people panicking and taking measures to lessen the impact on their lives. Be it GST, Demonetization or any new Cess added to the current taxes. The most bizarre story which Faking News got today is a man demanding dowry to be paid in 1 Rupee coins as he fears that Jaitley may demonetize higher denomination notes.The story is of Shwetank Srivastava, who has been always concerned about the financial decisions made by the current government. And like many old fashioned Indians, he is also a strong believer in the practice of dowry. So when his Son’s marriage proposal went as per plan, he took a lot of time in cracking up a good dowry deal with the girl’s parents. And today was the day he was to receive the full amount as agreed upon. But Arun Jaitley’s announcement which is scheduled for 4 PM today created havoc in the mind of Shwetank, who immediately called up the bride’s parents and asked them to pay the required amount in 1 Rupee coins. There is a strong fear in his mind that higher denomination notes may be banned and all money received from dowry can go down the drain.In fact after hearing about Shwetank’s story, many businessmen across the nation were seen approaching beggars, rag pickers, small shops to get their higher denomination notes converted to coins and may be lower denomination notes. Many employees have already taken half day leave as they have to some how get rid of the high denomination notes before 4 PM today.',fake
'Mumbai: Karen Kapoor, a well-known celebrity from Mumbai has made it a point to spend at least 5 quality minutes with his family members daily.“At the end, what we are because of our family.  How can we ignore them? For me, what is more important is to make sure these five minutes I am spending with my family are pure ‘quality’ time”, said Karen Kapoor who was getting ready to attend her fifth ‘quality’ party that night. When we asked what makes the time ‘quality time’ because still there are many people who are spending hours with their family members unnecessarily, she said, “There is no hard and fast rule. Just make sure when you are sending time with someone nothing else other than your mobile comes in between. Do whatever you usually do with your phone, but you must not ignore the person who is there with you”.Karen added, “In those five minutes you must click at least a dozen photos, some videos. Just by telling how are spending quality time with your near and dear ones won’t work now days. You need to show case to the world by uploading photos, videos through social media like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter etc.”When we asked Karen Kapoor how she is able to extract time considering work pressure you have and the compulsion to attend so many mandatory parties, she said “Time to nikalna padta hai. Yes, there are days I cannot spend even 5 minutes with my kids and husband, I stretch on other days and catch up with my long-term average goal of 5 minutes. I am writing a book on this topic, it should be out in the market soon”.Our 5 minutes of quality discussion got disturbed when Karen got a call. She was invited to talk on ‘Good Parenting tips’ as her uploaded photos and videos showed she is doing everything ‘right’ one can possibly do while bringing up your kid.',fake
'In a bizarre development, surgeons at Narayana Health City (NHC), the hospital that operated on Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal to cure his persistent cough, have reported that the part of his overly large tongue that was cut out during the surgery has grown all by itself and is now as big as the original.“Yes, it’s true,” said Dr. Swaminathan, a surgeon at NHC. “We kept it in a specimen-bottle in the patho-lab cupboard and forgot about it. But yesterday I heard some sounds coming from inside the cupboard and when I opened it I was shocked to see that the piece had grown to a full adult size on its own. And it was talking!”“But how can a tongue talk all by itself?” our correspondent asked incredulously.“That stumped me too,” Dr. Swaminathan replied, “I called the attending Neurosurgeon, Dr. Rahul Aandhi, to ask him how this was possible. He said that during the actual surgery on Arvind, they had discovered that his original tongue was not connected to his brain, and hence operated independently.”Dr. Swaminathan added that analysis of the periodic measurements of the Delhi’s CM tongue before the surgery had revealed another curious fact: Kejriwal’s tongue had slowly and steadily grown in size since 2011. “His mouth restricted its growth, but despite that it grew by more than a couple of centimetres. The bit of tongue that was cut out, however, has had no such constraints and has been growing uninhibitedly since the surgery. There’s no telling how big it will get,” the doctor added.Accordingly, doctors have placed the tongue in an air-tight metal container to restrict its growth. “It keeps throbbing and thrashing inside the container, talking endlessly,” said Dr. Swaminathan.“What is it saying?” our correspondent asked.“What else? It’s a clone of its parent DNA after all. It just keeps repeating one name – Modiji.”The UnReal Times reached out to AAP leader, The Ashutosh, for his take on the development. The former journalist blamed it all on Prime Minister Modi and his agent in Delhi, LG Jung and demanded that they release the aforementioned tongue immediately. “Why has the Jung locked up the Tung? Will the Modi answer?” he demanded.',fake
'The 2016 election just got even more weird.  Buried in the middle of the latest Wikileaks dump of John Podesta emails (from his gmail account, too) is this exchange:For some context, the word or words “wetworks” has a very specific meaning in slang.  From Wikipedia:Wetwork is a euphemism for murder or assassination, alluding to spilling blood. The expression “wet work”, as well as the similar “wet job“, “wet affair”, or “wet operation”, are all calques of the euphemism used by the KGB for such activities, mokroye delo (wet dealings).[1] These operations are reputed to have been handled at the KGB by Spetsbureau 13, colorfully known as the “Department of wet affairs”For those who are not long time political junkies, Steve Elmendorf, according to Jim Hoft of The Gateway Pundit, once worked for former congresscritter of the great State of Missouri Dick Gephardt, who was very powerful in Democratic politics when he was voted out of office.What makes this exchange hinky is that it happened on February 9.  The next death of anyone of consequence in American government was Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia at Cibolo Creek Ranch on February 12 or 13 under truly suspicious circumstances.  To make matters even more hinky, there is a vineyard adjacent to the complex where Scalia’s body was found.This coincidence could mean nothing or it could mean everything.  From the beginning, Scalia’s death didn’t sit right with a lot of conservatives.  He was not really sick, and no autopsy was done.  He was embalmed before any investigation happened.  He was also one of the few people who was in a position and WILLING to stop the progressive agenda.  Not only that, with Chelsea Clinton’s words that now that Scalia was gone, they could move on gun control not even three months later, the whole Scalia death episode is smelling more and more like the KGB wetworks definition.This little email exchange just adds to the intrigue.  Was Scalia assassinated?  Good question.Before my fellow conservatives go off half cocked about the other major conservative figure death of the year – Phyllis Schlafly – this writer has knowledge via close contacts and mutual friends that she died of cancer.  It was not unexpected to the family at all.  She had not been doing well for quite some time.',fake
'While wading through the John Podesta emails, this writer found one that indicated David Brock figured Hillary Clinton’s Republican opponent would be Donald Trump back in January.  Being the busy beavers that the Democrats are when it comes to digging up dirt on their opponents, John Podesta and company already had a 157-page document with loads and loads of information on Trump in addition to reports on Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, those they thought would be a danger to Hillary Clinton’s coronation since December 19, 2015.In that document are references to Donald Trump’s “mistreatment of women.”  From Fox News:In a section on Page 31 titled “Trump Has Devalued And Demeaned Women Repeatedly Throughout His Career,” Trump’s comments to “This Morning” in 1997 are transcribed under the heading “Trump On Miss Universe Pageant Winner.”“She weighed 118 pounds, or 117 pounds, and she went up to 160 or 170,” Trump said on “This Morning.” “So this is somebody that likes to eat.”Machado is not identified by her last name, and her first name is misspelled “Alisa.” The supposed “Miss Piggy” and “Miss Housekeeping” put-downs do not appear either. However, Trump’s printed comments on Machado in the document seemingly show the Clinton campaign began considering using the episode against the business mogul before the primaries even began.So, where Hillary Clinton found the “Miss Piggy” reference she spoke in September at the Hofstra Debate was not in that document, but the concept was one that the Democratic campaign planned to use from the start.Near the end of the showdown, during a sustained riff about the Republican nominee’s past remarks about women, Clinton cited the case of Miss Universe 1996 Alicia Machado.“And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest,” Clinton said. “He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them. And he called this woman ‘Miss Piggy.’ Then he called her ‘Miss Housekeeping,’ because she was Latina. Donald, she has a name.”As stated above, those monikers are not listed in the 1997 publicity.  All The Donald said about this woman was that apparently she liked to eat.  (That gets a lot of us girls in trouble, but we aren’t Miss Universe.)Dirt digging and planning attack strategies is what political campaigns do.  It’s all about the sales job to get the candidate elected.  That the campaign had documents and dirt almost a year ago proves that these professionals are good at their jobs…and that they knew they were going to have to go dirty in order to get their candidate elected.  In the case of Alicia Machado, her story, and the dirt attached to it, did not start to stick until the third debate and Hillary’s mention of it.Other topics of attack were found in the larger document:The Clinton campaign Trump file includes headers such as: “Reliance On Chinese Goods”; “Support From White Supremacists”; and “Trump University.” A subsection in a unit on immigration is titled “Conspiracy Theories.” Subsections on Trump’s personal life include notes on “Net Worth,” “Dodging Personal Bankruptcy” and “Comments on Fidelity and Pre-Nuptial Agreements.”Give the Hillary people credit.  They did their homework.  Too bad most of it didn’t happen the way it was spun and reported by the lapdog media.',fake

'It’s good that the mortal human being, Pope Frank, was only elected as the head of the Catholic Church, and therefore he’s only empowered to ruin the religion of a segment of the Christian population. Frank’s a big believer in unlimited migration, so he’ll surely understand when Catholics migrate to other Christian faiths in response to his movement of their Church towards the satanic influences of liberalism, globalization and his embrace of Islam.  On Thursday Bergoglio gave a speech to a group of 1,000 Lutherans at the Vatican in which he basically told them that they have no salvation without accepting his and George Soros’ invasion. In other words, he told them submit or you’re going to Hell. That’s a pretty heavy problem he’s dumping on the Catholics of the world, one that could so easily be avoided if his danged world conquest weren’t always getting in the way.Frank is a key part of the structure that has created the crisis situation. He’s one of the world government oligarchs who are importing a dependent population into Europe and America and then telling the local populations, “Here, you deal with it.” Having created a mess that is impossible to resolve, Frank is now running the ultimate guilt trip to get compliance. He has shifted church doctrine to where modeling one’s behavior after the socialists, Marxists, fascists and Muslim agitators Bergoglio, Soros, Merkel, Hollande and Obama is somehow now the path to Jesus.Turning your back on your nation, family, future, sovereignty, quality of life, national identity, culture, and security is the path of enlightenment. That is also the path to an Islamic takeover, so by complying with the hypocrite Bergoglio, one is simultaneously betraying and quickening the subordination of the Catholic Church to Islam. If he’s lucky, the rest of Christianity will follow.Pope Frankie knows a thing or two about hypocrisy, but doesn’t recognize his own. Naturally he preaches hypocritically about hypocrisy. That’s the Marxist in him.  It was a stretch for him to get there, but he’s the climate hoax, open borders, one world government pope; all of his proclamations stretch the limits of credibility past the breaking point. Bergoglio told his audience that Jesus abhors hypocrisy, and it is hypocritical to call oneself a Christian without welcoming refugees, even those who belong to a different religion.Frank’s laying down some of that white Pope smoke to hide his actions, but his message is still clear; accept the Muslim invasion, give up your space and your nations to them or you will be damned.He said hypocrisy is “the sin that Jesus condemns most. It is hypocritical to call oneself a Christian and send away a refugee, or one who needs my help. Jesus taught us who the good Christian is in the parable of the good Samaritan.” Hate to disagree with you, Pope, but the good Samaritan tended to a man who had been beaten and robbed, not someone who was coming to invade his nation. In today’s Europe, the very people that Francis is importing are the ones responsible for the highest percentage of crime. So he’s actually on the exact opposite side of the good Samaritan story from where he claims to be. Maybe that was another one of his breaking point stretches or perhaps it’s not in his Koran.Pushing the globalist Islamic worldwide caliphate, just as Hussein Obama does, at every gathering, seizing upon every opportunity, Pope Bergoglio said it was a “contradiction in those who want to defend Christianity in the West and on the other hand are against other religions and against refugees.” They’re not against the others you thick-headed liberal word-twisting snake, they have chosen their own faith and it is Christianity, not Islam. You have heard of Christianity, haven’t you Pope? Not everybody practices the same religion for a reason. It’s because of their beliefs. You might be disappointed to learn that they’re not all seeking a global religion as you are.He also suggested that he was involved in changing the Catholic Church, noting that the medieval theologians taught that the Church is always in need of reform. “This is progress,” the Marxist progressive said. He added, “The greatest reformers of the Church are saints: men and women who follow and practice the word of the Lord and have their soul filled with the gospel.” We can expect some word twisting proclamations based upon some saints in the near future.Always timing his proclamations to coincide with other events for greater effect, Frank matched this speech with a phony UN generated 2017 World Day of Migrants and Refugees. All of you European “hypocrites” who don’t want to be damned listen up; open up your borders and hand over your countries. The serpent in the white robes commands it.Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'Pope Frank, the liberal future head of the Global Church of Anything Goes, is working to create his New World Order facade of a church, following a proven path of dilution to the point of irrelevance and extermination. It’s a tactic used in the United States by the current authoritarians in power to destroy our nation and the “curse of the white boys.”They’ve opened the borders in order to completely dilute our culture, even admitting their sins to a limited degree as their zealous pursuit of multiculturalism and diversity. Both of  those deceptive terms mask the true goal of eliminating white people and white rule. They are stealing the nation from those who built it and handing it over to those who had nothing to do with it and certainly don’t deserve it.It takes a little time but their plan is well on its way to completion. The successful acquisition of points of vulnerability that had to be taken over, Congress and key congressional leadership positions, as well as the media and White House, have eliminated much of what should be overwhelming opposition. Similar moves have been made in the judiciary, all the way up to the Supreme Court.It’s no surprise, in view of the global nature of the takeover, that the Marxist Jesuit Pope, Franco of Argentina, would be elevating his like-minded liberal minions throughout the Catholic Church hierarchy as well. He’s got some serious social engineering to accomplish and those are the kind of people he’s seeking out for his own unholy version of commie “yes we can” change for the worse.Frank spoke through his actions on Sunday when he promoted “three new American cardinals seen as belonging to the centrist, non-cultural warrior wing of the country’s hierarchy.” That’s mixed-company, politically correct speak for leftist radicals, the kind that will be active in reconstruction under Pope Frank away from the Catholic Church as it is known. Earth worship, mass relocation of Islamists into Christian nations and the diminishing of current beliefs, such as those against abortion, either are or will increasingly become, the order of the day.The Catholic news site LifeSite was particularly concerned with one of the more prominent appointments, Archbishop Blase Cupich, who shares a Chicago connection with the current White House occupant and other infamous radicals. They described him as potentially “the most dangerous”-to-the-faith bishop in the United States” noting that he “has undergone a rapid increase in status and influence in the Church under Pope Francis.”In all Bergoglio the Horrible named 17 new Cardinals, all liberals, passing over senior, more qualified conservatives in the process. Thirteen of them will be able to vote for the next pope, now much more likely to also be a leftist radical.At the same time the communist Pope was poisoning the well of future Church leadership and doctrine, he was reaching out to Islamists for help in his plan to create a global religion, or more correctly, a global denunciation and subjugation of Christianity. For some reason he sees the Catholic Church’s future as being under the sandal of the new universal religion, Islam.Pope Frank announced that he has invited a delegation from the French Council of the Muslim Faith (CFCM) to visit him in the Vatican on November 3. The organization’s president, three vice-presidents and secretary general will travel to Rome for a little interfaith chit-chat, according to French media sources. Maybe they’ll find time to squeeze in a Koran reading as well.The secretary general for the Islamists, Adballah Zekri, is quoted as having said, “I am very happy to meet the Pope because he is a man of dialogue and a man of peace.” Man of dialogue means he’s willing to negotiate things away and peace, to their ear, is synonymous with weakness and submission.The specific motivations behind the action of Bergoglio may be unknown to outsiders, but the general effect is undeniable. He’s working to subordinate the Catholic Church and by extension Christianity as a whole, to Islam at the same time he elevates the earth worship of global warming to equal standing and presses and enables the dispersal of Islamic hordes throughout the civilized world.It’s certainly not very Pope-like behavior but aside from some ceremonial protocols and the uniform, there’s not much Pope-ish about the Jesuit Bergoglio in general. There is much for which Catholics and non-Muslims of every stripe should be concerned.Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'As per usual here in the United States, a progressive loses to the person the mainstream media paints as unacceptable, and individuals start displaying the Pavlovian reaction they have been taught to enact.  Donald Trump wins the Electoral College vote for president, and a bunch of people who fell for the George Soros public relations plan known as Black Lives Matter, and the special snowflakes currently infesting American colleges and universities started hyperventilating in shock, and the whole lot is up in arms, including violence toward other Americans.Not only have they started to riot, burn stuff in the middle of streets and spray paint “Die Whites Die” on monuments, various members of this contingent feel no remorse in pulling private citizens from their vehicles and beating the crap out of them.  Watch:One does not know where to begin with this.  The people doing the beating of a man and stealing of his private property simply because he voted in a way they were taught to abhor was bad enough, but the cheering section was downright hateful.And that is the irony.  Ever since the protesting and gaslighting of the mobs following the Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014, we in the United States have heard nothing but charges of racism against police, whites who support non-progressive causes and candidates, and Republicans.  Anyone who dared challenge the narrative that an unarmed teenager was shot and killed by police unfairly (he was 18, and weighed over 300 pounds. He WAS a lethal weapon), was called all manner of foul names.  We were called hateful, racist, bigot, prejudiced, and worse.  Yet, we were not the ones committing violence against other Americans, and we were not the ones violating civil rights, and destroying property, even after Barack Obama was elected the second time.  The mob is and was.In the succeeding two years since Ferguson, mob action has been the modus operandi of the easily agitated as sponsored, ultimately, by a man wanted in other countries for crimes against humanity.  His name is George Soros, you know EXACTLY who he is.One of the most gratifying pieces of evidence in the entire cache of 50,000+ of John Podesta’s emails as released by WikiLeaks, as well as some other leaked information, was the absolute proof that George Soros and his Open Society Foundation formulated the exact scenario we witnessed put into action in 2014, which has continued unabated since. It is the same violence and “protesting” we are suffering through today, and all because the mob, the proletariat as it were, has been victimized through systematic psyops from the mainstream media in the form of gaslighting resulting in what is essentially Stockholm Syndrome triggered by Pavlovian bells.Yes, that is a lot of authentic psycho-babble, but it is the case.  The mob has been put up to the criminal, and very unAmerican behavior we see unfolding yet again.And they are blaming people who did nothing other than show up to vote for the person who we all believe will best serve our interests.',fake

'Remember back a ways in the 2016 election campaign when there were people dressed as Donald Duck hanging out at Donald Trump rallies with signs that said, “DONALD DUCKS”?  Specifically, they were discussing Trump not releasing his tax returns, but where the actual slogan and tactic came from is rather fascinating.  Hillary Clinton herself came up with that, and one of her SuperPACs – in a blatant violation of campaign law – made it happen.“In the end, it was the candidate, Hillary Clinton, the future president of the United States, who wanted ducks on the ground,” says Creamer in one of several exchanges. “So, by God, we would get ducks on the ground.”It is made clear that high-level DNC operative Creamer realized that this direct coordination between Democracy Partners and the campaign would be damning when he said: “Don’t repeat that to anybody.”This is a statement included in the latest undercover video from James O’Keefe of Project Veritas.  This third video outlining the corruption and deceit of the Democratic Party and the Hillary Clinton Campaign for president is below for your viewing.This writer agrees with the reporters.  The Donald Duck gimmick was silly.  (Stupid, really, but then Hillary Clinton is a lawyer, not a public relations or advertising creative staffer.)However, what the incident goes to show is just how intertwined the effort to get Hillary Clinton into the White House really is.  There are lines being crossed that are not supposed to be crossed.  Period.  The political action committees are not supposed to be taking orders or “clearing” their messaging with either of the national party committees.  That’s not their place in the food chain, and yes, this does smack directly of collusion.  The trademark and copyright issues would have been a red herring, and a side show, regardless of Disney and ABC wigging out about something that most Americans would roll their eyes to even think about.Rigged, crooked, wrong – use any modifier in the thesaurus, and it all adds up to the same thing: law and legality means nothing to the Democrats or the Clintons.  It’s for the little people.',fake
'Every video that James O’Keefe’s Project Veritas releases is a bombshell for someone.  With his latest offering, “Major Hillary Donor Inside Dem Fundraiser: Blacks Are “Seriously F***ed in The Head,”” O’Keefe exposes the overt racism expressed in private by some of Hillary Clinton’s most ardent supporters.The undercover segments feature Benjamin Barber, a donor to Democratic candidate for Senate Deborah Ross, who also has some racist – and patently untrue – things to say.  Their words are then shown in video form to black pastors who are active in the Civil Rights movement.  It’s amazing what happens when the truth comes to light.It is stunning to think that politicians and those who are politically connected are so depraved that they will use Americans against their own self interests to gain power and prestige. The entire idea that women and minorities do not have identification is absurd on its face and illogical considering in this country we all must have state issued photo IDs to work, and to receive federal benefits.  And, after all, that is what civil rights is all about in the end.  And then to compare blacks doing the dirty work for Democrats to Sonderkommandos, is just an insult.Without getting too deep in the weeds about rage and resentment, it is very obvious from the way these Democrats and Democratic operatives talk about blacks, or African-Americans, that their loyalty is assumed.  President Johnson’s Great Society is still considered to be the leash that keeps them in the Democratic fold even if they are constantly voting against their self interest.  That is just nasty.No, this Project Veritas video does not feature any of the current regime in charge or the Hillary Clinton people.  The people in it, though, are indicative of the atmosphere inside the Democratic Party.  They pigeonhole Americans into labeled constituencies and assume that they will be loyal thanks to the goodies handed out and lip service to their cultural pathologies.  If that isn’t racist and sexist, the definition needs to be changed.',fake

This is the time we have been warned about for as long as we can remember, when our nation would be defeated by forces that exist within our own government. It’s happening and these traitors on display are part of the extensive sales team. “Just trust them,” they say, they’ll tell us what to think. We can all just go back to sleep secure in the knowledge that our watchdog media is on the job. They’ll wake us if there’s anything we need to know about. Now we’re waking to find our watchdog has chewed the carpet and peed on the couch.Many Americans are falling for the trap. These devils are the ones who provide us with supposed surveys that show the corrupt criminal Hillary Clinton tied with the man of the people, Donald Trump. If they are not honest enough to report on the crimes of this government and to prosecute those who commit the crimes, why would we think they’ll be honest in providing poll results?We see the truth in the crowd sizes and enthusiastic support for Donald Trump. It’s an unwavering support because it is not about him, he simply represents us. In a time when true representative government in this nation and around the globe is becoming a charade rather than a reality, we can’t afford to let this last opportunity be stolen.Just as is the case with Hussein Obama and Hillary Clinton, we cannot believe a word that comes out of the mouths of the talking heads on television. They are deceivers by trade, paid liars of the same type as the politicians they pretend to report about. It’s all lies, there are no news reports, only scripts being read to direct us towards a predetermined outcome.How stupid would we be to believe that the massive crowds for Donald Trump that have consistently followed him everywhere he went, all around the country, are somehow an aberration, not representative of his appeal and support? Contrasted with Hillary Clinton’s anemic audiences of paid and bussed in bug-eaters, union members and “my special interest above all else” voters in the low hundreds and you have a view into the truth that cannot be hidden but which is being ignored.In all of the metrics that can be manipulated they are reporting her as equal to set the stage for the steal. In reality she’s nowhere close which is further evidence of their intention to seize power. The plan is already underway, it will happen. The establishment is protecting their figurehead from prosecution so that she can enrich herself on the way out and handoff power to their former DNC chair, a deeply embedded operative. There is no legitimacy to any of these “news” organizations. It’s just more of the theater which is going to deliver a Clinton victory no matter what we do as long as we continue to abide by their rules and play within their system.This clip is emblematic of the entire leftist control exercised through a reality simulation. Globalist CFR member and old propagandist now put out to pasture, Bob Schieffer, does his best Bill Clinton “how dare you” imitation as he feigns outrage at the uppity, unruly peasants.The arrogant piece of elitist trash sits there and indignantly condemns the state of affairs that Clinton and the globalists have brought us to, pinning the responsibility on Donald Trump for daring to stand up and speak the truth.Schieffer says, “How have we come to this? This is supposed to be a campaign for the most powerful office in the land. Here we’re marching in women, into the hall, who are supposed to be, have some relationship with one of the candidate’s spouses, and what is that supposed to prove?”As someone who is either equally stricken with the same dementia as Hillary Clinton or the same selective memory, outrage and corruption, Schieffer forgets that rape is not a relationship and that Hillary Clinton exercised gangland tactics to silence the women. She, not just her rapist husband, was and remains an abuser of these women. To make matters more offensive, Schieffer and the corrupt network he represents then proceed to join in the familiar Democrat pastime of attacking and discrediting those that threaten their power.He continues his little anti-American rant, saying, “If I’m elected I’m going to put you in jail? I mean this is what they do in banana republics.” Wake up Bobby boy, that is exactly what the criminal regime that is in power and supports Hillary Clinton has turned our nation into. It’s nice you were finally able to notice. He indignantly says, “This is the United States of America,” as if we’re supposed to ignore the corruption of his candidate due to its magnitude or the size and stature of the victim, our country and ourselves.Schieffer said, “America can do better than what we’ve seen here tonight,” ignoring the fact that it is exactly that effort to do better, to return our government to the people, out of control of the criminal, lawless elites in the form of wresting control back for the people, that he is hypocritically condemning.Blame yourself you self-righteous old fossil, and the commie bimbos and metrosexuals you share the stage with. We’re coming for our government and our country. It’s ours and we’re taking it back. It really doesn’t matter what you have to say about it.These people, this little coven of “experts” and not-so-great thinkers who attempt to herd the American people towards their global slaughterhouse have to be dismissed and recognized as the subversives that they are. Americans can’t afford to listen to them. We must listen to our fellow patriots and to our own hearts. We know what is right and true.The big steal is set, the establishment Ryan-Romney Republicans and their Democrat comrades have already combined their forces with the media to manipulate results and the messaging. We must be aware of it and prepared. We can’t allow ourselves to take the bait, or to believe the lies that they are telling.The odds are that no matter the results or how ludicrous the claims, on November 8th the cabal will report Hillary Clinton as the victor in the election. Everything points to that. We need to be prepared, every American needs to be proactive, contact the Trump campaign and offer their services to fight the inevitable. The opposition has been cultivating the Soros BLM thugs’s reputation for violence and employed the Black Panthers for a reason, intimidation. We can’t let them succeed. It’s our country, we’re taking it back.Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'Okay, America, it’s time to knock off this feigned outrage that the word “pussy” is generating.  In non-slang nomenclature, a pussy is a cat.  For all James Bond fans, Pussy is the name of the best Bond girl character ever, Pussy Galore, the pilot in the movie “Goldfinger.”  (Readers can draw their own conclusions on the connection there.)In fashion, contrary to the assertions of many a disgruntled commenter, a pussy-bow, or pussycat bow, is a specific high collar with a soft, floppy bow tied at the throat.  The term was coined in the 1930s, actually, and referred to the sort of bow that was tied around the neck of a kitten.  From Wikipedia:In 1934, the St. Petersburg Times offered a pattern for an Anne Adams dress featuring a convertible collar which could be worn in four different ways, including as “an intriguingly feminine pussy cat bow tied high under your chin.”As nothing in fashion is ever truly new, the pussy bow reappeared in the late 1940s, and again in the 1960s with designs from Coco Chanel and Yves Saint Laurent.  However, the most famous of the women in twentieth century history to wear a pussy collar as a regular feature of her wardrobe is instantly recognizable to all conservatives all over the planet.  Well over half of Lady Margaret Thatcher’s wardrobe sported the catty attire.(Photo by Keystone/Getty Images) As it happens, the pussy bow was a staple in wardrobes all over America during the 1970s and 1980s.  This writer, and the other two women in the household generally had at least one in the wardrobe at all times for a number of years.  Then, in the 1990s, the pussy bow bowed out to make way for other styles. Then, as all things old in fashion eventually become new again, in 2014, designers sent models down the runway sporting the kitten collars we now know as pussy bows.And THAT, my fellow Americans, is the style that Melania Trump so beautifully presented at the debate Sunday evening.  The pussy bow is on its way back into everyday fashion.  (It takes a few years for the runway styles to trickle down to the masses.)  Kate Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge, sported a pussy bow not too long ago.  Before too long, the rest of us will be wearing the darn things again as well.  (Doesn’t do jack for those of us with a lot of cleavage.)So, now we know.  Melania Trump’s pussy bow collar was not made up.  It was brilliant.More on the history of the pussy bow from Vogue.',fake
'The BJP has alleged that Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi violated the model code of conduct by “co-relating the Congress election symbol with religious figures”.But that’s not all what Rahul Gandhi did this week. He, in fact was very sad that MSD resigned from ODI captaincy, but that was not the sole concern for his sadness. In fact he was sad that the producers didn’t show the resignation part in the Dhoni biopic.Rahul Gandhi thought that whatever shown in the movie is the whole life of Dhoni and no big decision will be taken in future regarding his playing career, and he will keep playing and captaining for ages.

'Almost everyone with a Facebook account has voiced his or her opinion regarding the ongoing debate on whether to allow Fawad Khan starrer ADHM in India (as per the reports coming from Dharma productions office, his role is shorter than even the short name used for the film).Until yesterday the future of the movie looked bleak. However, in an unexpected turn of events the leader of the largest Democratic party of India, Raj Thackeray has given a green signal for the release of the film on a conditional basis. The condition that Raj has smartly put forward is that the producers who cast Pakistani actors in their movies will have to pay 5 crore rupees to the Indian army welfare fund as a penalty.This has come as a huge relief for Karan Johar who reported, “I am very thankful to Raj Bhai for giving the green signal for the movie. Yes, the amount I have to pay as penalty is much larger than what I paid Fawad Khan for a cameo but still I am happy as this money will be used for the sake of Indian army. Now there is no force which can stop the screening of my movie!”, a relieved KJo signed off.However, Arnab Goswami was unhappy with the proceedings. The supreme commander of the nation said, “For the past one week I have been crying hoarse to create a wave of patriotism in the country and the first step was banning films containing Pakistani actors. Yes, Raj may have given the movie a green signal but I will make sure that people don’t watch the movie on the day of its release. On the release day, I will hold Newshour for 24 hours nonstop and as you clearly know the TRP ratings of my show are so terribly high that people will not go to watch the movie but remain glued to their TV screens all day!” Arnab signed off with the chants of, “Bharat Mata ki Jai. Jai Jawaan. Jay Hindustan!”Watching all this from his cozy stallion, Lalu Prasad Yadav struck upon a golden idea. He conducted a press conference and put a proposal to Raj Thackeray that the Bihar government will also pay 5 crorer rupees if Raj allows Biharis to work in Mumbai. Our sources informed that this may be a political gimmick by Lalu as he believes that striking a compromise with Raj Thackeray will solve many issues mainly the problem of unemployment in Bihar and also he will take away one more of Modi’s friends and make a grand alliance to defeat Modi in 2019.Lalu signed off with a slogan, “Marathi- Bihari Bhau bhaiya!”It remains to be seen how Raj responds to this offer.',fake
'After successfully resolving the Ae Dil Hai Mushkil row, the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray will now take a call for India on the import of onions.The feisty politician will reportedly chair a meeting in Mumbai where he will take a tough decision on the import. Since Thackeray made it easier for the central government in dealing with the Pakistani artistes’ row, the cabinet ministers may not attend the crucial meeting.The government is quite confident that the MNS chief will resolve this issue too and that they will know of his final decision later through his press conference.Explaining Thackeray’s keenness on onions, one MNS leader said, “The issue of onions is an emotive one. How can we eat onions imported from enemy countries? In a way, it will mean the enemy made us weep as we peeled their onions. We can never have the enemy gain such a psychological edge.”If the onion decision too bears fruit, the MNS may seriously consider floating a Foreign Affairs department which will help the Indian government take decisions on outstanding issues like trade deficit with China, track two diplomacy with Pakistan, Iran gas pipeline deal, foreign-exchange reserves, etc.The Congress took this opportunity to mock the central government over its inability to take tough decisions on foreign affairs.A Congress spokesperson told The Unreal Times, “Prime Minister Narendra Modi is wasting a lot of tax payers’ money by travelling the world to strike international deals. All he should do is meet Raj Thackeray often instead of meeting world leaders like Obama or Putin. This is the first time that we have found the answers to our external problems inside the country itself.”Meanwhile Ae Dil Hai Mushkil director Karan Johar was seen doing the rounds of Thackeray’s home again. This time the filmmaker wanted to know which are the right brands of firecrackers to buy for Diwali . He was reportedly heard joking, “You know I am making sure I get this one right. Otherwise, Yeh Diwali hai mushkil.”(Originally published on Right to Laughter)',fake
'After threatening Ae Dil Hai Mushkil’s Fawad Khan to leave the country within 48 hours on Friday, MNS chief Raj Thackeray today has asked the entire cast and crew to leave the country within 48 hours.Mr. Thackeray, after issuing the ultimatum to Fawad Khan, realized he had reacted in haste and decided to watch the trailer of the movie to understand the situation better. Hence, he locked himself in his room and secretly played the trailer on YouTube.Two and half minutes later, when he came out of his room, achieving nirvana, he looked visibly shaken and refrained from discussing the experience with anyone. He, however, asked his workers to issue a statement, demanding the ouster of the entire cast and crew of the movie from India within 48 hours.“Movies like Ae Dil Hai Mushkil are the reason why people are losing faith in humanity. Raj couldn’t sleep for three days after watching the trailer and tried to figure out whether it was about a love triangle or a futile attempt to revive Aishwarya Rai’s acting career,” Shalini Thackeray, wife of MNS chief Raj Thackeray, said in a press conference.Shalini, who is the general secretary of MNS, told The Unreal Times that their Chitrapat wing has issued a 48-hour ultimatum to the entire cast and crew of the movie to leave the country.“We would also issue letters to the producers asking them on what ground they hired Aishwarya Rai when there are ample number of actors in the country and struggling to find an opportunity.”“Would you like to specify a name?” we asked.“Her husband, for one.”“But Aishwarya Rai is playing a female character and Abhishek…”“With a bit of make-up, he could easily play the character,” she asserted.We asked Raj Thackeray what MNS would do if they refuse to leave the country and he looked at us blankly for a second before the trailer he’d watched flashed through his mind, “Our workers will push them out before they release the movie,” he screamed on the verge of breaking down.However, Mumbai Police has given an assurance to the production house and said, “Anyone who has a valid document issued by the Government of India need not worry. If Bangladeshi immigrants can live here illegally without any document then why cannot they?”',fake
'Not that we in the United States didn’t know that our “leadership” really held us in contempt, but the “revelations” of Donald Trump’s alleged sexual misconduct and talk honestly demonstrates more of the attitude Lizardhead, uh, James Carville articulated in the quote above.  They think we are just like them: having a high school fascination for sex, and we’ll follow any red herring dragged in front of us.Not that an interest in sex makes any or all of us less than human, but it almost seems that liberals, Democrats, and feminists have some sort of arrested development when it comes to the topic.  It’s like they haven’t grown up despite none of them being virgins.  (The only other people known to this writer that obsessed with sex ARE virgins.) That being the case, the larger coven of “progressives” seems to think that dragging a $100 bill, or a sex scandal, through the mainstream media is going to distract the public from…well whatever it is they want to distract the people from noticing this week.Over the weekend, the locker room conversation sex tape was meant to neutralize Donald Trump at the debate.  Didn’t work.Today, Thursday, October 13, a front page New York Times story featuring a woman accusing Trump of groping her a few decades ago on a plane in first class has started to take hold in order to strengthen the meme that Trump is a disgusting misongynist.  Well, it did until Trump’s people slapped the Times with a cease and desist order, and a threat of a libel lawsuit, and The Gateway Pundit along with commenters from all over the fruited plain started to deconstruct the story.  It couldn’t have happened the way the story was told, and the accuser used lyrics from a popular song to tell the tall tale.What is going on that the people need to be distracted?  All of Clinton groupie John Podesta’s gmail account is being systematically aired out by Wikileaks.  And the revelations aren’t pretty.You can’t make this stuff – AND I’M A FICTION WRITER!What the “progressives” are doing is assuming that all of us are just like them: obsessed with sex.  And they are so obsessed with it that the proverbial shiny red balls of distraction fame for them is all about digging up dirt and violating the privacy and other rights of their targets.  If the tables were turned, most of these people wouldn’t think these tactics were nearly so acceptable.  In this case, the target – no fag choir boy – is willing to punch back.  (Progressives never seem to expect that.)As for the bottom line purpose in all of this, at some point, the American people quit paying attention to what were seen to be unfounded accusations against a successful American.  We the People also have been growing up as the economy is being kept on life support just waiting for the kill shot.  Sex doesn’t work as a distraction any more, and the progressives are under the impression that it does.  Therefore, they are going to use what has worked in the past to destroy a candidate rather than be creative and come up with something new.Well, and then there’s the little matter that they take themselves entirely too seriously, and the old hag feminists are jealous of better looking women, but we’re not supposed to mention that.',fake
'Ravish Kumar’s prime time show has been nominated for the Filmfare Awards under the category of best drama series. The Filmfare Awards Committee has unanimously decided to nominate the show after watching the thought-provoking episode titled ‘Are we to stop questioning?’ which was aired last night.During the screening of the show on NDTV India, viewers across India witnessed cinematographic brilliance, portraying the unjust system we live with, and Ravish Kumar, who previously produced the cult classic ‘The Dark Screen’ has once again won millions of hearts with his powerful performance.Although the show was primarily aimed at raising awareness about freedom of expression and highlighting the fascism that prevails in Modi’s regime, the jury members were particularly impressed by the dramatized presentation of the show by the immensely creative Ravish Kumar.The show opens with toxic air engulfing the city of Delhi, a metaphor for the oppression we have been subjected to, where the oppressor menacingly walks on the streets, keeping an eye on each and every individual.A couple of mime artists appear on the screen in the next segment and beautifully portray the ugly truth that we as a society should be ashamed of, a horrifying reality that most of us were unaware of.“The views are not only factually incorrect but also irrelevant to the issue he is trying to address,” one of the peons at The Times Group office raised an objection while serving tea to the jury members, “Isn’t this show supposed to be about the ban imposed on NDTV? The channel has been asked to go off air for leaking sensitive information but he is completely digressing here and talking about an imaginary authority that punishes those who question its actions.”“That’s called creative liberty, my friend,” asserts the jury member.The jury will decide the winner by the end of this month and the award will be formally presented at 62nd Britannia Filmfare Awards to be held next year.Meanwhile, TV production houses were queuing up to rope in Ravish Kumar for their next ventures after watching his show, but Balaji telefilms has apparently won the race. Sources revealed that he could be seen in the upcoming season of Kumkum Bhagya.',fake
'Refugees: The United States isn’t the only country that has a two-tiered system of “justice,” one for the elites, illegals, terrorists, Islamists and George Soros thugs that destroy our cities and assault people in the name of their black racism and another for the law-abiding American citizens. We’re not alone in having a gangster government that exempts themselves for compliance, that allows special interests and protected classes to enjoy immunity from the law while persecuting our native, majority population.Germany, under the fascist EU dictator Angela Merkel, also has a similar and in some ways more compromised mob government that is, as the criminal Democrat regime is doing in America, flooding their nation with terrorists, terror sympathizers, terrorist interns and a few non-terrorist Islamist’s to offer cover for the rest.Merkel doesn’t care what the background is of the invaders she’s importing. As long as they are Muslims she figures everything else is going to work out the way she and her globalist comrades have planned. The invasion is all deliberately imposed upon the people of Europe as is being done to the Americans, in order to change their culture from that of Western Christianity to Middle Eastern Islamo-tyranny.Falsifying a passport is a crime in Germany, just as document fraud is a crime in America, with a penalty of five years in prison. If a white German were to commit that crime in his own native land, he’d be in a heap of trouble. For unknown foreigner invaders pretending to be someone they aren’t, bringing with them unknown risks to the German people, it’s no big deal. The Germans just let them in, ignore the crime and ignore the fact that they have no clue who is now roaming among their citizens. Maybe they won’t blow them up or attack them in a theater, mall, airport or train station.Surprisingly, the German federal migrant agency is admitting to the security failures, acknowledging that they routinely allow invaders to enter even though they are fully aware that the documents they have presented are forged. A recently released report identifies the German agency in charge of “migration,” the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), as turning a blind eye to forged documents. A report in Die Welt establishes that of 217,465 passports, birth certificates and driver’s licenses used by those granted asylum, 2,273 were known forgeries. Nobody was arrested and their applications were processed as if they were legitimate.There is a strange kind of self-destruction taking place when a nation invites criminals, which is what those using fake documents are, into their midst. It’s worse when you can’t establish who or what those people really are. Just as with the illegals in the United States using the stolen identification of Americans, nothing has happened. The IRS doesn’t even share the information with the victim and they continue to allow the offending illegal to use the documents, to remain in the United States, and to work under someone else’s name.German law enforcement is quite concerned over the risks associated with the refugees fraudulent passports, with the Federation of German Detectives (BDK) having called for them to be informed in instances of suspected fraud. As is typical with the pro-invasion government criminals, the BAMF says that’s not their job. BAMF vice-chairman Michael Bohl said it isn’t “up to the discretion of BAMF to decide if the law had been broken or not.” It would be fitting if the next terrorist victims are members of their families. Maybe it would become their jobs then.German immigration rules require that any asylum seeker that has either withheld information regarding their nationality or attempted to deceive authorities is to have their claim immediately rejected. You can’t get much more deceptive than falsified passports but no punitive action has yet been taken in any of the cases.It’s not surprising that the same corruption and manipulation of the system is evident both here and in Europe as we are both in the throes of a battle for our survival against the same global government criminals. The tactics are the same, regardless of the location. Passports are one tool of deception, but the deception has many forms and it is everywhere.Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) is one of the few good guys in Congress. He’s been vocal in challenging the anti-American predators in Obama’s EPA who want to strangle our citizens in the name of global citizenship. He’s equally willing to take on those within the GOP who share that same lack of integrity, moral foundation, sense of duty to their nation and complete dearth of patriotism. He spoke specifically of the turncoat pantywaist Paul Ryan.Rep Rohrabacher described Ryan as “cowardly” for his conference call announcement that he would not be helping Donald Trump to win the presidency and would not campaign with him or on his behalf.  Rohrabacher said, “Leaders are supposed to stand firm and solid in moments of crisis. Instead, he’s in a panic. It’s not good leadership. … I think the Republicans who are backing away are gutless.” He added, “We don’t have to just be concerned about saving House seats. We have to be concerned about saving the United States of America.”Congressman Rohrabacher is giving Ryan too much credit. Ryan is concerned with his power and position alone, as Speaker. He’s not interested in doing with it what will be best for our nation or our citizens, only obeying the commands of those who placed him there. He’s focusing on House seats because without the majority he doesn’t get to play “Mr. Important Lawmaker” anymore and much of his power and prestige disappears. Power and its rewards are what truly matter to Ryan.Saving the United States is not a concern of Paul Ryan. He doesn’t see our demise as something negative but as our future as part of the global one world government that he promotes. The gelatin-like spine of Mr. Ryan does not permit him to support a real man like Trump, but it does allow him to still technically, officially not oppose him. He hasn’t withdrawn his tepid, limp-wristed endorsement just yet. That’s the one traitorous card he is still holding in his hand, yet to be played, raised and poised at the ready.Rohrabacher wants no part of their betrayal. He’s solidly behind Mr. Trump and the United States of America. Regardless of the outcome of the election, we may see a different Speaker for the next session. Ryan should never have been there in the first place and were it not for the surrender of the naive Freedom Caucus, would not have been.The Congressional GOP jellyfish could learn a lot about being a representative from Rep Rohrabacher. Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'The mainline Democrats shrug off Donald Trump’s assessment that the American political system is rigged, but there are many people in the country who agree with him.  One of those people is documentary producer Jeff Hays.  Hays and his team of filmmakers followed Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson around on the campaign trail in 2015 and 2016, and were able to put together a documentary that is sure to confirm Mr. Trump’s astute opinion of the American political system.Their goal with Rigged 2016 is to expose the masses to Johnson and help him to get his poll numbers high enough to be invited to the presidential debates, which right now include only Democratic nominee Clinton and Republican nominee Trump.“The big lie is we only have two choices,” says Byrne. “Let the people compare him to the other two. He’ll mop the floor with them.”Byrne refers to Patrick Byrne of Overstock.com who financed the project with $400 million.  For anyone who has paid attention this year to Gary Johnson and the other third party candidates this political season, the hope of launching Johnson to the White House is a bit of a pipe dream.  No, the choices from the main political parties are not ideal by any means, but neither Johnson or Jill Stein of the Green Party are cut out for the job.However, the main point of the documentary is well taken.  The system as we know it in the United States is rigged.  It is rigged toward established corporate interests who have no interest in anything more than their bottom lines.  The people calling the shots certainly do not have the welfare of the American people, or our mental health, on their list of priorities.And that, ultimately, is the point.',fake

'Delhi/NCR: Bikers in this part of the country always come up with the unique ways to surpass cars/trucks/buses and get ahead on the road in this unofficial race that keeps on happening on Indian Roads. Sometimes, when roads do not have enough space, footpaths come to their rescue. Some great man once under the influence of weed said-“Necessity is the mother of invention.”It became a famous quote henceforth. People in the automobile sector were seriously thinking about the troubles faced by these bikers on roads to stay ahead, and hence have come up with the unique plan to introduce rubber bikes with slim tyres.On being asked about the advances of this sort of bikes, the reply came:“You can bend the handles. It will help you pass through the lesser space. Some adventurous bikers who are capable of stunts can use the feature to pass from below the bus. No car, no bus and no truck can stop you from staying ahead. This is the future,” company director Tagda Champu, CEO of Khujli Bikes informed us.Our reporter Chatur Khujli placed his car keys on the table as tears came down his cheeks. Driving on the road was going to be very difficult from this point onwards.Slim tyres give you an opportunity to travel through very little space, with your current driving habits. Places where fat ones do not enter, these slim tyres give you a different dimension altogether. Company director Tagda Champu, CEO of Khujli Bikes informed us.It has a mileage of 200 KM/Ltr.Chatur Khujli, our reporter asked him what new engines have they built, in order to achieve this tremendous mileage.“Actually to achieve the principles of this rubber bike, we had to get rid of the petrol tank.

Why is this ltr part even there?”“Oh That is under test conditions. We tested in extreme Himalayan conditions, and asked testers to come downhill. The entire journey was almost 200 KM and he drank a litre of water during the journey. Hence the mileage. This is marketing my friend!” Tagda Champu replied.',fake
'Vladimir Zhirinovsky is the leader of Russia’s third largest political party, the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia. He’s a fierce combination nationalist and populist with a style that is described as brash and confrontational. Though generally regarded as being anti-Western, this member of the Russia State Duma, the lower house of Parliament does have an opinion on the American election. He might be a hardliner but he’s not suicidal. He, like most of the rest of the world, has had enough of Hussein Obama and is opposed to four more years of the world spinning around the globalist drain.In an interview from his large, tenth floor office, Zhirinovsky told Reuters that those Americans who want peace must vote for Donald Trump. It is his opinion that Trump is the only person able to deescalate dangerous tensions between Moscow and Washington.He said, “Americans, when they vote for president on November eighth, must realize that they are voting for peace on planet earth if they vote for Trump. But if they vote for Hillary, it’s war.”He continued, “Trump will have a brilliant chance to make relations more peaceful. To start talks, to take positive decisions on Syria and Ukraine, on NATO, on disarming and plutonium. He is the only one that can do this.”As for the hand-wringing in the media over Trump’s comments, Zhirinovsky takes a realistic approach, saying, “Men all around the world sometimes say such things that are just for their comrades. They’re just saying, but that doesn’t mean that it is an attitude towards women, children, black people and Muslims.He adds, “Victory for Trump and his election as president would be a gift to humanity. This is no joke.”  While it wasn’t exactly an endorsement from Putin himself, the point is made that Zhirinovsky is allied with and faithful to Kremlin policy. The impression is given that he would not be making such statements without the approval, at least tacitly, of Vladimir Putin.Putin knows what happened in the Middle East and Libya. He knows what kind of criminal and traitor Hillary Clinton is. With a nationalist loyal to his own nation, Putin would have a dependable and consistent adversary or perhaps an ally in some areas. In the case of Hillary Clinton, he’d be dealing with a globalist servant that would inevitably seek to destabilize his own nation or regions of the globe Russia has an interest in.It seems obvious that it is in Russia’s interest to see Mr. Trump elected; that Mr. Zhirinovsky’s words have the ring of truth to them.',fake
'The weasel is out of the bag and its name is Paul Ryan. Jack Posobiec, the Special Projects Director for Citizens For Trump, tells a tale of deception and betrayal of the most despicable kind, and  it revolves around a power play made by the vile filth, the rodent Rep Paul Ryan, a subhuman mongrel that has shamed the entire state of Wisconsin.As it turns out, the video of Trump and Billy Bush that was leaked from unknown sources has been traced back to Ryan. The anti-Trump operatives never bothered to investigate the source, those on the networks, the GOP establishment and the Clinton campaign were just happy it had appeared and were delighting in the feeding frenzy intent on driving him out of the race.Ryan’s little event in Wisconsin was to be the stage for him to feign his indignation and then dismiss Mr. Trump in unison with their fellow operatives such as Senator Mike Lee of Utah. When critical mass was reached they would use an unwitting and uninvolved Governor Mike Pence as the vehicle into which to attach themselves in Trump’s place.Trump would be forced out, Pence would move to the top of the ticket and Paul Ryan would slide in. Clinton would still likely win, which is completely acceptable and the lesser of the two evils for the establishment whores in the GOP. They would then focus their efforts on picking up the globalist pieces with a Ryan/Rubio ticket for 2020.Once again, according to Posobiec, those who targeted Mr. Trump underestimated him. They thought they could force him to quit, which he does not do. They also thought that Paul Ryan was equal in stature as a candidate to the man we all are demanding to be our next president.This was a failed coup in no exaggeration of the terms. Now the participants are becoming fully exposed. There will be a price for them to pay.Listen to “[GUEST ONLY] Jack Posobiec/Cari Kelemen (10/11) “Explosive Revelation of GOP Coup Attempt!”” on Spreaker.Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'Sachin Tendulkar’s much talked about Smartron smartphone which was launched today amidst rave reviews also got some flak after reports of ‘battery issue’ surfaced in the media.Many first time users reported that the smartphone fails to charge beyond 99\% even after extended hours of charging, which made them wonder if this was intended or some glitch in the product.Speaking to Faking News, one such user said, “I am a fan of Sachin and was waiting for this product to be launched. But the moment I started charging it, the battery displayed full charge at 99\%. Initially it looked like a bug. But when others too reported the same issue. I thought it was some smartphone feature specific to this product,” said Rohan Salgaokar, an MBA student.Loyal fans of the master blaster were angry, some even thought that the company trolling Sachin and refused to buy the phone till the problem was rectified. “I can understand that the smartphone needs to have features that remind us of Sachin. But this 99\% charge is not in good taste. If this is not rectified we will boycott the product,” said an angry Sanjay Mhatre, President of Sachin Tendulkar Fans Union (STFU).STFU has also asked its yuva members to stop attending schools, colleges and offices till their demands are met. “Just like how Sachin bhau bunks Rajya Sabha, we will also bunk college and office,” said one member.To prevent this matter from snowballing into a major controversy, makers of the smartphone have assured that the matter will be looked into.

'For the first time in over 50 years, the police department in Palm Springs, California, is mourning the loss of officers killed in the line of duty.  Three officers were shot answering a domestic disturbance call on Saturday, two of them dying due to their wounds.The deceased are 35-year veteran Jose Gilbert “Gil” Vega who was due to retire in less than a year, and Lesley Zerebny who was with the force only a year and half and gave birth to a daughter only four months earlier.  The third officer is alert and responsive.(Via USA Today) “Today Palm Springs lost two brave officers,” Palm Springs Police Chief Bryan Reyes said at a news conference, his voice shaking with emotion. “I am awake in a nightmare right now.”Shortly after noon, dozens of police descended on a Palm Springs residence in response to a call for help from the scene.  According to reports, the suspect in the case simply opened fire.“It was a simple family disturbance and he elected to open fire,” Reyes said….Witnesses said they heard between 10 and 20 gunshots from what sounded like machine guns. Over a dozen patrol cars, three fire engines and a SWAT truck were at the scene of the incident at 2 p.m.Officers searched the surrounding area while residents of Palm Springs laid flowers in a make-shift memorial at the police station.  Fellow officers did try to revive Zerebny to no avail.One person at the scene indicated that the story is not nearly as cut and dried as the suspect just opening fire.Frances Serrano, who lives directly across the street from where the shooting took place, spoke to the father of the suspected shooter moments before the incident. The father told Serrano that his son, who has mental issues, had a gun and wanted to shoot police officers.“He came over and asked for help,” she said.',fake
'Indian literature body, the Sahitya Akademi has reached out to Rio hero and Indian gymnast Dipa Karamkar, who recently returned a BMW car gifted to her by Bharat Ratna Sachin Tendulkar. In a letter to the athlete, the Akademi has sought a clarification from her whether she returned her car in protest against the “rising intolerance” in the country.“In recent times, we’ve seen a lot of valuable awards and medals being returned to us, all in protest against the ‘rising intolerance’ in the country under PM Modi. So when we heard the news of Dipa wanting to return her BMW, we obviously thought that she too, was joining the chorus. But we’ve now heard from her that it was due to narrow roads in Agartala and high maintenance costs. That’s fine. But we do want to tell Dipa that if ever she changes her mind and wants to return it to us instead, in protest against rising intolerance, our doors are open,” Akademi president Dr. Vishwanath Prasad Tiwari told The UnReal Times.The news has brought disappointment to ‘rising intolerance’ campaign initiator and Sahitya Akademi awardee Nayantara Sahgal. While Sahgal hailed the Akademi for proactively reaching out to the athlete, she also expressed her disappointment at the clarification. “So far, it’s just medals and awards. A BMW returned by the gymnast would’ve made our campaign leap to a whole new level altogether, but alas. Speaking of returns, it’s been a while since I recollected my returned award. May be it’s time I returned it again,” the awardee stated.Bollywood director Mahesh Bhatt termed the return as a wasted opportunity. “Forget this rising intolerance stuff. Dipa should have used this opportunity to return the award against the ongoing war-mongering in the country. Being the strong lady that she is, she should’ve stated loud and clear that she will claim her BMW back only when peace has been made with Pakistan,” the director said, before tweeting (others’) quotes of wisdom. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, however, already jumped the gun, tweeting a customary “proud of u” message to the athlete.Sports Minister Vijay Goel said that he respected Dipa’s decision in addition to requesting her for a selfie with the car before she returned it. The UnReal Times reached out to Bollywood actor Aamir Khan for his views on the issue, but the actor declined after his better half Kiran Rao threatened to leave the country if he answered any more questions on intolerance.',fake
'Salman Khan recently shared the first look of Race 3, which is the third installation of the Race series.The actor has begun shooting for the film, which is directed by part-time director and full-time reality show judge Remo D’Souza. Salman, who is all excited for the high-on-action film, revealed that he’s put his blood and sweat in it as he has been preparing for this role since 2002. The first two films of the Race series were about fast cars and mind-boggling suspense in the form of twists and turns. Talking about how his life has been a near-similar race, Salman said, “The film is about fast driving; even if you are under the influence of alcohol, you must know how to be safe. In the first two films, you saw how fast the cars were driven on the road. In Race 3, we’ll be conquering footpaths as well.”The actor, in a press conference, revealed that he’s been “preparing for this role since 2002… September 2002, to be particular… 28th September, 2002, to be precise”, and that it is “not quite a movie that challenged his acting skills”. Remo D’Souza, who took a leave from judging the reality show on the day, was present at the press conference. “Race 3 is a thriller that will up your adrenaline levels. The suspense in the film will spin your head to the extent where you will never know who the real villain is, even after 15 years from the release of the film,” he said while giving a high-5 to Salman. Salman faces immense pressure to deliver a hit after his last film, Tubelight, did not light up the box office. “If Race 3 does well, I will earn 300 crores. In case the film fails at the box office, my driver will publicly accept that the actor in the film was him, not I. Moreover, I will also donate some amount in charity so my fans can excuse a bad film,” Salman joked. To assure the distributors and stakeholders of the film, Salman went a step ahead and explained, “If good films like Newton and Hindi Medium can earn 10-20 crores, I’m sure that the Indian audiences will help Race 3 cross the 300-crore mark. I have full faith in judici… err, in my fans,” he said, before concluding the press conference.',fake
'Maybe you have to be dumb enough to be a liberal not to see through this stunt or to at least be dishonest enough to pretend that you’re too stupid to see it for what it is.The original lie in which the supposedly honest Pope Frank played a role was the “spontaneous” recognition of the little girl,  Sophia Cruz, as she ran into the street as his motorcade approached. Sure, security is that loose and don’t bother with any child endangerment investigation, they’re running a scam on America that is both Pope and Obama approved.In that instance she delivered a scripted note to Pope Frank, before Trump ever announced for president. This time around, the child of illegals squatting in our nation is once again being given an orchestrated national platform. She’s the next Khizr Khan or Alicia Machado, the Democrat personalization of “how heartless and cruel” Donald Trump is.It’s being reported that Cruz may be fed another question to put her name at the bottom of and take her position as the Donald Trump victim of the week, with another scripted message being plagiarized as her own. This time the note being written for her will be read aloud and is reported to contain the following: “If you deport my parents, what happens to me? I am 6 years old and an American citizen. I have a 3 year old sister who is also an American. My heart is very sad, because I’m scared that ICE is going to deport my undocumented mommy and daddy.” The note, intended to sound like a six-year-old wrote it and not a Clinton staffer, is posted on the Open Debate Coalition website.It’s obvious that a six-year-old didn’t write it. The structure, while simple, is still much above the level of a first grader. She knew to use the pronoun “an” instead of “a,” pretty good for a kid that lives in a Spanish-speaking household. She also knew that “Immigre” is really called ICE is all capitalized although she did erroneously use the word undocumented to describe her illegal alien squatting foreigner parents.The question, intended to damage Trump and pave the way for a range of insults to be unloaded upon him over the course of the next week or so, is posted as hers at the website presidentialopenquestions.com, where the “thirty top questions” will be “considered” by the biased ABC and CNN moderators for the debates. Does anybody smell a setup?The correct answer to the question is that the little girl packs her bags and goes with her parents while they petition to return legally. She could also stay with other family members if she has any, in America who are legally here. Going back to Mexico or whatever country her parents belong in is the same situation she’d have been in had they not broken our laws. Now she has the benefit of American citizenship for later in life.That was easy; next question.Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake

Samsung has recalled all the faulty phones, but now the terrorists want them at a premium price so that they can use them as a weapon.The phones will come at a cheaper price as compared to guns, grenades and other weapons. Terrorists are trying to figure out a way to clear all phones from the market and supply it to their colleagues who can then use them as weapons.Well, it’s a dangerous situation for Samsung as they would not want their products to be used by terrorists.

'Brussels: There is a bad news for the entire scientific community searching for extra terrestrial life outside of earth. A group of researchers based in Brussels have claimed that life is only possible on planet earth, adding that, we homo sapiens are indeed special.Humans have been desperately searching for clues of life in our solar system and other galaxies, even those that are millions of light years away from us, hoping that we someday receive a radio signal from them, and send a ‘acklowledgement’ signal back that reaches them millions of years from now. Humans are definitely not likely to survive by that time, and hence this exercise is widely believed as an attempt to frustrate aliens.This discovery by researchers has come as a big blow to the SETI project, that searches for alien life throughout the universe. Humans are wondering whether the money spent on this fruitless exercise could be put to better use such as saving life back here, and its possibility in future.When asked, a member of the research team revealed that they came to this conclusion based on the fact that all the Miss Universe contest winners so far have been from our world alone.“It would be very arrogant to think that we’re the only beautiful species throughout the universe, of a size it’s impossible for human brain to imagine. So, if alien life really existed, they would definitely have participated in this contest of prestige, and won several awards, but that’s not the case,” explained the member.“We modeled the universe in 4D, based on this important fact through supercomputer simulation and found no traces of life in our model right since big bang to end of the universe. Hence proved- we’re at the center of this universe, as believed in ancient universe models, and that, we’re the one!” said the lead researcher.',fake
'There are many questions that the sheeple of America need to ask themselves before they vote for their globalist slave master and tool of Saudi Arabia, Hillary Clinton.

The video notes it is possible she could soon become Chief of Staff at the White House, if the coup that is currently underway is successful.\r\nThe narrator starts by identifying four primary players in the events surrounding the Clinton-Saudi situation, Hillary Clinton, Huma Abedin, Abdullah Omar Nasseef and Saudi Arabia.

'Former India opener Virender Sehwag’s childhood coach Amar Nath Sharma slammed BCCI’s decision to conduct interviews for coaches via Skype. Only Sehwag was present physically at the Wankhede Stadium’s Cricket Centre in Mumbai for the interview. But maybe the final outcome was not based on performance only. There are rumors doing rounds that Sehwag under performed in the interview to keep Shastri away from the commentary box.Most of the media houses reported that Sehwag was a strong contender for the post citing the not so warm Sourav-Ravi equation. Even Indian fans wanted Sehwag to bring that aggressive intent in the dressing room. But sources say Sehway was in a big dilemma. After taking up commentary, Sehwag had a dream of becoming the most followed commentator in the world and for it to happen, he had to plan the ouster  of Ravi Shastri from the commentary box. He gave in to such dreams and tanked the interviews, something b-school students when forcefully interviewed for companies they don’t want to join.But Sehwag has denied such rumors and said,” The rumors are baseless. Why would I under perform to keep Shastri out of commentary box. Shastri’s commentary has reached such levels of boredom that in the coming months, broadcasters themselves will throw him out like a  tracer bullet.  When I gave the interview all three results were possible, 1. I lose 2. I win 3. I under perform. But I chose to lose rather than under perform. Sehwag has never under performed and Sehwag will never under perform. My wishes to Ravi and am sure he will take team India to new heights, I mean to clubs which are located on mountains.”Our Faking News team will try and bring out the truth in the matter, but till than lets hope Kohli and boys have some great time under coach Ravi.',fake
'Television movie channel Set Max announced a Diwali bonanza for its viewers after various channels threw their schemes to attract maximum number of viewers. The channel, which holds the official broadcasting rights of Sooryavansham, starring Amitabh Bachchan and Amitabh Bachchan in grey beard, has decided to air the film four times on the day of the festival.After getting several requests from viewers to stop airing the same movie every night, the producers at the channel have become even more adamant. Explaining us the reason behind trying to make Sooryavansham everyone’s most hated movie, a channel executive said, “Like the teenager who has many clothes in his wardrobe but still wears the same pair, we have a great collection of movies in our library but will still air Sooryavansham every night, and we will continue to do so.” A Delhi-based viewer has also filed a complaint in the consumer court against the movie channels. “In my complaint, I have specified that all these channels air dubbed movies from the South all day, which is as attempt to influence our culture. We do not even know the difference between Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam movies, so why show it to us all day?” said the aggrieved viewer.Actor Amitabh Bachchan, who plays a double role in Sooryavansham, has distanced himself from the makers of the film. He further intends to buy the broadcasting rights of the film from Set Max. “They show it every night! On Diwali, they have planned to make it more miserable for me. I will buy the broadcasting rights of the movie so that the channel cannot air it,” said the worried actor.

'Three of Bill and Hillary Clinton’s many victims sat down for an interview with Aaron Klein at the Watergate Hotel in Washington DC, to give the world a wake-up call about the sexual predators that are attempting to manipulate their way back into the White House.Kathleen Willey, Paula Jones and Juanita Broaddrick know firsthand the criminality of the Clintons, having experienced rape and sexual assault by the former president. They have also been victims of the personal attacks against their character, threats and intimidation inflicted upon them by his enabler and cover person, his wife Hillary Clinton.They want everyone to know that Hillary Clinton is not an advocate for women, as Willey describes her, “she is a fake feminist.” They say Hillary Clinton took an adversarial approach from the beginning towards them, having never once attempted to talk to any of them. They note that had Clinton reached out and talked to them she would have found out that they were telling the truth, the true nature of what her husband had done to them. But she never did, “because she didn’t care to.”Asked if they believe Hillary is an enabler, Broaddrick responds, “Oh my goodness, there’s not a better word, for any of this, especially when she threatened me personally.” Willey adds, “She’s implicit in everything he’s done.” Paula Jones adds, “She’s helped him do it.”Klein asks how they respond to those who dismiss their claims as “Bill’s infidelities.” Jones replies, “We didn’t agree to do this stuff, he pushed himself on us.” Broaddrick says, “This is criminal. We were not willing to the acts that he performed. We were not willing participants. These were crimes.”Kathleen Willey says, “Rape, sexual assault, sexual harassment, I want to say this to the mainstream media, Andrea Mitchell, Jake Tapper, all of these people. These are not infidelities. A rape is not an infidelity. These are crimes. Any other people would be in jail. They would be in jail for a very long time. This is no longer about infidelity, indiscretions, girlfriends, sex, interns, none of those. This is about a serial rapist, a predator, and his wife, who has enabled his behavior all of these years.”Paula Jones adds, “And he exposed himself to me, that’s a crime. You’re not supposed to expose yourself to people.”They point out that Hillary has turned a blind eye to the actions of her husband over all of these years and she has been the one to help cover it up and go after them.The thought of  Hillary Clinton having the military, NSA, CIA, multiple intelligence agencies at her disposal as president, the most powerful person in the world, a frightening prospect for the ladies. They say it should terrify all people.Willey warns, “She will annihilate any enemy, all of her enemies, anybody who’s spoken against her, across the board for I don’t know how many years, she will get rid of them. She will spend her entire administration ruining people. That’s what she will do, instead of running the country.”Broaddrick says, “It’s frightening.” Ms. Jones asks, “How can Americans not be frightened about this? How  do they think we’re sitting here, all three of us, and we’re making this stuff up? How can they not be in fear for this woman to run our country and to sit up there and pretend she cares about anybody, much less a female? And that we’re scared for our lives, I mean, basically.”She adds, “Anything could happen, she could do anything or say anything because she’s gotten away with everything. The Clintons have gotten away with everything. Nothing ever sticks to them.” Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake

'Sheriff David Clarke did something that not many are willing to do, particularly the treacherous snakes that have hijacked our nation. They won’t identify the enemy, at least not publicly, and never when it comes to their terrorists allies that should be named. Their true enemy is the American patriot, an identification they undoubtedly make multiple times a day in more private settings.Clarke’s not a coward, he is a man of principle who understands the threats facing this nation. He’s willing to identify the enemy and did so in a Saturday morning tweet. Clarke wrote, “It’s incredible that our institutions of government, White House, Congress, DOJ and big media are corrupt and all we do is bitch. Pitchforks and torches time.”The enemy is clearly defined as is the immediate course of action, a taking to the streets by the American people, the “going Egypt” of the American people all over these corrupt elite, banker-type, liberal, Democrat and Republican establishment pieces of crap.Sheriff Clarke went on Fox and Friends to explain what is needed to those who are looking for some direction and leadership. He’s asked, “You said pitchforks and torches time, what do you mean by that?”Clarke says, “I meant the same thing Frederick Douglass, the abolitionist said when he said that the institution of slavery is a system of brute force and it must be fought with its own weapons. I meant the same thing when Barack Obama in 2008, July of 2008 at a fundraiser and talking about how he would deal with Republicans he said, ‘If they pull a knife we’ll pull a gun.\'”As Steve Doocy nods in what may be subconscious agreement, Clarke continues, saying, “I said the same thing when during the entire summer we had to listen to Bernie Sanders talk about the need for a revolution in America and the leftist media, Fox not included, Fox News, the leftist media had no problem with that.”.@SheriffClarke: It’s time for ‘pitchforks & torches’ in America pic.twitter.com/xpaTWRZGfd— FOX & Friends (@foxandfriends) October 17, 2016Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake

'SHOCKING EVIDENCE: It seems that we may now have an explanation for the nonsensical, bizarre and hostile behavior by both Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan during this campaign season. They seemed to picture themselves as the white knight couple who would ride in to the rescue when all of this rancor and other chaos they were plotting in league with their establishment globalist cohorts unfolded.The problem it seems was once again Donald Trump. He was able to secure the nomination and no matter how hard the subversive tools of the world government tried there was no getting around his grip on the nomination. And they tried very, very hard. They’re still at it as the misconduct of Ryan over this past weekend in the eleventh hour of the election, a time when all disagreements should have been put aside, exploded.Clearly now, the explosion was deliberately set off by the establishment sponsors of the Romney Ryan ticket in the form of an unsuccessful smear attempt through the release of an old video. The feigned outrage of Mitt Romney’s ally in the subterfuge, Utah Senator Mike Lee, as well as that of the vile excrement that occupies the position of Speaker of the House is now clearly coming into focus.They don’t want what’s best for America, a conclusion we reached long ago, based upon their actions, they want what is best for the Chamber of Commerce, for the passage of TPP, for their world government organization and power structure. The fact that all of those interests are at odds with what is best for America never entered into the picture.The scope of this conspiracy will be an interesting revelation as well. We remember the Romney Summit in June in Park City, UT, in which the nevertrump scum was meeting to discuss their way forward. Clearly they had already decided on a path, they just couldn’t let it be known.That is how things work in today’s modern world of criminal, deceptive governments and politicians. The people are always the last to know, by design. Of course we can be certain that the elite media knew, but they’re real good about keeping secrets when the right leaders tell them to.Source FEC.govPlease like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'From the sets of The Kapil Sharma Show, Mumbai: With elections approaching faster now in Punjab, and EC having announced the dates, Everyone finally felt a sigh of relief and expected Sidhu to formally announce the Political outfit which is supposedly going to take Kapil Sharma’s place in his life.On whose joke’s he is going to laugh for next five years? On whose tunes will he dance? In whose favor is he going to say all his strong worded poems?But the wait is getting longer and longer.From the time he left BJP, he has done it all. From announcing a new political outfit, to joining AAP. Then from going independent to joining Congress.Apparently, BJP, also called Bhartiya Jumla Party by its loved ones’, was the party tailor made for Sidhu, with all his one liners, that can also be touted as Jumlas he built to disgrace the party.With polling dates getting announced, curiosity of young India reached  its pinnacle, and everyone was expecting an announcement any day.In a strange turn of events however, it is learnt that Sidhu has requested Election commission to postpone the dates by some tenure, till he decides in on the political party he may join.EC is learnt to have asked for the expected timelines they needed to reschedule the elections.Our reporter Mr. Chatur Khujli also touched base with Mr Navjot singh Sidhu to ask him how much time he needs. “Till The Kapil Sharma show gets over, Thoko Taali”.',fake

'Bengaluru. A software engineer in the city remembers and differentiates between the holidays by the name of the movie seen, his friends told, about one of the many unique idiosyncrasies of an IT guy in the IT capital.OK Jaanu weekend, Raees weekend, Badrinath ki weekend, Baahubali weekend, Tubelight weekend, Secret superstar weekend, Harry met Sejal weekend and Spider weekend – is how he refers to the list of holidays in 2017, whether the holiday falls on a weekend or not, his friends observed. For software engineers, the holidays are greatly reduced to the name of the movie seen, the industry veterans told Faking News.“I am not a movie buff. Movies don’t turn me on. Actually, it is quite opposite. Movies turn me off. During the holidays, I go to a movie and totally turn myself off from the routine hustles and bustles of the work life. Seldom I pay attention to the movie. For example, I never knew when Harry met Sejal or why Tubelight was called a Tubelight when it looked similar to all the other Bhai movies. Failed to watch if Mahesh Babu does any spider man like stunts,” Mahesh told Faking News.“Sometimes, the theme of the weekend gets set along the lines of the movie seen. I am no Harry but I actually met a girl by the name Sejal after the movie. We dated on and off for the next few weekends until the Tubelight weekend. That’s when I finally realised her name was not Sejal and I had been such a Tubelight. And this, you are not going to believe. I actually met my twin brother near to the popcorn stall during the interval of Judwaa 2,” Mahesh further elaborated on how the movies blend with his otherwise boring lifestyle in the traffic challenged city.Faking news reporter left totally awestruck, when Mahesh informed that he is planning to release the 2.0 version of his software during the 2.0 weekend, whenever that actually happens.',fake
'Mumbai. Sony India has launched a new smart camera for Indian market, today. The new camera to support dual sim, the spokesperson for the electronics giant told Faking News. We are the market leaders in the camera market, but never had broken thru the mobile phone market. Now, with the launch of our smart camera, hopefully we would catch best of both the markets, he further added to Faking News.“Worldwide, people find it very cool to be able to take photographs from a mobile phone. Other than serving the primary need of a phone, people would like the device to do too many other things and call it a smart phone. Smart or not, our new camera will have a few more things to do like supporting a dual sim and printing out the photos as soon as they are clicked. No, it is not like Polaroid,” the Sony guy told Faking News.“When you buy a shoe, you just buy a shoe. There is no such thing as a smart shoe with a GPS device to direct you while walking. There are no smart hand gloves with a built-in screen in the palm. No smart caps and thankfully no smart inner-wear. Why do we need smart phones?” Sony guy visibly seemed exasperated with his rhetorical question.“This entire thing about a phone replacing wrist watches, cameras and audio devices is unacceptable. Hell! People aren’t even buying torch lights anymore. And the most devastating of all, no one goes to a park to play anymore! At Sony, we want to bring back the joy of carrying good old camera to all. The only way we can achieve this is by throwing in a couple of SIMs in it,” he smiled triumphantly at Faking News reporter.Before taking leave, our reporter clarified that both the SIMs can be Jio and camera will automatically switch between the two whenever technically needed.',fake
'Yes, it’s official.  The 2016 election season is bringing all sorts of stuff out of the closet and storage thanks to Donald Trump.  Not only has he talked about how crooked Hillary Clinton is, he’s also talked about American elections being rigged.  This charge, of course, is bringing the old guard to the surface to deny the claims all while James O’Keefe’s Project Veritas, and Julian Assange’s Wikileaks are putting out leaks and undercover videos proving that Trump is right.That isn’t stopping Ohio Governor John Kasich from speaking out on the topic, though.  This is the same John Kasich whose Political Action Committee took over $200,000 from a Soros foundation. Via CBS News:“Look, to say that elections are rigged and all these votes are stolen — that’s like saying we never landed on the moon, frankly,” said Kasich. “That’s how silly it is.”The Ohio governor further criticized Trump’s position for sowing paranoia about the integrity of democratic institutions.“I don’t think it’s good for our country, for our democracy, and I don’t believe we have any massive fraud,” Kasich said. “We don’t have that. That’s just a silly argument.”“The problem is it does create doubt in people’s minds and I worry about 25 percent of Americans who may say when the election’s over that it was stolen,” he added. “That is a big, fat joke.”For the millionth time, we in the United States have a representative republic, NOT A DEMOCRACY.  And how Kasich, who is governor of one of the states that is regularly targeted as a “swing” state thus making voter fraud and rigging low hanging fruit for the scheming opportunists of the Democratic machine, can go on national television and deny that it’s happening when proof is popping up like weeds…..Stunning.',fake
'For years now, we conservative Americans have been gnashing our teeth at the amount of money Hungarian-born immigrant and oligarch George Soros has dumped into progressive and purposefully chaotic causes.  Black Lives Matter, blaming police for perps not following orders, muslim immigration both here and in Europe…Hillary Clinton in all shapes, sizes, and forms of physical health.  The old man with all the money is pulling a lot of puppet strings.Word comes via Conservative Outfitters that the old puppetmaster, who is wanted in his country of origin for crimes against humanity, is donating to select Republicans as well as many Democrats.  Records show that the Political Action Committee (PAC) supporting OHIO GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH accepted $202,700 from Soros Fund Management. Well, isn’t that special.  Soros strikes again.It also explains a few things given the size of the donation:And yet more of Kasich’s support to other aspects of the progressive agenda.Angry Patriot, a resident of Ohio, had this to say about Kasich, dubbed the “absentee governor” by Republican Presidential Candidate Donald Trump.John Kasich is fond of claiming he is the “only adult on the stage” and disparaging Donald Trump and his dedicated supporters. The governor will find out just how out of touch he is with his own constituents after the polls close tomorrow evening.All of his lofty talk about being dedicated to the protect “the least of us” is an outright lie. In Ohio, the people who fit in that exact category have not seen Kasich since an extremely brief campaign stop when he first ran for office.I live in the poorest region of Ohio. We have not experienced ANY of the job growth he constantly brags about during debates. We have trained and educated workers, near zero crime, good roads, and broadband Internet.What we don’t have are jobs, a grocery store, a hospital, or a single place where mothers can buy baby food or formula for their babies.Our county commissioners would bend over backwards to have a chance at some of the jobs created by companies Kasich enticed to Ohio. We can’t even score temporary jobs for skilled workers when state road work and other projects reach into our rural area. Because of all the big government red tape and union rules, those high-paying jobs go to crews from the city who constantly get lost when they come to the job sites. Kasich promised to change that during his first campaign – he never even tried.Donald Trump was right when calling Kasich an absentee governor. If he had enough time to leave Columbus to be on the campaign trail for months, he definitely had the time, over the past eight years, to visit each of the 88 counties in our fine state at least once. He did n0t.Thus putting John Kasich in the category of the globalist oligarchy water boy.  Thank Heaven he flamed out at the presidential level.',fake
'Some years ago now, on a Monday morning, a huge merger between two titans of entertainment was announced out of the blue.  Disney and ABC were joining forces.  This came as a gigantic shock to absolutely everyone in business and entertainment.  Why?  Because no one had caught one whiff of what was happening in the rumor mill or grapevine.  The people who negotiated the merger had kept it quiet, basically by not using the airwaves, or cell phones. (Email wasn’t as big a thing then, but it was avoided, too.)  Negotiations were done over coffee and the details spelled out on napkins, not Word documents, until it was all over.That particular business deal should be one of the great lessons learned in modern communication: if you want to keep something secret, talk in person or on landlines, put information on paper, and never, ever, mention the topic on a mobile phone or in email.  It’s too easily intercepted.  (This is why no one should ever put their Social Security Number or Credit Card Information into a form on the internet without being on a secure server.)One would think the “smart people” of government would get that.  Apparently not.For the last week, we of the online armies have been wading through an email cache that all went through a single email address, [email protected], and was obtained by Wikileaks. (When dealing with bombshell information, it’s always best not to ask too many questions about how it was acquired.)  John Podesta, currently, is Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager.  For decades, though, he’s been known as the political “fixer” of the Clinton machine.Podesta is not at all a dumb man.  Not even.  He’s ruthless, and takes no prisoners, but in no way is he without wits.  Which makes a handful of observations about the messaging confounding.First off, many of us out here have used the gmail hub option to manage multiple email accounts.  This writer at one time had four accounts all hooked into a main gmail address.  It’s amazingly convenient, and does assure that one is constantly connected to smart devices.  For information shared and needed for CYA purposes, having the date and time stamp on an email or message is invaluable.  However, for communications on sensitive stuff – say terminating an employee – that was usually kept off that avenue.  Paper was passed around, and discussion via landline was preferred.There is also a certain advantage in real time communications.  This is why email was invented after all – for the battlefield.  However, when sensitive information can be tracked, and hacked, it’s time to rethink using that specific method.And then there’s the matter of gmail, a product of Google, itself.  After the Edward Snowden revelations, and knowing just how much information the government can vacuum up thanks to back doors and meta data spying programs, many of us quit using the medium – and all other social media – for controversial or blackmail eligible information.  Podesta, it seems, didn’t.  Google is just as hackable as any of the other big named systems.  Using a gmail account as a hub is almost an open invitation.In going through the emails available so far, Podesta talks about hooking into Amtrak’s public wifi which seemed to mess up his system.  If he’s hooking into an unsecured network like Amtrak’s, why would he not hook into others?Stolen or not, the judgement – or lack of it – displayed in having all this sensitive information on an email account that does not go through a secure and dedicated server is questionable at best.  Did Mr. Podesta think he would not be a target simply because he doesn’t work directly for government?  Just being part of the Clinton machine puts scrutiny on a person, justified or not.  Maintaining channels of communication with an eye on possibly being intercepted should be top of mind.  No one is interested in the fundraising emails, or the test communications that are already approved…it’s approval process that’s of interest.  How the people are being manipulated with language and emotion laden words that all of us who took public relations know how to inject in our messaging.  That is the sort of thing that is most revealing.  Other than the possibility of a Supreme Court Justice being assassinated, of course.To answer the CNN reporter who said that the Podesta emails were stolen, and it is illegal to be in possession of them…the genie is out of the bottle.  There’s no putting it back.  Illegal or not, We the People are getting a glimpse into the wider world of the Clinton Machine and one of the people charged with running it.  If Podesta had been more careful in his email practices, that may not have happened.',fake

'One would think the faculty at Yale would be trying to actually forge adults out of the special snowflakes in their care.  Alas, no such luck.  On Wednesday, November 9, the day after Hillary Clinton lost her bid for the presidency, a number of Econ 115 students contacted the professor with tales of depression, woe, and other symptoms of mourning.  The professor, unidentified at the time of this writing, in tern made a midterm exam optional.No, this is not a joke.  The special snowflakes appealed to the compassion of the individual and he or she did something the nuns at this writer’s high school never would have done.  To wit: Yep, that is correct.  The mid-term exam is optional. At least for this class.  The biology midterm, on the other hand, is still on.The students cite the “emotional toll” of an election for which the consequences cannot possibly be realized by all of them if they think that this is an occasion to actually beg out of a midterm exam.  Seriously, what kind of kids are being raised by Americans?  Certainly not adults with well established emotional stability.  Not even.This incident at Yale is just one of many reported across the United States on the day after Hillary Clinton was denied re-entry into public office.  With the number of criminal implications and actual pieces of evidence surfacing thanks to patriots within the U.S. government, mature voters who think with their heads and not their hearts or lady parts basically saved the country for a little longer.  The special snowflakes don’t get that.  In fact, they got exactly what they should not have gotten: more cossetting.',fake
'BANGALORE (THE REAL FAKE NEWS)- Unable to explain how this kept happening, 2nd year student Avanti Sharma says that every time she goes presses  the letter ‘F’ into her Google Chrome browser, she would wake up 4-6 hours later, sitting at the same spot, with no memory of the previous few hours.“With the start of the new trimester, I was interested to start looking into the project topics I’d been given for my courses. Like all students, I always submit well-researched, original projects on time. However, every time I went to my Chrome browser to begin research by Googling a topic, through some dark magic my hand would shift over and press the ‘F’ key, and then the Enter key, and from that point on it’s all a blank” she recalled, horrified.She went to her doctor, but the doctor started giving her a lecture about ‘kids these days’ and her eyes glazed over and she didn’t listen. At one point, she even considered switching over from Chrome to Microsoft Edge, but after a few deep breaths calmed herself down, saying “there’s no need to go completely crazy”. She still hasn’t been able to find a solution to the problem, but in the meantime, has reportedly enjoyed a lot of dank memes.At press time, an eerie, evil laughter could be heard in the background, and was later found out to be Mark Zuckerberg, who has been hiding in the college’s big server, last updated in 1991.',fake
'It took 20 email cache releases from WikiLeaks and some tenacious digging from internet users everywhere (THANK YOU REDDIT), but the American Mainstream Media FINALLY started reporting on the elephant in the room of the John Podesta emails.  That would be the money flowing into the Clinton Foundation from all over the globe while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State.In fact, the excrement hit the fan so hard, that even the wackadoodles at MSNBC’s Morning Joe took notice.Side note: Mika, lose the plaid. Stick with the classics, please.Think about it, 10 days from the election, and this story hits the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post – the major dailies – ABOVE THE FOLD.  (Visit this site for the front covers of 16 American newspapers today.) By journalistic standards, this is YUGE.  There is no ignoring it anymore.  The moral and ethical challenges and deficits of the Clintons and the way they ran the “foundation” are out in the open for all to see, not just clear to the people who dig deep on the internet.Why it took Chelsea Clinton to recognize this as a problem, and get the ball rolling to maybe clean things up at least for appearances sake, is a question that needs to be answered.  A few days ago, there were reports about her “brattiness.” More than one outlet finally got to the bottom of the story in that she knew the Foundation scandal would be an obstacle to her mother being president.Well, guess what.  The brat was right.  The mainstream media FINALLY was forced to report on the story of just what the Clinton Foundation really is all about. Most of the outlets haven’t said it outright, but if it walks, talks and smells like a pay to play laundering scheme, it probably is.Ron Fournier, a fairly honest liberal, has been harping on the “follow the money” angle for over a year.  The mainstream media is finally doing that. “Blurred lines” is mild for what has been going on with the Clinton Foundation.  Eddie Glaude, Jr., in the second video is absolutely correct.  It stinks.P.s.

'Not that the viewers of cop shows for the last decade didn’t know this, but United States law enforcement shares resources.  Especially when identification is needed, the “good guys with the guns” look through all sorts of databases for pictures of Americans looking for a match.  Mug shots, driver’s licenses, internet…our faces are everywhere, and the government can find out if your face is in any picture, anytime if your face is already in one of these databases.A study conducted by Georgetown Law’s Center on Privacy and Technology found that while the system does not sit with any one law enforcement entity, the information sharing has the effect of half of the country being in the system.“Looking at the sum total of what we found, there have been no laws that comprehensively regulate face recognition technology, and there’s really no case law either,” Clare Garvie, an associate at the CPT, told Vocativ. “So we find ourselves having to rely on the agencies that are using that technology to rein it in. But what we found is that not every system — by a long shot — has a use policy.”Meaning that with no laws governing the system as it stands, the entire network is open to abuse regardless of its usefulness in fighting crime and finding criminals.That so many American adults are in at least one facial recognition database is largely due to the fact that at least 26 states, and likely more, share their Department of Motor Vehicles databases with the FBI, state police, or other law enforcement agencies, the study found. Compounded with that, police often have access to mugshot databases. Garvie’s study found that most law enforcement agencies don’t purge such records, even if the arrested suspect is found not guilty, unless a court orders it. The sole known exception is the Michigan State Police, which does expunge photos after a set amount of time….“These systems are used on law-abiding Americans without their knowledge or consent in most cases,” Garvie said.How that fits into a law and order society has yet to be determined.  The law has not caught up to technology in this case. According to the study, a full quarter of law enforcement agencies in the United States have access to the system with a facial recognition center that has software to help them out.The West Virginia Fusion Center, for example, a Charleston-based coalition of federal and local law enforcement, possesses software that matches individuals in video footage with a database of still photographs. Not only does it share information with the FBI, West Virginia State Police, and city and county departments, it may grant access to 77 other fusion centers across the country.In a country where privacy is supposedly assured, law and order is a way of life, and search and seizure is supposed to be done only via warrant, this is terrifying.  Who knows how such information and ability can be used and abused by authorities. And the source material isn’t social media so much as official government records.From the Voactiv.com piece:',fake
'Mumbai: From the latest TRP ratings published, one unusual observation has come to our notice. If we add the TRPs claimed by different TV channels for a particular time slot, it is going more than 200 percent which is baffling to say the least.“First thing most of the TV channels will say they do not believe in these TRP data, then they threaten to boycott it from next time. However, after one channel starts putting advertisement how they topped in certain prime hour duration, others follow,” said media observer R. Shankar while speaking to us.“I took prime time duration 8 PM to 10 PM time slot for my analysis. Added the TRPs claimed by the news channels. It is 218 percent. How on earth this is possible?” said Mr. Shankar who decided to meet the heads of this channel before exposing this farce. After meeting the TV channel heads Mr. Shankar got a clue how these TV channels present the data to its advantage. “Though Rating was given for hour basis, TV channels claim they collect data per every second. So, what happens is they extract the best data and present it in a way to claim how they are on top. Of course, if I look data for a particular second and add them, the sum total comes cent percent,” said Mr. Shankar on the realities behind TRP business.When Shankar questioned them saying this is not fair. TV channel heads told me as per the guidelines they put * marks with disclaimer below which people should try to read. For that to do you need to pause your TV which should be of 102 inch or above. The recommended font size for disclaimers is 5 or below.We noticed a TV channel which showed only advertisement during a particular time period, claims in that period maximum people watched its hard-hitting debate show it conducts.

'A survey conducted by the students of California University and Gopalchand Deemed University suggests that a majority of youngsters now use festival greetings as an excuse either to break the ice or re-initiate talks with their crushes and exes respectively.India is a land of festivals, and that’s one of the reasons India has the ideology of Vasudev Kutumbakam, because relatives keep coming to stay together, making the whole world, one home.These festivals not only bring relatives, but also bring smiles on people’s face for various reasons. People wait for their special festival whole year. Time has changed now people wait for festivals for their personal reasons too. After shopkeepers and shopping websites, if there is anyone who wait eagerly for these festivals- it’s the people who want to reconnect with their Exes.A recent survey conducted after Diwali confirms that people wait for festivals in order to talk to their crushes and exes. Raghu Chandra (changed name) of Bengaluru said, “Me and my girlfriend were not on talking terms since 3 months, but as Diwali came I sent her a Diwali forward and she responded with the same. We laughed it out and start talking again! All thanks to Diwali.”Manoj Malhotra of Delhi too confirmed this, He said, “I am an engineer and I am in love with my colleague, Anshita (name changed) since many years. Though never mustered up the courage to tell her. She never replies to engineers so only way I can get her reply is by wishing her on Diwali, New Year, Holi, her birthday or getting wished by her on my birthday.”“Manoj’s desperation to get a reply from Anshita is so high that he once mistakenly wished her Happy Muhrram after which she block Manoj on WhatsApp,” told his friend Ashwin.It’s surprising that in today’s world of artificial intelligence people still want replies from human beings.

'Now that the Electoral College is showing a Donald Trump “upset” that those of us in flyover country knew was coming, bigger news is not being reported.  Liberals everywhere are in mourning.  Having a Republican in the White House is great and all, and will take care of all of Barack Obama’s illegal executive orders, but even more threatening to the Occupier’s liberal legacy: on Tuesday, the American people voted for a Republican House and Senate with a Republican president for the first time since 1928.  Look at the bottom of the graphic.The votes will be close, and they will be met with derision and disdain, but say good-bye to excessive coal regulations, Obamacare, taxes at confiscation levels, attempts at gun control, and the mass importation of illegal immigrants.THAT is the real threat to liberals and the liberal agenda.  With a Republican Congress, Trump’s platform has a much better chance of becoming a reality.This, of course, depends on leadership in Congress doing THEIR jobs and not just whining about not having a president to sign legislation.  They have to pass it again.  Both Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell remained on the sidelines of the Trump Train, but gave lip service to their support for the Trump agenda following the presidential victory on November 8.Early on Wednesday, shortly after Clinton conceded to Trump, Ryan said in a statement: “We are eager to work hand-in-hand with the new administration to advance an agenda to improve the lives of the American people.”Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, also a Republican, said in a guarded and similarly timed statement: “The American people have chosen a new direction for our nation.”The American people have spoken.  It is in the best interest of the critters in Congress to listen.  The billionaires may do all the lobbying, but We the People hold the ultimate power of the vote.',fake

The difficulty for viewers to fast for even a couple of hours will make them respect and salute this hero, who has fasted for days together against corruption, awakening an entire complacent generation, all the more. With his one-time protege Arvind Kejriwal also reviewing hazaar movies, but shamelessly keeping away from one dedicated to Hazare, this is the least we could do to honor Annaji,” a theatre owner from Ralegaon Siddhi told The UnReal Times.Former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister and Thiru M Karunanidhi was the first to laud the decision. “Going on a fast unto death in between breakfast and lunch is no big deal for me paa, so I can easily watch the morning show. If there is a Tamil dubbing of this movie running in Chennai, I’d love to watch it. Let me ask Stalin. But I’m very happy with the theatre owners decision, so I hereby announce a mixer-grinder free for each theatre owner following this rule as well as one for Anna thambi himself,” the DMK patriarch stated.Multiplexes, have, however, refrained from complying with the rule. “It really doesn’t make a difference. Given how pricey our popcorn and nachos are, people, as it is, don’t really buy anything from us and prefer to drink even water from the sinks and purifiers, rather than shelling a bomb for mineral water. So we’re pretty indifferent about this,” a multiplex owner said.While the Aam Aadmi Party and its workers are yet to comment on the development, the BJP strongly criticized the association for such a rule. “What next? For a biopic on Arivnd Kejriwal, will theaters have seats with raita spilled on them?” BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra thundered squealed in a press conference. Meanwhile, high drama and tension prevailed at a theater in Mumbai after NCP supremo Sharad Pawar fainted while watching the movie, having not been provided with water. “Only once?” asked a smiling Anna Hazare, on hearing the news.',fake
'It was a proud moment for the scientists at Indian Science Organisation, when last Saturday, they finally put final nail in the coffin to their ongoing research, which was based on the number of engineers in India. The infamous theory of ‘In India, if you throw a stone, it will hit an engineer’ has been put to rest after Indian scientists finally proved it right.We interviewed Mr. Deepak Ahluwalia, Head of Indian Science Organisation and here’s what he had to say “Since many years, we have been hearing the phrase that in our country, if you throw a stone, it will hit an engineer. Ever since I was a student, I wanted to know the rationale behind this statement. Even though I myself am an engineer, I needed some concrete proof to prove this theory.So I formed a team of 11 members (all engineers) including myself. The fact that finding them wasn’t difficult gave me hopes that I can pull off this experiment successfully.” Speaking more about the experiment, he added “So we decided to carry out the experiment on a random street in Mumbai. We chose one in Dadar. We set up cameras and mikes, got 2 stone-throwing slingshots and began our experiment. Using the slingshots, 2 of our team members, who are also state level archers, threw stones at 10 random people walking on the street. Each time, it hit a person, our team used to go there, stop the person, ask about their graduation and return after getting slapped for throwing stones. And to our surprise and delight, all 10 of them were engineers and all 10 of them slapped our team members. We had pulled off the experiment successfully and we had the proof on camera. We finally did it!”It is indeed a proud moment for our scientists and we hope they unravel more such theories soon.',fake
'The Secret Service and the FBI are about to be really busy.  In the days since November 8, when Donald Trump took more than the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency, the people who have gotten into anarchy as a bargaining chip have been looting, rioting, protesting, defacing property and setting fire to the very locales who actually voted FOR his opponent Hillary Clinton.  In addition to the mayhem, the anti-Trump contingent of the Democratic chaos machine has come up with an oh so clever Twitter hashtag that includes a death threat.Can you say federal crime? As if that wasn’t bad enough, seeing as how assassination threats are illegal and taken quite seriously by the people who are charged with protecting the president, the reality that Twitter is allowing this to be shared makes this writer embarrassed to be from the same hometown as the platform’s founder.Nicole Mainor, a spokesperson for the Secret Service, declined to comment on the posts directly, citing agency policy.“The Secret Service does not provide information regarding protective services,” Mainor said.But a security source told The Post that the Secret Service would investigate all social media postings containing credible threats, adding that there’s a difference between someone saying they’re planning to kill the president and suggesting that someone else should attempt an assassination. Generally, indirect threats are not prosecuted, according to the source, and investigators will “prioritize” them before determining their credibility.FBI officials declined comment, referring inquiries to the Secret Service.Considering that any mention of Barack Obama farting was scrubbed from the internet for “cause,” the call for killing a man really should be taken a lot more seriously by the platforms doing the censoring.  No, not everyone is going to like Donald Trump being elected president of the United States.  Many of us out here on the fruited plain didn’t like Barack Obama being elected.  We may have protested, but we did not resort to violence.  Death threats to the man were taken seriously, as they should have been, and were scrubbed from the internet.',fake
'Political theater and gaslighting being what it is, one poll from the Benson Strategy Group for the Clinton Foundation may just be a $100 dragged through a trailer park, but it is compelling none the less.  See, contrary to what the professional pollsters with all the “scientific methods” are telling us, according to data in a seven page report labeled “Do Not Distribute, Do Not Copy” Donald Trump is leading Hillary Clinton 77\% to 19\%.  Any way a reader looks at it, those are landslide numbers.From the Executive Summary:Interviews with 2,021 adult Americans conducted by telephone by BSG on October 10-13, 2016. The margin of sampling error for results based on the total sample is plus or minus 2 percentage points. The sample uses a LVS based on voting history (65\%), self-attestation (12\%), social-media data mining (10\%), demographic / socio-economic class (18\%). This sample includes 1101 interviews among landline respondents and 920 interviews among cell phone respondents.NO SKEWS OR NARRATIVE SCREENS WERE EMPLOYEDThat means, that unlike the “scientific polls,” this one is not weighted or tilted one way or another to give a predetermined result.  Quite the contrary.  The data sample is larger and includes both landlines and mobile.  Official polls generally only use land lines.  The simple results in this poll are:62\% of people are claiming to be voting for Trump and their minds are made up – and that number has momentum, something else the people at Benson Strategy Group noted.At this point Donald Trump has both momentum and enthusiasm. Distrust in the mainstream media is blunting the impact of the collective polling narrative. As Election Day approaches, Hillary Clinton’s favorable ratings have crashed to historic lows (12\%) in nonpartisans and Donald Trump is consolidating support (97\% of LV Republican-identifying respondents are either enthusiastic or very enthusiastic about voting for Trump).Also of note:Among independents, Hillary voters who are exposed to any alternative media (73\%) are aware of the WikiLeaks emails and find them either disturbing (54\%) or deeply disturbing (18\%). Among liberal-identifying whites, support is shifting from Hillary (-27 since October 1st) to Donald Trump (78\%) or Jill Stein (21\%).As for what to do come election day should Hillary need a little help, these operations are NOT RECOMMENDED:Yes, it seems the Project Vertias warnings were not out of line.For the full report, follow this link before it disappears.  Hopefully, the anonymous source survives.Like all things politics, this could be a red herring, or it could be why We the People are being gaslighted with no end in sight.H/T – daisyluther.com (as of this writing, the page disappeared)',fake
'Normally the corrupt Democrats will bus in some union groups or paid actors pretending to be Clinton supporters to fill the seats and stands. They at least attempt to make it a little less obvious that nobody outside of the elites, Hollywood, entertainers, financial parasites, globalists and establishment hierarchy supports their criminal ticket. Somebody within the campaign apparently messed up. It was this past Monday, so at a minimum the unions should have been able to get their unprincipled minions over to affirm their undying love and support for the evil one or her running mate. What happened?At what point does a rally become something else, like just a few guys hanging out or “chillin with the freak?” While Kaine is undoubtedly not the kind of guy you’d give a spare house key to and tell to “drop in anytime,” they are supposed to be able to tolerate him at least for the duration of a campaign speech.Beyond mere tolerance, is there an enthusiasm requirement for a designation of a gathering as a rally or is the presence of a finite number of bodies in possession of a pulse sufficient? By these standards my last visit to DMV was  “rousing” and “electric.”You know your campaign is in trouble when Kaine, the man designated to be president when Clinton finally can’t hide her health any longer or drops dead can only draw about thirty people to an event. Security is unsurpassed for this West Palm Beach, FL, event, as the ratio of Secret Service agents to attendees appears to be about four to one. It might even be better than that as some of those attendees are likely plain clothes officers as well. For all we know there were no attendees, only Kaine, his promoters and his protectors.It’s much more than he needs in the way of security. With his party being the one that conducts the dirty tricks and thuggery and no civilians even aware of his existence, he’s not in any danger. It’s okay, though, the Clintons’ have plenty of other people’s money to throw away on security and everything else, including bribes and lots of false, negative ads.Clearly that isn’t enough. The American people seem to have figured out their scam. They’ve got something better to do than stand around and be lied to by weird little elf people. You’d expect to see more people than this at a typical five-year-old’s birthday party.BREAKING: #TimKaine rally only about 30 people show up.

'BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra has shifted to the Republic TV office situated in Lower Parel to save his time spent travelling to the studio for the debate every night.Earlier this month, Sambit had requested Republic TV editor-in-chief, Arnab Goswami, to allot him some space in the office premises so that he can shift there permanently along with his family members.Confirming the news, Sambit said, “It took me a lot of time and effort to travel to Republic TV studio for the debate every day. Arnab and I belong to the same party… oops! I mean, we go to a lot of parties together. So, he had to do me a favour by giving me and my family some space in his office. After all, I have been the most consistent thing on the debate after the noise.” He further added that Arnab has stood by him like a rock, “This is not the first time that Arnab has helped me. Many a times on the debate, he speaks exactly what I intend to, which reduces my responsibilities as a spokesperson of the BJP,” he said, thanking Arnab. Meanwhile, the spokespersons of the Congress party who had allegedly boycotted the Republic TV debates were seen queuing outside the news channel’s office. One of the spokespersons said, “With the high rates of property in Mumbai, it is really difficult to find an appropriate house in the city. We are ready to appear in Republic TV debates again if Arnab allows us to stay in his office like he allowed Sambit,” he said. He clarified that he will not be bringing his family along with him to the office. “My son has frequent exams in his school. Given the high decibels in Republic TV studio, my son will not be able to concentrate in studies,” he said.Arnab confirmed the news when our reporter spoke to him: “IT’S TRUE. I CAN’T REALLY EXPRESS MY EXCITEMENT TO HAVE SAMBIT ONBOARD. THIS IS THE BEST THING THAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME SINCE 2014 AFTER MODI JI’S VICTORY,” he shouted. ',fake
'4th Nov,2017. After the derailment of trains, another case of carelessness from Indian Railways has come to light. A defective tomato sachet caused havoc in the life of a 26-year old girl, Sukriti, going to her home. When Sukriti got seated in chair car bogie of Malpua Express, she had no idea of what is going to happen in this journey.Sukriti received morning tea around 7 am in the morning, moments after she got seated. After about an hour, she got her breakfast. Please note that we have been giving Rajdhani and Shatabdi trains, an extra penny for this meal since decades. After finishing the breakfast, unable to make space for the sauce in her stomach, Sukriti decided to put that sachet in her bag where all other sachets have been stored from previous visits at various places.What happened thereafter, will blow your mind and make you cry. Keep tissues handy. After about an hour, when she opened the bag for putting another sachet of jam to store at the same place, she found leaked sauce scattered all over her bag. It took a good 30 minutes before she could restore back the situation.Such incidents show the carelessness of Indian Railways and also highlight the plight of passengers .Railway authorities should take this matter into serious hands, before it impacts the life of another Sukriti.',fake
'Tomi Lahren reminds Americans that it is very important that they vote. She reiterates she’s addressing Americans and explains that she isn’t speaking to either dead people or invaders who barged into this country illegally. She notes that while they are accustomed to having their butts wiped by Obama and Hillary Clinton, that special treatment doesn’t include the right to vote.She points out the Democrat fraud, they are the party of criminals, after all, includes 2.8 million who are registered to vote in two or more states and 1.8 million who, although they are registered to vote, are actually deceased.Lahren points out that in 2008 over six percent of non-citizens were able to vote, a number which was the difference in getting their current fellow illegal squatter elected. She advocates for voter ID laws although there is obviously not enough time at this late stage in the game for us to do much beyond some intensive poll watching and the associated challenges.DHS Secretary and illegal alien enabler Jihadi Jeh Johnson has been promoting the idea that the election will be hacked so there’s little doubt the Democrats have something in the works, some form of illegality to put their criminal into office, likely an assortment of attacks across not only polling sites but elsewhere.She reminds us of the ludicrous arguments of the left against protecting the integrity of the electoral process, the claims that voter ID laws “disenfranchise voters and hamper the minority vote. She asks the question many of us have given up trying to get an answer to because their simply is none, saying, “I still don’t get how showing a driver’s license or ID card to vote is in any way racist or exclusionary.”Ms. Lahren says, “If you need an ID to buy Sudafed, get into a bar, cash a check or board an airplane, you sure as hell need one to vote for our next president. This is common sense and if the Dems don’t like that, well, that tells you everything you need to know about that party.”She mentions that the IDs are also free for those who can’t afford one, asking, “Since when have Democrat voters ever had a hard time accepting a free thing. Lahren adds, “This war against voter ID laws is nothing more than a continuation of the left’s favorite narrative, everyone is a victim and law and order is oppressive.

'Tomi Lahren Schools Americas Journalist: Tomi Lahren says “Thank goodness for WikiLeaks, because these sorry excuses for ‘journalism’ in the mainstream are enough to make us all turn off the television.” She asks a rhetorical question to Democrats about whether they want to win fair and square, in what sounds like a rare moment of naiveté for her. Of course she knows that Democrats don’t care how they win. They’ll do anything to win, a lesson comrade Sanders learned the hard way. They’re cheating in every way imaginable to win at this very moment.After noting her biggest supporters, which includes the propagandists in prominent positions, and how they used longtime Clinton insider George Stephanopoulos, for one, as a mouthpiece.She notes that Trump’s victory in the second debate didn’t happen as far as the coverage in the propaganda outlets is concerned. She notes the double standard in all the hair-pulling and hand-wringing of the media as they bleat incessantly about the Trump video, yet they refuse to acknowledge the Clinton sexual improprieties and assaults, the blood on Clinton’s hands for four Americans she killed in Benghazi, her destruction of evidence in the deletion of 33,000 emails after having received a subpoena, or the racketeering at the pay to play Clinton Foundation.Lahren says Trump was right, that it was three on one at the debate and asks, “How does it feel that he beat all of you?” Lahren takes exception to the inevitable claims that Trump was too aggressive with the evil troll, saying, “Well if the moderators had asked her about Benghazi we wouldn’t have to. If the moderators would ask her why she deleted 33,000 emails we wouldn’t have to. If the moderators would ask her why she laughed about getting a rapist off the hook he wouldn’t have to. If the moderators would ask her about her repeated lies he wouldn’t have to. If the moderators would ask her about pimping out the State Department for her foundation, he wouldn’t have to. Are you getting the pattern here?”She adds, “When Ken Bone does a better job of asking questions than seasoned, high paid television ‘journalists,’ you know how little you can trust their motivations.

'Now it’s official. If you don’t admire emperor Obama’s new clothes, his “Air, Dir, and Water Nazi,” Gina McCarthy, has decided you no longer are worthy of her time. According to her the discussion is finished, her side won, the fairy tale is real and those who insist on living in the real world, alarmism deniers, have now ceased to exist. Her boss, Hussein Obama has empowered the little witch through his own declaration that the “science” is settled.The EPA troll announced in a Facebook interview with Mashable on Tuesday, that she’s done talking to “climate deniers,” displaying the typical open-mindedness that is so characteristic of the global government shills.In falsely presenting her case as being grounded in reason,  McCarthy said, “If they haven’t figured out by now, what in God’s name could anyone say to them?” Conversely, one could ask the same questions of the dirt worshipers.She continued, “I don’t check out flat Earth society and I’m not talking to climate deniers. That’s it. Sorry, I know I’m supposed to be for everybody, but my patience has worn thin over eight years.”Actually, McCarthy, nobody has ever accused an EPA chief of being for anybody other than the Democrat NWO, so don’t worry your manly little head over it. Nobody has ever gotten a straight or honest answer from this manipulative subversive either, though she’s had eight years of non-stop attacks on the American people and our nation in which to offer one. We’re paying tax dollars to be dictated to, demeaned and have our country destroyed in the name of complete and utter lies, nonsense, idiocy and corruption. She thinks she’s lost her patience?She attempts to defend her agency’s war on coal, and the economic disasters that they have inflicted upon ordinary Americans. Although it’s something that Hussein Obama announced prior to his taking the office he now holds, McCarthy said, “This is not something that happened over the past administration.” While the Bush and Clinton administrations were no friends of the American people, to say that the damage has not increased exponentially under her and Obama would be a false statement on par with equating erosion with the the mythical rising sea levels.The Daily Caller notes that in a June 2015 speech, McCarthy stated that, “normal people,” not global warming skeptics, would win the climate debate. Of course normal people and global warming skeptics are one in the same. In fairness to McCarthy, she probably only associates herself with other Democrats and complicit establishment Republicans. It’s hard to recognize a normal person when all you have is EPA sycophants as your points of reference.In that speech she also stated, “I am doing that not to push back on climate deniers. (the normal folks) You can have fun doing that if you want, but I’ve batted my head against the wall too many times and if the science already hasn’t changed their mind it never will.”The evidence of that “head batting” has been manifesting itself with increased frequency in the policies of the regime since they first hit town, in 2009.

'In a daredevil operation, Mumbai Police has evacuated Times Now building where a few panelists were trapped for the past several years and were subjected to inhuman torture. The operation lasted for an hour, and it was carried out only after the editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami formally resigned and left the premise.Human rights activists have long been highlighting the atrocities carried out inside the office at 9 PM every night and expressing concern about the safety of the panelists, but the police were avoiding a direct face off with the editor-in-chief.Once a brave cop tried to enter the office last year but was apprehended by Mr. Goswami who pulled him inside the news room, screaming, “Let’s play debate-debate game,” and forced him to respond to a statement made by the commissioner of police he was working under. The incident transformed his life completely. He quit his job as a cop and devoted his life to the nation, fighting corruption, questioning the system, and reforming society… on Twitter. Legend has it that at 9 PM every night, he becomes a ghost and retweets every tweet shared with the hashtag provided by Times Now.Since then, no other policeman could muster up the courage to enter the premise in Mr. Goswami’s presence and they were waiting for this day when they could rescue the panelists without having to explain anyone why they exist on earth. And the day finally arrived last night.Happiness and freedom wafted in the air as the panelists reunited with their family members outside Times Now’s office.We spoke to one of the panelists and asked him, “How does it feel to be free again?”“Is it really happening?” his eyes sparkled in joy as he replied, but he quickly regained his composure and continued in a hushed tone, “Oh, I am sorry.”“No, it’s ok. You can smile,” we reassured him.“Really! Can I smile again?”“Yes, you can. Now tell us about your experience inside.”“Can I complete a sentence, like a full sentence without anyone stopping me in between and interpreting my half statement the way he wants?”“No, no one is going to stop you. Please share your thoughts.”He choked as he tried to speak. Words escaped him as he looked over his shoulder at Times Now’s building with harrowing memories flashing through his mind, a scenario reminiscent of the concluding part of a science fiction movie where the hero takes stock of the carnage wrecked by the dinosaur throughout the movie.As we bade goodbye to him, we noticed thousands of visitors coming in to have a glimpse of the office. There were birds chirping happily on top of the building without anyone interrupting them. There were people walking fearlessly on the roads. There were liberals contemplating on celebrating 1st November as independence day while standing alarmingly close to the office building.

'Conservative activist Trevor Loudon was a guest on “Breitbart News Daily” Monday morning, offering the ominous prediction of what will result if Hillary Clinton is allowed to take possession of the White House. Whether she actually gets a higher vote count or not, whether she is placed into office by the elites through fraud, it won’t matter.This will effectively be our last election. She’s already promised that within the first 100 days she intends to make the illegals citizens through some hook or crook form of executive dictatorial action. It will be the corrupt Democrat state controlling everything from that point on, with nothing, not even a facade of an opposition party to stand in her way.Trevor Loudon informs the audience that “Hillary Clinton is intimately involved in UN resolution 1618, which has been promoted by the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the world’s largest NGO, which is controlled by the Muslim Brotherhood. That resolution criminalizes criticism of Islam worldwide, including the United States. That will directly go against your First Amendment.” What he doesn’t say specifically is that it will also be a huge step in the direction of the imposition of Sharia Law in the North American Caliphate.“She’ll obviously use the Supreme Court to shut down the First and Second Amendment.” He continues, saying, “I just want to make one big point. She has promised within 100 days of assuming office to legalize all of the illegal immigrants in the United States. Now that’s anywhere between 12 and 50 million people. We know from past patterns that they will vote between 75 and 80 percent Democrat. If she does that there will never be another Republican president, ever or anyone other than a Democrat. You’ll have effectively a one party state in America.”Loudon warns, “Now if you think Obama was a totalitarian, you imagine Hillary Clinton with no effective Republican opposition ever. She will just go hardcore to strip all of your rights. Hillary Clinton is an ideological Marxist. People have to understand that. She’s worked with the communist movement her entire life. She works extensively with the Muslim Brotherhood.” He points also to her subversive actions with the Russians, those same people she and Obama are supposedly at war with, the ones she sold our Uranium to.He asks how the nevertrump traitors will rebuild the conservative movement after sitting out the current election when they’ve put someone in power that will flood the nation with Democrats.

'Under normal circumstances, this writer would be reluctant to post a forty-six minute video of any sort, but we live in extra-ordinary times, and today, Donald Trump put on a clinic in how to fight back when libeled by one of the American major dailies.The “story” (face it, Dems, libs, progressives and feminists, it was a fairy tale – and a fractured one at that) hit the New York Times on the evening of Wednesday, October 12.  Supposedly, Donald Trump misbehaved sexually on a long flight and in the first class cabin.  Several members of the flying public debunked the details, and Trump himself immediately demanded a retraction with the threat of legal action.  Other women who have come in contact with Trump now are alleging similar misconduct.In today’s speech in West Palm Beach, Florida, a visibly furious Donald Trump took these people, and their tactics, apart.  Noting that none of these women ever presses charges or complained about any of the “misconduct” before now, The Donald defended himself in a way that had the crowd cheering him on.One report this writer read claims that Trump fumed all night.  Being an opera singer, I am here to tell you that in exhaustion, and fury, the first thing to go is the voice.  In the video below, Trump’s voice is showing evidence that he was up all night.  It’s tired.  But, he can’t give up.  There’s too much at stake.After about twenty minutes, Trump tacks to actual policy and the Clinton/Obama record on foreign policy among other topics, but when it comes down to it, when he says that the great editors and founders of the New York Times and other publications have to be spinning in their graves at the scandalous activities done by reporters both in plain sight and as revealed by a whole lot of leaked John Podesta emails, he’s not kidding.Grab a beverage and put your feet up.  This is good. ',fake
'“The Clinton’s are criminals, remember that, they are criminals,” were the words that brought cheers and chants of “lock her up” as Donald Trump addressed the huge crowd gathered to hear him speak Thursday in West Palm Beach, FL. This was one of the best speeches of this campaign.Trump said at the 1:15 point, early in his speech, “There is nothing that the political establishment will not do, no lie that they won’t tell, to hold their prestige and power at your expense, and that’s what’s been happening. The Washington establishment and the financial and media corporations that fund them, exist for only one reason, to protect and enrich itself.”“The establishment has trillions of dollars at stake in this election,” he said. “As an example, just one single trade deal they’d like to pass involves trillions of dollars, controlled by many countries, corporations and lobbyists. For those who control the levers of power in Washington and for the global special interests, they partner with these people that don’t have your good in mind.”“Our campaign represents a true existential threat like they haven’t seen before.” Mr. Trump points out, “This is not simply another four year election. This is a crossroads in the history of our civilization that will determine whether or not we the people reclaim control over our government.”He tells his supporters that the same people who are trying so desperately to derail his campaign are the same ones responsible for the problems that plague us, all of them brought about by their criminality and conflicts of interest, actions which have “bled our country dry.”At about the 5:00 minute mark he notes how the Clinton machine is at the center of the global system and how the Clintons meet in secret to plot the destruction of US sovereignty. He’s not exaggerating. Globalization is the elimination of borders and that means the death of our nation.At the 8:15 point he says, “The corporate media in our country is no longer involved in journalism. They are a political special interest, no different than any lobbyist or other financial entity with a total political agenda. And the agenda is not for you, it’s for themselves.”At the 8:50 mark he points out that this is war and the fascist establishment power bloc will do anything that is required for them to win. He makes some very powerful comments about this being our last chance to save our nation, on November 8th. Forget your brainwashing since your youth, America. Mr. Trump has some truths he’s laying down and they require action.The whole speech is quite good and worth a listen.Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'Even the Obama apologists at CNN can’t change reality to hide the truth as much as Hillary Clinton would like, or deflect the real damage the truth could cause her campaign. Obamacare increases of their admitted 26 percent will be bad enough, but Donald Trump says that’s the deceptive good news. The inaccurate, overly generous good news. “If you like your 26 percent increase you can keep your 26 percent increase” is a hard sell to make, given Obama’s track record. The real amount of increases will be much higher.\r\nAccording to the government report released on Monday, those are the numbers. But that’s the corrupt Obama government and it is not to be believed. Trump sees increases more than doubling in some states, such as Arizona where premiums will rise by 116 percent. He names many others who are experiencing significant increases in premiums and deductibles and decreases in coverage.\r\n\r\nThe weak reporters at CNN blame “sicker-than-anticipated” customers, an admission by any insurance company that they’re not doing a very good job of risk management and analysis. How could all of the insurers have failed at such a basic and critical function simultaneously? It’s not likely that they did. There’s a little trickery involved somewhere.

'Donald Trump followed up his superior debate performance in Las Vegas with a speech on Thursday in Ohio. He started by cleaning up a little unfinished business from the night before. Mr. Trump announced to his crowd in attendance and to the nation “that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election – if I win. With that he pointed to the crowd and broke into a huge grin. Maybe the media jackals will get the joke, odds are they won’t.Trump acknowledged that the question of voter fraud came up during the debate. He said, “We want fairness in the election. This is having nothing to do with me but having to do with the future of our country. We have to have fairness. He then quotes the Clinton campaign chairman, John Podesta as saying in emails revealed by WikiLeaks, “Illegal immigrants could vote as long as they have their driver’s license. What I’m saying is don’t be naive folks, don’t be naive.”Trump noted, “One of the big issues that came up last night was the fact that the Clinton campaign has paid people to disrupt violently our rallies and to insight absolute, total bedlam.” Chants of “lock her up” broke out in the crowd. Trump says, “You know I’ve had occasions where we had rallies and it was so incredibly violent, I said, ‘What’s going on over here?’ These were paid people by the Clinton campaign and it just came out, and I give a lot of credit to the people that brought this out, believe me.”“This is criminal behavior that violates centuries of tradition,” says Trump, “of peaceful democratic elections.” A campaign like Clinton’s, that will incite violence, is truly a campaign that will do anything to win.” He points to a long list of examples noting that committing voter fraud has to be included. Trump also points out that Clinton had been given a question word for word by DNC chairwoman Donna Brazile while she was working at CNN.After referencing the pressure on Brazile to resign as DNC chair following the release of the information, Trump asks why shouldn’t Clinton also be required to resign. He says, “Think of it, she was given these questions, she used these questions, studied the questions, got the perfect answer for the questions, and never said that she did something that was totally wrong and inappropriate; hence the name, Crooked Hillary.Her corruption is magnified in that she is running for the presidency, she should have reported the “mistake” but once again, just as with her criminal email arrangement, she didn’t. Trump announced, “Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt and dishonest person ever to seek the office of the presidency. So it’s in that context that I was asked a question about whether I would agree in advance to concede the results on election night, if for some reason we should lose, which we’re not going to lose.”He describes the unprecedented question, the attempt to concede the results in advance and commit to accepting their fraud and to waive protections provided by our system of government to the voters. That’s why Obama has been making arguments about the need to “stop whining” and accept the results. He and Hillary Clinton have both been working through the DNC to commit election fraud and they would like nothing better than to force their opponent to comply with their manipulated false results.Trump goes on to point out many of the flaws in the system, many of them purposely engineered into it by Democrats and Republicans alike to manipulate the results of elections, to do exactly what the Clinton camp is doing right now. He cites statistics for illegal aliens voters registered, dead voters registered and voters registered in multiple states.America has a system of laws that are triggered in the event of fraud or in the event of a recount where it’s needed. He says, “Of course I would accept a clear election result, but I would also reserve my right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result.He promises to put America first to chants of “USA.”Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'Trump: The age old battle between good and evil is continuing in the US election to determine the next, and perhaps the last, president of our once great nation. If Hillary Clinton is elected, regardless of the specifics of how the events play out, she will likely be the last American president, at least in this incarnation of America.The subordination of the United States to international authority is at the top of their agenda and they will use force if given the opportunity to subjugate or attempt to subjugate the American people. If Donald Trump is elected, that hot war is just beginning, but we live to fight another day and our nation has a chance at survival.The gloves are off and it is becoming increasingly clear that Donald Trump knows the true nature of the enemy. He’s now saying so in his rallies. Many of his attendees are patriots who have been aware of the globalist intrusions as they occurred; many likely understood the threat before he did. Now we’re all coming together as one combined fighting force, the liberators of our nation from the world government kleptocrats who have seized power.On Tuesday night Mr. Trump made several references to the true nature of the “evil empire” the establishment anti-American forces which occupy many high positions in both parties, which he has now declared war upon. Rep Paul Ryan has been identified by Mr. Trump as the face of the evil empire, a distinction he shares with Hillary Clinton.He told a crowd of approximately 8,000 people in Panama City Beach, FL that Hillary Clinton is full of “so much corruption.” He repeated his declaration of Sunday’s debate that he would be obligated to order a criminal probe into her corruption, both during and following her State Department tenure.Trump said, “We have to investigate Hillary Clinton, and we have to investigate the investigation! She was a disaster and she’s a bad person. Remember that. She’s a bad, bad person.”Over half of Mr. Trump’s nearly hour long speech was composed of new material, much of it content that originated in WikiLeaks documents. The latest are the emails of Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta who is also a fat cat lobbyist and former senior adviser to Hussein Obama.Mr. Trump understands the plotting against the American people, the treason engaged in by the Obama White House, Hillary Clinton, Jeh Johnson, John Kerry and Valerie Jarrett. He understands and is vocalizing the reality that they are attacking this nation with the specific objective of destroying it.Trump said of his opponent, “Speaking in secret to a foreign bank, again just revealed, Hillary said ‘My dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders.’ Well, there goes the rest of your businesses. And there goes your country, folks.”He added, “Behind closed doors when she thought no one was listening, she pledged to dissolve the borders of the United States of America. No borders! If you don’t have borders, we don’t have a country.”“WikiLeaks has given us a window into the secret corridors of government power,” Trump said, “where we see a former secretary of state announcing her desire to end forever the American independence that our founders gave to us and wanted us to have. American soldiers have fought and died to win and keep America’s freedom, and now Hillary Clinton wants to surrender that freedom to these open borders, open trade, and a world government.”He noted, “We’re protecting the borders of foreign countries, but not our borders. These WikiLeaks emails confirm what those of us here today have known all along: Hillary Clinton is the vessel of a corrupt globalist establishment that’s raiding our country and surrendering the sovereignty of our nation.”He added, “This criminal government cartel doesn’t recognize borders but believes in global governance, unlimited immigration and rule by corporations.’Mr. Trump understands that America is under siege, that the attempted conquest of our nation from within started at least in the first Bush administration and likely long before that, and has been being implemented progressively ever since. It has continued through both Democrat and Republican administrations, with the pace quickening significantly under the current Obama regime.We’re in a war, at least we have found a leader who is willing to take off the shackles and fight back. It’s a fight for our futures, for our families, for our nation and for good over evil, that we all need to join him in.Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'Donald Trump says that the election system is rigged.  Guess what.  He’s right.In the battle for the mind of the American voter, not much is used more often than polls.  When building up a winner, it is vital to make it LOOK like one side or the other is winning.  No one wants to be associated with a loser, so part of the publicity strategy is to create the image that one side or the other is winning or losing.In order to make it look like Democrats, in particular, are winning, the coalition of people that includes John Podesta and his tribe of Hillary Helpers came up with a way to make the polls, at least, appear to have their candidates up.  It’s called oversampling, and the method is used to plump up percentages.  From Zero Hedge via The Gateway Pundit.“For all of you out there who still aren’t convinced that the polls are “adjusted”, we present to you the following Podesta email, leaked earlier today, that conveniently spells out, in detail, exactly how to “manufacture” the desired data. The email starts out with a request for recommendations on “oversamples for polling” in order to “maximize what we get out of our media polling.”That particular email is accompanied by a guide that tells of specific over sampling strategies PER STATE.  For example, in Florida, sampling first happens in Orlando and Tampa where the people are more friendly to Democrats.  Arizona oversamples with Hispanics.  The idea is to make the candidate more popular than he or she really is.Reverse strategies are used to bring down the opponent.  Sneaky, huh?',fake
'Robert and Rebekah Mercer are mega-donors who are recognized as two of the most influential figures associated with the Trump campaign. They were previously also backing Ted Cruz although his less-than-gracious refusal to endorse Mr. Trump at the Republican convention may have ended that relationship forever. There are financial consequences for significant violations of their code of conduct. Some had feared the video of eleven years ago might have met that threshold.Mr. Mercer and his daughter did not become billionaires by being ignorant or by being poor judges of character. They have a talent that is unique among those of considerable means; an ability to recognize what this country truly needs and a willingness to look with insight beyond the pandering and fulfillment of short term self-interest.They recognize that Donald Trump is the solution to what ails this nation and were not persuaded by the many cowards, frauds, establishment hacks and political harlots who are serving their masters and covering their own disingenuous backsides by attacking or severing ties with the Republican nominee.On Friday the Mercers issued the following statement through the Washington Post, the paper which initially broke the anti-Trump video in service to their mistress, Hillary Clinton.“If Mr. Trump had told Billy Bush, whoever that is, earlier this year that he was for open borders, open trade, and executive actions in pursuit of gun control, we would certainly be rethinking our support for him. If he had admitted to Mr. Bush that he had profited privately by allowing the sale to Russia of 20\% of US uranium deposits or that he had amassed his personal fortune not by hard work in the private sector but by selling favors to foreigners on the American taxpayers’ dime, we would certainly be rethinking our support for him. If he had argued that he needed both a public and a private position on issues facing the American public, we would certainly be rethinking our support for him. And finally if Trump had serially terrorized and silenced the victims of violent sexual assault whom he feared could damage his political career, we would most definitely be rethinking our support for him.“Donald Trump’s uncensored comments, both old and new, have been echoed and dissected in the media repeatedly in an effort to kindle among his supporters a conflagration of outrage commensurate with the media’s own faux outrage. Can anyone really be surprised that Mr. Trump could have said to Mr. Bush such things as he has already admitted saying? No. We are completely indifferent to Mr. Trump’s locker room braggadocio.“The same media that resolutely looked away when the most powerful man in the world, a sitting U.S. president with multiple violent sexual assaults to his credit, snared an impressionable young intern in his web and ruined her life, now expects us to gasp with revulsion at Mr. Trump’s irreverent comments. America is finally fed up and disgusted with its political elite. Trump is channeling this disgust and those among the political elite who quake before the boom box of media blather do not appreciate the apocalyptic choice that America faces on November 8th. We have a country to save and there is only one person who can save it. We, and Americans across the country and around the world, stand steadfastly behind Donald J. Trump.”Are you getting the message Paul Ryan and the rest of you cheap political tarts? Your days are numbered. Your spectacle is not having the desired results and may, in fact, be in the process of blowing up in your face.Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'Donald Trump kept his powder dry and held fire for the first part of his speech at the Al Smith Dinner in New York City, accepting and dishing out the typical good-natured roasting that these events feature.

'In what might be a keep your friends close and your enemies closer move, President-Elect Donald Trump named his first Chief of Staff on Sunday, November 13.  The political appointee is none other than Republican National Committee Chairman, Reince Priebus.In addition to the GOP front man, Trump also named Steve Bannon, executive chairman of Breitbart News  and Trump campaign CEO, as a chief strategist and senior counselor.  From CNN:Video from Newsy.The move to pair these two political operatives from opposite sides of the Republican spectrum is seen as an effort to comfort the GOP rank and file and the nontrusting, Deplorable wing more interested in draining the swamp of Washington, D.C., than preserving any sort of political continuity let over from the previous administrations.Priebus was widely regarded as one of the people who laid the groundwork for a Republican victory for president in 2016 via deconstruction of the 2012 election, and his efforts to hold the party together despite the dissent of many when the primaries produced Trump as the nominee.  Bannon is known to have been one of the two finalists for the Chief of Staff position.  His appointment as a special adviser indicates Trump’s trust in him, and possibly an interest from the Mercer family, owners of Breitbart, who switched allegiance from Sen. Ted Cruz to Donald Trump in the later months of the campaign.Additional staffing decisions are expected in the coming weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMyVisits Counter \r\n',fake
'Some political observers would say, “IT’S ABOUT TIME!” that Donald Trump is putting out hard hitting, anti-Hillary advertising in the last week of the presidential election campaign.  In this case, timing may be everything, as well as placement since these ads are running not just at any time of day or night, but during the World Series.  (Given this year’s competitors, the Series has amazingly high ratings.)However, when it comes to the Clintons, and the hubris that leads to scandal and headlines, sometimes waiting until the last moment for maximum impact is the way to go.  That may be the thinking behind the newest ad from Trump and the Republican National Committee.  It’s called “Clinton Corruption” and it hits all the major points.Yes, the Clintons got rich off of their “foundation” that was set up as some sort of money laundering scheme for pay to play politics while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State. Yes, they charged outrageous speaking fees, as prominent people are wont to do, to appear at any number of venues.  Yes, their email system – hers anyway – was illegal for the way it was used.  This is not news.The reality that the FBI is looking into it in five different field offices…that cannot be ignored.My fellow Americans, we are in the home stretch of a brutal election year.  Usually at the end, the campaigns are out of cash and are scraping to actually afford effective advertising in time slots where people will actually see it.  By not spending any cash early, and riding on Mainstream Media coverage – good or bad – Trump now has the cash along with the Republican National Committee to put out the hard hitting stuff.  It’s a different strategy from normal, and far more effective.  Straight out of a marketing textbook, in fact.  (Think the political professionals will notice?  Me neither.)',fake
'In a campaign stop in Johnstown, PA, Donald Trump took a few moments to draw attention to what he identified as “the dishonest people in the media,” noting that they play a large role in the rigging of the system.Trump gives what he’s saying a little time to soak in and observes the interaction between his supporters and the dishonest Clinton supporters he had just identified. He says, “Isn’t it amazing how, you know, they don’t even want to look at you folks. I think they consider you, like Hillary they consider you deplorable and irredeemable also.”He continues, saying, “By the way, tonight when you go home and watch this on television, the only people you’re going to see,” as he turns around an points directly behind him. The members of his crowd positioned there break into applause as Trump turns back around, shaking his head and saying, “The only people they’ll show.”“No, they’re not going to show the record-setting crowds,” says Trump. “They’re going to show the people [in] back but, you know what, their seat isn’t as good. But they’re going to become more famous because of this.”He forms a little viewfinder box with his hands, mimicking the small segment of the huge crowds that they allow to be seen. The only part of the popularity argument that they can’t falsify are the crowds. They can lie about poll numbers, control the messaging in the media, focus on the unimportant while ignoring Clinton’s disqualifying crimes, medical conditions, judgment and lack of moral character, but they can’t fake the bodies in the seats. Their answer is to not show the huge Trump crowds, to remove it from part of the landscape.Trump knows what they’re up to and he’s got a plan to get around their inherent dishonesty. He asks, “Can somebody act out being a protester so the cameras will all move over? He immediately has a volunteer in the audience so Trump announces to the media people, “There’s a protester, there’s a protester. The only time they move those cameras…oh look, there’s a protester, look,” as another volunteer takes up the challenge.  A third volunteer steps up to which Trump responds, “There’s another protester.He adds, “These people are the worst.” The crowd agrees.',fake
'Everyone heard about the black homeless woman who guarded and defended Trumps LA sidewalk star.  She got attacked by a group of radical liberals who beat her to a pulp.  She really took a beating and Clinton says that “Trump supporters are violent”. What a crock! Hillary’s Campaign paid those “violent supporters” $1,500.00 each to cause riots and injury to Trumps loyal movement. This  truth came out in a Wikileaks email. The clip shows how violent LA liberals were to this poor woman.The homeless woman is in hiding and the LAPD is looking for her.  Micheal Cohen, the attorney for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is looking for the homeless Black woman seen on video being attacked by a mob of Hillary Clinton supporters as she protected Trump’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame after it was sledgehammered by a Clinton supporter earlier this week.Trump Organization EVP, Micheal Cohen and Special Counsel to Donald J. Trump, spoke out on Twitter Friday evening about Mr. Trump’s desire–before it was known to him that she was attacked by the Clinton mob–to present an unspecified gift to the woman. Cohen said he had a friend in Hollywood looking for her.After learning she had been attacked, Cohen promised she would have “the last laugh on these thugs.”Cohen told a supporter to not contact the Trump campaign about the woman but to DM him on Twitter with any information as to her whereabouts., indicating this has become a personal matter for Trump.As soon as they find her, Trump will reward her with a fabulous gift that everyone in the USA will hear about and we can be sure it’s a generous gift of cash. It’s just a matter of finding her in order for Trump to give it to her. Many people are searching and everyone hopes she is still alive!A homeless American protects @realDonaldTrump Hollywood star. 20 million illegals & Americans sleep on the streets in Tents #VoteTrump.@DiamondandSilk @realDonaldTrump someone please help me locate this woman as Mr. Trump has a gift for her…. @MichaelCohen212 @DiamondandSilk @realDonaldTrump Yaaass! It’s Christmas early for the American people! Give this patriot a gift!! .@aGirlisN0one @DiamondandSilk @realDonaldTrump Someone please help me find this woman.

'Washington/ Islamabad: Is Mr Donald Trump adjusting his US foreign policy depending on where construction of new Trump Towers projects is being executed, insiders in Washington are whispering.

'In yet another twist that’s proving 2016 is the most bizarre election season ever, news comes from Tinsel Town that Donald Trump’s star on Hollywood Boulevard is being guarded by a woman.  Not just any woman, but a black, homeless woman.Wow.  Just wow.  At a time when so many of us are afraid to advertise our allegiance to the Trump Train for fear of personal property damage, this woman spells out one of the most compelling reasons to vote against Hillary.  The policies of the past five decades HAVE caused an explosion of people living on the streets.  The base reasons why millions of Americans are homeless vary, but the reality is that even the homeless have it worse than they used to thanks to competition from illegals.What is most distressing about this woman’s attempt to guard Trump’s star from further vandalism, is that the liberals who walk the streets out on the left coast decided to attack her for exercising her freedom of speech.Liberals can’t even let a down and out homeless person have their own opinion either!? What bullies! This homeless black woman took takes up guard for Trump’s hollywood star that got destroyed by a CRAZY liberal the other day, and now liberals are all up in her grill trying to tell her why she’s wrong to do so.How dare they right? After they are done shouting at her about how wrong she is…they get to go home to warmth and food. While she remains in the streets…they need back off! She has a right to believe what she wants to.What the libs REALLY didn’t take well to…was her signs, she was very real about how she felt about Obama and his treatment of black people specifically and Americans in general!And what did her signs say?  Twitter user PeterDuke MAGA 3x has photos. Some of the text is too small on the signs to be clearly made out.Doesn’t matter.  In the year of the anti-establishment, no new world order movement, even the homeless are getting into the act.This woman needs help on a number of levels.  Maybe patriotic Americans will be moved to do something about her plight and those of the people like her who fend for themselves on the streets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Traffic Estimate \r\n',fake
'Trump Supporters at a Trump rally in Cincinnati, OH, the patriots who showed up to hear Mr. Trump speak and to show their support also had a message for the corrupt Hillary Clinton propagandists who laughably call themselves journalists, the mainstream media.The lying liberal implements of deception were greeted by approximately 20,000 Americans who are fed up with their lies and their naked attempts to silence their voices and manipulate the outcome of the election. The media has demonstrated beyond any shadow of a doubt that they work for the globalists backing Clinton, that’s who they want to see elected, that is who they are being paid to promote and they will do virtually anything to make it happen. Ethics and journalistic integrity are of no concern to any of them.\r\nThe rally was held last Thursday but they certainly don’t seem to have learned anything, their reporting is still as corrupt and anti-American as ever. As the political street walkers entered the arena, a loud chorus of spontaneous boos erupted throughout the entire building. The attendees were chanting “tell the truth,” and “CNN sucks,” which was recorded by InfoWars reporter, Millie Weaver.She asks a couple of the media people, who appear to be making a hasty exit in the face of an angry public, “How does it feel to have been called out by thousands of Americans for being lying and corrupt?” Neither answered as both seemed much more concerned with their personal security than with offering their input. Weaver commented on that aspect as well, saying, “You could see the fear on some of these guys’ faces in the media, in the mainstream media.America is fighting back, we’ve had enough. The criminal syndicate that has hijacked our nation doesn’t play by the same rules we do. It’s time we take our own handcuffs off and let them know that we’ve done so. Demanding that these charlatans actually conduct themselves as journalists and report both sides of the issues is a start.Public disdain for their corruption and lack of character is something that now comes with their territory, something that can’t be good for advertising revenue. Just where will Wolf Blitzer or Anderson Cooper go to work when CNN and MSNBC are no more? No matter where they go, nobody is going to watch them. That is how we win in the long term. In the short term, the people of Cincinnati seem to have it figured out.Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'In his first post-election interview since his victory over Democratic queen Hillary Clinton, President-Elect Donald Trump told CBS’s Leslie Stahl the multi-pronged attack at saving the taxpayers money just through his White House:“The answer is no,” he said, when asked about his campaign trail promise by CBS interviewer Lesley Stahl. “I think I have to take by law one dollar so I’ll take one dollar a year.”He admitted that he didn’t even know what the salary was, but when he was told it was $400,000 salary he declined it.“I’m not taking it,” he said.He added that he would not be taking too many vacations either.',fake
'The establishment “A” team, A-Hole leaders of the “nevertrump” conspiracy to sabotage America’s future for the sake of their own profit and power, are making their move. Whether the “Billy Bush and The Bus Bimbo” tape was  dug up by the Clinton campaign or by the Bush family and the rest of their fellow uniparty fascists is irrelevant. Whether ¿Jeb? expressed his congratulatory “attaboy amigo” to cousin Billy for a job well-done or it was Obama in direct conversations thanking Jeff Bezos of the Washington Post doesn’t really matter. The lines are clearly drawn. They are all on one side and we Americans are on the other.Theirs is the side of the establishment two-party mirage that is pillaging and destroying America as the vitality is sucked out and our greatness as a nation is robbed from us. Ours is the side of the American people standing behind our human, and therefore flawed, leader. Donald Trump is the only man who can and is willing to lead us out of the morass into which these self-serving traitors, the so-called government, have put us.Our United States government no longer exists. A criminal syndicate with the ability to fund itself through confiscated wealth and the power to impose its will through the state has taken its place. We Americans have had enough of the charade; we’re not fooled. The illusion of the two party, left-right paradigm is well known, Republicans and Democrats are tools of the same elites. This is not even a government any longer. It is an oppressive, exploitative criminal organization.Paul Ryan is a traitorous political whore put into power by the elites as their operative in a negotiated deal. The so-called “Freedom Caucus” of the House was at best naively persuaded to “trust him” because he spoke to them rather than down at them and made them feel important. It’s not unlike the embarrassing ecstasy liberal Sally Field experienced when she suddenly realized that the members of the Motion Picture Academy really liked her. How liked do you foolish boys feel now? Some are probably quite pleased with themselves and their traitorous leader, Paul Ryan, being of the same sleazy stock.The entire state of Utah, it seems, is in the grips of a power-mad Mormon cartel that is a strong faction of the establishment kleptocracy. Is there some sort of underhanded fulfillment of Joseph Smith’s prophecy at play here, a role Ted Cruz was supposed to be playing? Most Mormons are great people, but their Church does exercise tremendous influence and they are, apparently quite willing to abuse their firm grip on power and their control. Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) was the orchestrator of the TPP, the international arrangement that cedes US sovereignty to the globalist regional government. Former governor Jon Huntsman, who is also a former Ambassador to China under Hussein Obama and a GOP globalist candidate for president in 2012 is helping to spearhead that betrayal.Huntsman’s puppy dog, Senator Mike Lee, whom he threatened with a primary challenge if he didn’t obey orders prior to his last election, Utah Gov. Gary Herbert and Paul Ryan’s number one leg-humper, Rep. Jason Chaffetz, have all joined in one last-ditch effort to have Mr. Trump kicked off of the ticket. What’s going on in Utah? How can a state built by Mormons, who have a history of polygamy and the forced marriage of young girls against their will to much older men, have suddenly found themselves occupants of a holier-than-thou moral high ground? Have they all self-righteously qualified themselves to throw the fist stone?Then there’s their demi-god, Mitt Romney, the voice of the neverTrump movement. It should more accurately be called the anti-America or neverAmerica movement, because Trump represents us and our future and they are targeting the nation through him. A failure to elect Donald Trump will complete the transformation of our nation from a country that is governed by the people to one that is governed by corporate fascists. We’re almost there now but there’s just a few more finishing touches that Hillary Clinton needs to add to make it official.Calls for Mike Pence to step in like a modern day Gerald Ford are just a way for the establishment types to offer an acceptable, palatable replacement for Trump. He’s one that most Republicans, they falsely believe, would  accept as an alternative, and “the guy we should have picked in the first place.” Nobody wanted Gerald Ford after they ran Nixon off and we don’t want Mike Pence as an imitation Donald Trump.We chose Trump, whether the “neverAmerica” crowd likes it or is willing to accept him or not. That’s who we intend to have as our president, imperfect as he is. Once again, through his imperfections, Trump has shown he’s just like us, he’s a regular American; he’s real.The establishment would be comfortable with a candidate who was slinking around in Chicago bath houses with other men or in Miami bubble bath hot tubs. They’d be keeping those things hush-hush because they would cement their power. Trump can’t be blackmailed and he may even have known these revelations would be coming out. They may have tried to coerce him into quitting prior to their release but he would have no part of it.Trump is not a quitter and we’re not quitting on him or on our nation. We’re not going to surrender the United States to the forces of the evil establishment. The fight is on. Unlike the regime we have no problem identifying and vocalizing our enemy. It’s Hillary Clinton, the Democrats, the Republican establishment and the globalist, anti-American oligarchs.As Rowdy Roddy Piper announced to a bank full of thinly disguised globalists in the classic scene from the movie They Live, “I have come here to chew bubble gum and kick ass. And I’m all out of bubble gum.” We Americans also find ourselves to be fresh out of bubble gum. Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'If ever there was a microcosm of the Trump vs. The Media row that permeates the America first movement manifesting in the United States, the simple request Donald Trump asked of the cameras at a rally in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania is it.  Watch what happens when The Donald asks the people operating the cameras to show the crowd.In the video, multiple cameras did move, but the majority did not.  The camera angles are generally concentrating on Trump himself, and what he says, trying to catch him in some sort of gaffe.  The narrative pushed by the lying mainstream media is that Hillary Clinton is leading in the polling, and Trump’s train is losing steam.  From the non-mainstream media sources, and witnesses to the rallies that make Donald Trump look like the Energizer Bunny, We the People know that lines to get into the events are long, and that the people attending them come from all walks of life.This video is an example of why Donald Trump has taken on the mainstream media, the corporate media, the people for whom authority in order to build ratings is everything.  For reasons that most people assume have to do with the ownership of the networks, the people charged with keeping the public informed are telling a version of reality that does not exist – and thanks to some whistleblower out there who provided WikiLeaks with tens of thousands of Democratic operatives’ emails, we know that it is in collusion with the opposition.',fake

He was doing wonderful. The dim-star studded judges panel was impressed too. But things changed when he was asked questions after performance.‘Great performance Kooly, I can feel the positive vibes in your omelette, but you forgot to add salt. Though your dance steps while beating egg did not match the rap. But you can improve on it’, said Judge 1.Kooly thanked and waited for second Judge to respond, who gave him a standing ovation and said he doesn’t have words to describe anything, as dance seemed like shaking coconut tree, while his omelette tastes like shampoo and he sang like ailing animal, but together everything looked like an art just as this show requires.The third judge however asked about more important selection criteria, his backstory. And everything messed up.\r\r\n\r\n‘I had a normal life. My family is middle class. My college is average. I don’t know if anything really sad is there in my life’, Kooleshwar said.On further probing, he denied of any specific incident which makes him sad.Shocked judges and TV channel producers had nothing but to reject Kooly.‘Kooly had no violence, no parents pressure, no ailing family members, he also had house to live, no injustice. On what basis we could have selected him. Sure he had talent, but we need a good backstory so we can truly make change in society and obviously stretch our show for a one hour with only 15 minutes of performance.’ said reality show sources.Kooly is heart broken but still doesn’t feel much sad about it.

'Somewhere in Alien-Land: World renowned organization for awarding random things– UNESCO, Which has earlier given awards to India’s National Anthem, National Song, National Prime Minister, President, and what not, has decided to take their work a step further. Today they have decided to award Virat Kohli for the loss against Pakistan. The award for most charitable person, as the organization informs, is given to person who goes out of his duty lines to fulfil the wishes of poor and needy. On 4th of this month, when India beat Pakistan, thousands of television sets in community centers (the only areas presumably in Pakistan where TV sets are found, were broken).Angered at the loss of their property every time India plays Pakistan, the managers of these places had written an emotional letter to Indian team to avoid the watershed beating. Mr. Jaleel Ahmad of Pakistan TV Breaking Fund informed us, “Pakistan was running short of TV sets to break.”“We urge Mr. Kohli and his men to have some mercy, and give us some time to get TV sets, before you beat them next”, he requested.As it is understood, this letter moved Kohli to the core, who also understood that next time India plays Pakistan will be in World Cup 2019. By then, Pakistan would have acquired enough TV sets to again start the routine of breaking. But, was this the reason for India loosing the match?You never know; however, UNESCO considers that it was pre decided by Virat and Indian team to only beat them once the poor country has acquired enough funds to buy those TV sets.After the notification, Officials from Pakistan lended their backing  to this announcement to award Virat. They are also contemplating to give their highest peace prize to Virat Kohli for understanding the sentiments of poor Pakistanis.',fake
'Unhinged Hillary Clinton’s cackle sometimes seems to serve as a mask for who she really is. For her anything that can hide any aspect of the Clinton composite is surely a benefit. Sometimes the real Clinton slips out, she can’t control herself very well and there are those occasions when cameras are turned on and she’s less than diplomatic. This was on of those situations and may serve as an eye-opener into what kind of abusive person she really is. There is not shortage of horror stories from former and current Secret Service agents who’ve had the misfortune to have worked her detail. Confidentiality agreements have helped her out lately in keeping her true nature hidden from the public.Clinton demonstrated just how much of a witch, and how sensitive she is about not being given her full due of adoration, by snapping off the head of a Congolese student during a question and answer session in 2009. He probably thought he’d crafted a really good, liberal-compliant question that was contained enough irrelevant academia-based drivel to make him a superstar back on campus. Instead, he was made to look like an idiot by the evil woman he had misjudged based upon his limited knowledge of who and what she was. If he’d known more he probably would likely have never wasted his time coming to see her.In the aftermath of Clinton’s vicious attack, the State Department attempted to explain her outburst as the result of the questioner’s nervousness. Baloney. What got under her skin was the questioner asking her to provide her husband’s views rather than her own. He said, “What does Mr. Clinton think through the mouth of Mrs. Clinton?”Her building anger is visible on her face at what she takes as a slight to her abilities and status as a manipulative unqualified female. She worked hard manipulating herself into a position she has no business holding and she doesn’t appreciate someone being more interested in the former president’s opinion that hers.Unhinged Hillary was seething as she asked for clarification, saying, “Wait, you want me to tell you what my husband thinks? My husband is not the Secretary of State, I am.” She followed that statement up with a stare, a scornful admonition, and a “take that and stuff it” sort of hand flip.She added in an extremely arrogant manner, “You ask my opinion I will tell you my opinion, I’m not going to be channeling my husband.” The look that kills was unleashed a few moments later. This woman is described by virtually anyone who has had the misfortune to have worked closely with her as a witch, notorious for consistently having these demeaning, hateful outbursts. Combined with her criminality and her treason, it’s difficult to understand why anyone on this earth would support her for any office. Women voters should be repulsed at the thought of being represented by something like this.Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'Chennai, Oct 19: Triple Talaq and the Uniform Civil Code are making controversial headlines again. As with most matters, the general public is uninformed on these too because most of the time it is getting its information from the wrong sources — internet,WhatsApp forwards and news outlets that are mostly dependent on internet and WA fwds. We at Crank’s News are different though. We don’t trust second-hand sources, we generally make up our information. Here we step in to clear the existing confusions by creating totally new ones.In typical Q & A format, Crank’s News addresses the important issues in the Triple Talaqsystem in typical non-nonsense, irresponsible way. Being a subject of religious sensitivity, we know one thing for sure: No matter what, some group somewhere will surely takeoffence. Further, this piece also contains stuff that may offend a group that also comprise people who are generally more touchy than religious guys. But prudence demands that we don’t directly identify them as advocates.1) Give us a broad background to this Triple Talaq issueAns: Triple Talaq is a simple procedure by which a Muslim man can divorce his wife. All he has to do is utter ‘talaq‘ three times. This makes it clear that be it religion or government, doing things in triplicate is extremely important.2) What are the grounds of opposing the Triple Talaq?Ans: Quite obviously, Triple Talaq flies in the face of all canons of modern justice sytemthat make it mandatory for judicial processes, as guaranteed in the Constitution, to be extremely complex. Article 22/7 of the Constitution lays it all down pretty clearly: All matters pertaining to the judicial system, ipso facto, will sedulously have to be made difficult to understand by various methods, including by use of strange phrases from Latin, a language that is dead for centuries.On a slightly more sombre note, the Triple Talaq system, it has been argued, works against the interests of women. But as people who lay down the rules, should we be allowed to be distracted by such extraneous and irrelevant arguments is the larger question that men folks are having to ponder.But lest it be construed that Triple Talaq will signal the end to all ties between a woman and her husband, there is room in the system for them to become conjugal couples again, provided the woman marries another man and who subsequently divorces her. Seriously, this is the rule.Anyway, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board has taken a pragmatic and the most reasonable women-centric view in this matter.3) What are they?Ans: AIMPLB has made a strong case that the Triple Talaq is in favour of women by its very nature. In an affidavit filed with the Supreme Court in the Shayara Bano Vs Union of India & others case, the AIMPLB said Triple Talaq is the most desirable practice for getting divorce because it keeps lawyers and courts totally out of it. Okay, it didn’t say this, but it did argue that the Triple Talaq system is actually beneficial to women.Going against the general principle of Crank’s News, we, for the first time, are going to use facts here. These are the real reasons that the AIMPLB gave in an affidavit to the Supreme Court: 1. Granting husband the right to divorce indirectly provides security to wife. 2. Women get killed when men don’t have easy divorce. 3. Obtaining divorce from courtsscandalises women’s character, for men the damage is little. 4. Obtaining divorce from courts ‘deters re-marriage’ prospects of men, women.As you can see, it is a perfectly reasonable stand, especially the second one. Nobody with a sensible mind can argue against it. Nothing drives a man wild than an intransigent women refusing to grant him or anybody else divorce. Not giving divorce is a major cause of death among women — roughly around 17\% of all deaths — across the world, according to a recent study.4) If Pakistan and many other countries have abolished triple talaq, why can’t India?Ans: Because those are countries that don’t follow — pay close attention here — the Indian Constitution. Well, the point is if equality and dignity is a fundamental right then the right to practise one’s religion and its rules are also a fundamental right. It is for the court to decide and bring some nuance into the whole debate and settle the matter in a manner that is acceptable and agreeable to all concerned. But the court, you’d appreciate, has been hard-pressed for time, as it has to work non-stop on matters of extreme importance, like whether the Indian cricket team selection committee should comprise three or five members.5) How is the case expected to pan out now?Ans: We adjourn the answer to a future piece of Crank’s News on The UnReal Times.(Originally published on Crank’s Corner)',fake
'It seems to be PM Modi’s signature style. He will often stay silent for a prolonged period of time, absorbing criticism, ridicule and even abuse from opponents and sympathisers, and then suddenly, seemingly like a bolt from the blue, he will do something that trolls the pants off his critics. Yesterday was one such day when PM Modi once again proved to media houses that his is the prime time show with the highest TRPs when he announced via an address to the nation that his government is abolishing Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes, effective midnight.Even as black money hoarders writhed and squirmed, PM Modi rubbed it in with his version of English.For a while after the address, there were no reactions from PM Modi’s political opponents, mostly because many of them were scrambling to get rid of their cash by midnight. The means they adopted followed from their respective intellectual abilities. Some did this……while others decided to take advantage of the fact that government hospitals will continue to accept 500/1000 rupee notes for another three daysWe thought we’d give people an option, but it remains to be seen how many fell for it…Some unfortunate souls, however, were short on options.While Arnab Goswami predictably raved about the move, veteran journalist Rajdeep Sardesai equally predictably was busy looking for a contrarian voice……and eventually found one in Congress spokesperson Sanjay Jha who inexplicably brought up Panama papers like he inexplicably brings up 2002 in every debate concerning Modi. Back on Times Now, Saba Naqvi tried to evoke pathos by talking about the poor housewife or domestic help who will be inconvenienced, only to be promptly trounced by the nation’s noise.NDTV would normally have featured an interview with finance minister Arun Jaitley, and he was willing too, but…Meanwhile, down in Mumbai, residents heard a string of loud FMLs and curses from a posh residence near Mafatlal Park. When the man inside was done cursing, he picked up the phone to talk to PM Modi:At least for those in India this was just one blow. For some across the border, this was PM Modi’s second surgical strike.While Modi was trolling others, a beggar decided to troll a specific politician…When he was done trolling everyone in the real world, PM Modi trolled some in the unreal world too…When all the tamasha was done and dusted, a satisfied PM Modi caught up with BJP President Amit Shah to get a cup of tea. An awestruck Amit Shah who probably hadn’t been told about the move in advance either, asked PM Modi what his plans were…',fake
'The worlds toughest Sheriff, Joe Arpaio of Phoenix, AZ is in a challenging position two weeks before the re-election.  The U.S Department of Justice has been stalking and interrogating him for 3 years now.  They insist he was intentionally racial profiling Latino’s in traffic stops. Arpaio has acknowledged violating the terms of the order but argues that his disobedience was unintentional. Prosecutors say they will seek a jail term of up to six months for the sheriff.The 84 year old Maricopa County Sheriff is beloved by the citizens and conservatives who say Arpaio and his force have  protected them from drug dealers and dangerous criminals that illegally cross the Mexican border into our country everyday. The sheriff has been elected and served a total of 6 terms and he’s up for a 7th.Presently, things don’t look good for Arpaio.  On Tuesday, he was officially charged with criminal contempt-of-court for ignoring a judge’s order in a 3 year old racial-profiling case by Latinos and the Obama’s  Justice Dept.Arpaios lawyer, Mel McDonald said the sheriff will plead not guilty.  “We believe that when the final chapter is written, he will be vindicated.”Here’s the real kicker, the liberal judge ordered the  courts to award the Latinos money as compensation to those who were pulled over and “illegaly detained” by Arpaio who “ignored” the order.  Infact, they set aside $1 million of  TAX PAYER dollars to their compensation fund.  It seems this judge is persecuting the citizens along with the good Sheriff.The citizens stand with Sheriff Joe and his strict adherence to law and order.  He’s being crucified by a liberal court system and Obama’s “Dept. of Justice” and they’re UNJUST!A Dec. 6 trial has been scheduled in Arpaio’s criminal contempt case.

'New York: With reports of antibiotics rapidly losing their efficacy, and decling immunity in humans against deseases due to their comfortable lifestyle and overly practiced hygiene and sanitation, a bizzare trend is being witnessed recently in Americas and many parts of the Europe.Doctors in developed countries are increasingly advising their patients to either settle, or at least spend a few weeks or even months in countries with poor sanitation standards. This is widely being termed as ‘Immunity Booster Tourism’ out there by travel agents and holiday experts, and is attracting humongous amount of curiosity and interest from travelers.Expert believe, and many researchers have scientific evidence to prove, that spending some time in poor hygienic conditions boosts your immune system, that stays on for several years with you.Third world countries have welcomed this trend, and are hopeful that this will raise their economy by boosting tourism.

'As soon as the news that Varun Gandhi may possibly have been honeytrapped and compromised by an arms dealer hit the social media, there was mayhem on AAP’s Twitter handle. Some ignorant of Varun’s political affiliations, assumed he was from AAP considering the nature of charges leveled. They started the customary abusing of the party. As it turned out, Varun was from the ruling BJP. Soon, AAP hit back with double the vengeance and regular queries to PM Modi such as “Will the Modi answer?” and “Is it true?”As the day progressed, the issue was hijacked by Rahul Gandhi who gave it a political twist by promising to get a honey factory built in UP if Congress was voted to power so that no youth in the state was honeytrapped due to lack of honey at home. Soon, Congress foot soldiers from all quarters came to the front explaining Rahul’s statements to control the damage.“Understand the emotion behind Rahul ji’s statement. All he wanted to say was that he would work for the people of UP and not get trapped in scandals. Why this brouhaha?” said a top Congress leader on ‘sibbatical’.A section of twitteratti also trolled Varun Dhawan in confusion. He clarified that the allegations were made for an arms deal and not a Yashraj film deal. Thus, it was more likely that a Gandhi would be involved rather than a Dhawan.

'Virat Kohli is consistently in his top form and like other successful cricketers, he too doesn’t believe in revealing his secrets.Virat hasn’t also been really open about his personal life, be it his relationship with Anushka or his superstitious beliefs.  But nothing can be kept hidden from Faking News for a long time. Indian captain Virat Kohli was caught thanking Controversial Guru Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh Insan over phone on Thursday soon after he hit a brilliant century in 4th ODI against Sri Lanka. Virat, who has been avoiding questions on  photo of him with Gurmeet Ram Rahim that’s going viral on the internet, was caught red handed by Faking News correspondent in Colombo. After hitting century when Virat returned to the dressing room our correspondent, who was hiding under his bed, noticed him thanking someone for his knock.

You are a rockstar!”  (Thank you Father (or father like) it’s only because of your grace I could play this innings and India defeated Sri Lanka comfortably) Our correspondent confirmed the identity of person as Baba Gurmeet Ram Rahim since Virat used the words such as Rockstar and Love you Papaji, that are popular names of Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh. Baba Gurmeet Ram Rahim had already claimed to be the coach of players with the likes of Virat Kohli and Ashish Nehra. Though Virat Kohli never reacted to this claim by Gurmeet but he neither denied it. Meanwhile after Ashish Nehra failed to perform, Baba’s supporters cropped out Nehra from the picture and re-circulated it. To know the complete story Faking News reporter spoke to Virat Kohli’s manager Aniruddh who clarified, “Virat was talking to his uncle, father’s elder brother, whom he fondly calls bade papaji, he often thanks him for supporting him in his bad times”. Aniruddh left the conversation when our reporter asked him about the word “Rockstar” that Virat Kohli had used in his conversation. People across social media picked up the news and made their own stories and suggestions. One of the twitter users said “Gurmeet Ram Rahim should also give advices to Ishant Sharma”, to which Dera Saccha Sauda’s official handle replied “Even Papaji can’t help him”. This phone call by Virat is not a thing to worry as long as he keeps hitting such brilliant centuries and makes us win. But sooner or later Virat Kohli will be questioned for taking tips from a rape convict. At the same time government must be held accountable for Ram Rahim having access to mobile phone even in jail.',fake

School’s founder Virender Sehwag will be taking this class where he will teach kids this very important life skill for today’s world.Sehwag has taken the microblogging platform by storm recently and he will be sharing his wisdom with the students to help them become Twitter influencers in future. Sehwag’s jokes, witty comments and birthday wishes have won him a lot of fans online and now people eagerly await his tweets to see what he comes up with next.This will not be a part of the regular teaching schedule and will be taught in extra classes after the regular closing time. The course will be limited to the senior classes and students below 8th standard will not be allowed to attend.“We have to provide our students with the best possible education to deal with the world out there and social media has become a very important life skill. You can make a living just by using social media these days. Recently, I have been told by many people that I am very good at tweeting so why shouldn’t I share my knowledge with our students?” Sehwag said speaking to our correspondent.The swashbuckling opener further added, “At Sehwag International School, we don’t restrict ourselves to book learning alone, we want to provide all around development of the children, only then they can survive in today’s world. Once they graduate from our school, they can create their Twitter accounts and quickly become Twitter influencers, good money in that job these days. I will RT their first 5 tweets to set them on their way.”Meanwhile, some students also requested for a course on ‘Taking Selfies’ but Sehwag shot that proposal down saying it is not safe as the growing number of deaths due to selfies indicate.',fake
'Vote Trump: Former Minnesota Congresswoman Michele Bachmann made a stop on the Rusty Humphries radio program to discuss the presidential campaign and the choice that faces America as well as some of its less-than-honorable citizens.Humphries asked, “Why do you think the establishment hates Donald Trump so much?” That was an easy answer for Bachmann, who replied, “I’ll tell you why. It’s because the establishment is all in with moving toward a one-world government. Now that sounds weird, but it’s true. They believe in the idea of no borders and that means that everybody’s incomes will go down and we’ll have a few billionaires across the world.”Bachmann and Humphries point out that Clinton promised Goldman Sachs that she would deliver exactly that to her billionaire supporters. Bachmann continues, saying, “And the billionaires want to have a one world economic system and a one world political system, so that they get to call the shots and we lose essential freedoms that we’ve taken for granted for years.”“That’s the big difference in this election,” Bachmann says, “Donald Trump still believes in an old-fashioned America where we, the little people, get to vote and have our say. Hillary Clinton is completely different. She’s sold her soul essentially to the Goldman Sachs of the world and that’s who she dances to. And so that’s the difference in this election and it’s almost like another revolutionary war.”Bachmann challenges, “So it’s up to people like your listeners to make sure that they get out there, vote for Trump and do everything that they can to vote down ballot to make sure that we don’t lose this country.”Humphries asks what she says to people like John McCain and Paul Ryan who are coming out against Donald Trump. She probably doesn’t say exactly what she’d like to tell the two globalist members of Congress, as she wants to give them the opportunity to do the right thing. John McCain has come out in the past in support of the Muslim Brotherhood Clinton Aide Huma Abedin and against Bachmann. She’ll rise above it for now, but if we lose, McCain better hope he does too, so he can go hide somewhere in Arizona, out of reach of Bachmann and the American people. Same goes for Paul Ryan.Americans won’t take kindly to a couple of globalist traitors being responsible for the end of our nation or for the start of a shooting war as a last resort, to save it.

'Mumbai: Bollywood actor Varun Dhawan was trolled by Twitterati on Tuesday. It all began when Varun couldn’t vote for the BMC elections 2017 as his name was missing from the voter list and came out to issue his statement to the media.He said, “It’s upsetting that I couldn’t find my name on the voter list. My name has not shown up in the list unfortunately, it’s bizarre because I voted last year. Will find out from EC where is my name.”But the controversy has taken a bizarre turn as Varun has apologized for his comments and has said that last year he voted for the Big Boss candidates by sending a SMS. Due to the election season he was confused as to which voting was media referring to and that’s why he said he voted every year.',fake
'All over the country, we are seeing YUGE crowds with tens of thousands of people showing up at Donald Trump rallies.  More and more the mainstream media is trying to hide that fact.  Not only that, some of the more watched networks are cutting live feeds to the speeches in favor of covering bimbo eruptions that are being debunked left and right.As a feature of his presidential campaign, a posse of reporters and mainstream media operatives follows Donald Trump just like every other candidate.  At rallies and speeches, they are kept in a sort of bullpen set up for their needs with tables, phone lines, yada yada.This week, after some blatantly unfair, biased and downright slanderous coverage of Donald Trump, the crowd in Cincinnati, Ohio, let the fifth column of the fourth estate have it.  Watch this first hand account:For the people out on the fruited plain who are fretting after seeing poll numbers and other MSM psy-ops propaganda that the presidential race is close, this should be a bit gratifying, even if it is an InfoWars report.From an address in New Hampshire, October 15:Instead of being held accountable, Hillary is running for President in what looks like a rigged election. The election is being rigged by corrupt media, pushing completely false allegations and outright lies, in an effort to elect her President.But we are going to stop it. We are not going to back down. We are not going to let it happen. We are just getting started.Americans have had it with the years, the decades, of Clinton Corruption. They get rich stealing your jobs and shipping them to other countries.This will finally be the year the American people say: Enough is Enough.',fake
'ABC’s Martha Raddatz, so far in this election process, has a single claim to fame.  In the October 9 debate, she teamed up with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, and the Democratic Nominee for President, Hillary Clinton, to triple team Donald Trump.  Now, she has another notch on her belt as it were, in trying to take down Donald Trump.Not a comely woman by Fox News standards, and having a voice that sounds a lot like ground glass, Raddatz got to interview one of the most towering intellects in all of American politics, former Speaker of the House and Trump supporter Newt Gingrich, on Sunday morning , and shock of shocks, he wiped the floor with her.In the video below, it is quite obvious that Raddatz is overmatched.  She reads her questions from the desk, rather than memorizing.  She is not nimble in her interview technique.  She also has lame excuses for the mainstream media’s carrying on about a sex tape of men’s talk between Donald Trump and Billy Bush that swayed no Trump support away from him.  And then there was this:Martha Raddatz tries to mock the idea of election fraud, while Gingrich reminds her this country’s own history has proven fraud takes place. He also explains that without the media, Trump would be defeating Hillary Clinton by fifteen points and poised to win in a landslide.DC Whispers points out that Raddatz never denies Gingrich’s claims.  She just pussyfoots around the notion that anything about this election is rigged, when Trump and Gingrich, Project Veritas, Wikileaks, and bloggers all over the internet have been busy proving that it is rigged from top to bottom.',fake
'Time to add another felony to the list Hillary Clinton has already racked up.  Buried in the midst of the John Podesta email spill are the transcripts of some of her speeches.  Specifically, the ones that are problematic in this case, were given before Canadian bankers.  According to Catherine Herridge of Fox News, the speeches contained a lot of information that no one else would dare divulge.  She told them about how American intelligence found Osama bin Laden and then went in to kill him.Fox’s Herridge and Bill Hemmer talk it over in the segment below, and express complete disbelief that the Obama Administration is not in any way pressing charges.  In addition, when asked, one former Special Operations figure weighs in on how that community sees the investigation into the incident and the people who don’t seem to know how to keep their mouths shut.So, here we have a former Secretary of State telling a group of CANADIAN bankers about one of the most daring raids our Special Forces have carried out in recent memory – including intelligence gathering methods and details – during a paid speech, and the mainstream media is ignoring the story.Not only that, and this is what should stick in the craw of everyone who understands the concept of double standard, but the Navy SEAL who wrote about the mission and produced a best-selling book with the story must forfeit his earnings from the effort AND faces criminal prosecution for disclosing state secrets.Oh, hey, no double standard there.',fake
'Watch CNN: On Monday night Donald Trump held a rally in Wilkes-Barre, PA at the Mohegan Sun Arena. As he was critiquing the moderating at the 3 on 1 event in which he debated Hillary Clinton while fending off the two moderators, the crowd showed their solidarity with Mr. Trump and expressed their sincere feelings about the offending network.This wasn’t the typical Tupperware party or crappy, boring, “can’t give the damn things away, my publisher’s taking it in the shorts” book-signing sized groups of people like those that wander into or are paid to fill seats at Hillary Clinton events. This was a real crowd of close to ten thousand people, the kind Donald Trump draws everywhere he goes.The patriotic Trump supporters were none-too-pleased by the abusive treatment the American people’s choice for president was subjected to during the debate and they made it known. Trump told the crowd, “I’m telling you, they are so dishonest. Without the media, Hillary Clinton couldn’t be elected dog catcher.” He added, “CNN is a disgrace.” Dogs have a natural fear of ogres so Clinton has no chance of keeping a dog catcher position even if she were able to be elected.The Trump supporters agreed that CNN was horrible and made it known with chants of CNN Sucks. CNN could have avoided the situation and avoided the negative impact associated with their reputation being in the urinal by simply being objective journalists but that’s not going to happen. They don’t operate that way. Trump pointed out as the crowd was wrapping up their CNN appreciation cheer that the cameraman had turned his camera off while they were being addressed.The crowd also responded when Mr. Trump mentioned that some of the WikiLeaks emails now indicate that something could have been done at Benghazi, long the contention of those on the ground. The crowd responded with more boos and another chant, this one the familiar “Lock Her Up.”There’s a major difference between the number of supporters attending Trump rallies and those of the Democrat criminal candidate. The enthusiasm level and the identification with their candidate is markedly different as well. You’d almost think the claims that the race is tied are a complete fabrication. Supporters shout “CNN sucks” during @realDonaldTrump rally in PA @BreitbartNews pic.twitter.com/B7fimaFDlA— Alex Swoyer, esq.

'Plain and simply, Donald Trump is a master of mass communication.  That has become obvious as the 2016 presidential election season has progressed.  What few appreciate is what it took for him to get there.  Yes, there is natural talent involved, but over the decades, The Donald has honed that natural talent to a sharp edge.Part of that training, and something that added tremendously to his name recognition prior to throwing his hat in the presidential ring, was the number of Cameo appearances on television sit-coms and dramas and in movies over the years.  Thanks to YouTube channel CH2, we now have a compilation.Let’s see what we have here:Okay, so I skipped over professional wrestling.Still, though, some of the very people in the cameos where Donald Trump can be found are the celebrities who are dead set against the idea of his candidacy, and who will tell the world and any one else who will listen what a horrid man he is, and that they will be leaving the United States if he is elected.Uh-huh.For decades Donald Trump has been in the public eye and never before – not even when he was mingling with anyone who is anyone in Hollywood – have complaints against him been raised as they have in the last few weeks.  The accusations are beyond transparent, and are wearing very thin.Donald Trump gave a face to a movement that began years ago when the American people were betrayed by our leadership, and anti-American taxes and legislation were passed by Congress.  All along the way, we’ve been gaslighted and lied to by the mainstream media as well.  We get that.  The people in the swamp in Washington, D.C., do not want to admit that we know this.  Now is our time to make a statement that cannot be ignored.',fake
'Have you seen the National Enquirer today?  Me neither.  At least not yet.  But the cover story for the day is all about a man who, over the years, has been a “fixer” for the Clintons, a writer for the National Enquirer, and, it turns out a ghost writer for Tom Clancy.  His name is Jeff Rovin, and on Tuesday night, he went public on Sean Hannity’s prime time Fox News show to explain a few things.First off, Rovin does not like the term “fixer.” That’s not really what he saw himself doing.  As far as he was concerned, his job was to keep certain sources’ names out of the headlines.  Actors, actresses, limo drivers, food servers, maids, and more made up the network of informants. As far as this man was concerned, they were not the guilty parties.  They do not deserve to be exposed as the rocks are lifted off of the underbelly of America’s political class.Rovin also has the curious distinction of being one of the few people to say outright that politics and political reporting as we know it is a sordid business.  He claims that currently, the world of journalism is turned on its head: the National Enquirer is acting the part of the New York Times and vice versa.  Not only that, but the National Enquirer vets its stories well beyond what the mainstream media does.During this interview, Sean Hannity is his usual self, and most viewers want to take him by the lapels and say, “LET THE MAN ANSWER!”  However, the information that Rovin provides and the web of people at the top of the food chain who know each others’ secrets and keep their mouths shut in public is most curious.  Enjoy.Must be nice to be that libertarian about sex, but that’s sort of the way things have been in the corridors of power both here and elsewhere since the beginning of civilization.  And being able to separate personal feeling from work…that’s another matter.In one way, it is refreshing to know that there are people in the American journalism field who do recognize the hypocrisy and ironies for what they are.  Mr. Rovin is one of them.  Too bad this distance, on the surface at least, gives tacit approval to the immoral nature of the subjects involved.',fake
'There’s not much that drives Americans more insane than celebrities trying to prove their smarts only to make themselves sound REALLY stupid.  Take Robert De Niro for example.  The Raging Bull star is renowned in Hollywood for going the extra mile in preparing for new characters.  He’s the epitome of a professional when it comes to that.When it comes to recognizing smarts – street, book and otherwise – and knowing who really needs a punch in the mouth…not so much.De Niro, with his over inflated sense of self importance, decided to demonstrate his lack of recognition in the brains department by recording his own little rant and sending it to Megyn Kelly of Fox News.  And Megyn Kelly being an attention who herself, ACTUALLY PUT IT ON THE AIR!  Watch:It makes most Americans angry that this country has gotten to the point that it’s going to take a street gutter fighter willing to get his hands dirty and his hair messed up to straighten out the mess that the Washington, D.C., incest cesspool made of it.  Someone who is stupid isn’t going to punk the media like The Donald did on Sunday night.  (Brilliant move.)What is also maddening is when people like De Niro don’t see the evidence that those in charge are the ones who sent the country in the wrong direction in the first place.  And he thinks more of the same is going to change that?  That is insanity by definition.Those of us who do care about this country WILL be voting for it in November.  We will be voting for preservation of our way of life, restoration of lost liberties and rights, and stopping the rape of the nation in the form of government interference in the economy and commodities exploitation.  We will be sending a message, even if the effort fails, that we are not happy with the status quo.  We will also be repudiating all those “elites” who think of the little people as deplorable.As for who needs a punch in the mouth?  Why waste the time.  (Besides, I might break a nail.)',fake
'A homeless woman who could have mental issues, but demonstrated quite a bit of bravery anyway, parked herself over Donald Trump’s star on the Hollywood Boulevard Walk of Fame earlier this week after vandals took to it with a sledge hammer.  Images of her protecting the star went viral.  And then, just like the people who feel free to destroy property are wont to do in this election season, this happened:As of Friday evening, Michael Cohen, an Executive Vice President and Special Counsel to Donald Trump, put word out on Twitter, specifically appealing to Diamond and Silk for help, that Trump himself was looking for the woman.  He has something for her.Subsequent tweets implore anyone who finds the woman to contact him directly, not via the campaign. As Gateway Pundit points out, that means for Donald Trump, this is personal. The conversation went into the night with Mr. Cohen and the twitter community. There are people in Hollywood looking for the woman for Trump, and sooner or later she will be found.The reality is, though, that this incident is a microcosm of this election. Most Americans in liberal outposts – like the one where this writer lives – are afraid to actually publicly endorse Trump as a candidate. Lawn signs are stolen and burned. Cars get keyed or spray painted. Trump’s star got smashed. The opposition has no qualms anymore of respecting property, either public or private.And then to attack a woman, homeless or not, for expressing her thoughts – and the reality that with tens of millions of people living on the streets, even the homeless have competition from illegals – is plain and simply unAmerican. Whoever that woman is, and what ever her story is, she is still a human being and does not deserve to be beaten for saying things the Hillary cult doesn’t want to hear.',fake
'It’s really easy to get depressed in America these days.  After close to thirty years of destructive globalist policies taking hold in the government, our country is a mess.  Economically, the working middle class has been all but destroyed.  Jobs have left the country and have moved to places with lower corporate taxes and minimal environmental standards.  Junk is imported from overseas at dirt cheap prices thanks to what amounts to no tariff.  We are awash in debt at every level of society and government.  And to add insult to injury, the echo chamber that is the bought and paid for mainstream media is running victory laps for the presidential candidate who represents the people who did this to us – before the election.  (Yes, it’s a deliberate attempt to demoralize the Trump train.)Honestly, it’s not an easy time to be an American.  Those of us who support the candidate who best represents traditional American-style capitalism are targets for vandalism and hatred by those who oppose him.  Those who oppose the man are caught in endless echo chambers of “journalists” who have set themselves up as “experts” in a culture that surrendered critical thinking to them.  There is no escaping the circular arguments and endless sniping with friends and family who will quit one’s presence at the first provocation.Honestly, this country is a wasteland of nothing but fruitless arguments and “educated” useful idiots demonstrating the definition of insanity.  Other people in the world have seen this situation before.  They live in the lands that our ancestors left behind, and many of them are right with us in the fight against globalism and “leaders” who have anything but the best interests of their people at heart.  They are in the same place we are without free speech and largely without the right to bear arms.One man, the leader of the People’s Party of Belgium, is fighting the same fight as Americans against globalism.  In one way, his fight is ours and ours is his.  This is his latest message to the people of America.This is a reminder to go to the polls and vote against globalism no matter what the mainstream media has to say.  Our Waterloo awaits.',fake
'A portion of a dam in Bhagalpur’s Kahalgaon came down crashing hours before it was to be inaugurated by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar.The dam built at an estimated cost of Rs 389.31 crore is part of the ambitious Gateshwar Panth Canal Project which was planned to improve the poor land irrigation system in the region. But Nitish Kumar is not the one who thinks negative about every situation. Even the Dam collapse has been seen in a positive light be him.According to Nitish Kumar, the dam collapse happened at the right time as it will save the money which was to be wasted on the inauguration of the dam. Every year Crs of Rs is spent on events planned to launch those projects. According to Nitish, today’s incident will serve as a reminder to the ministers that even nature doesn’t want a politician to keep on inaugurating new projects and wasting money.Faking News reporter spoke to Nitish ji and he had this to say,” Look media presents everything in bad light. What if the dam collapsed. Should we just start crying and passing on blame from one person to another? This is a time for introspection. This is the sign given to us by mother nature that please don’t spend money on the inauguration of projects, instead, that money should be used to feed the poor.The Bihar government has immediately cancelled all events planned across the states to launch various schemes. The money saved will be used to implement more schemes for the poor.

'Paul Ryan is a despicable traitor to our nation, the Republican Party and to the American people. He is a fraud, at best one possessing the integrity of Judas Iscariot, though that is arguably a standard he falls well short of.  He is an employee of those working to destroy this nation for their own materialistic enrichment and expansion of power. He works for the same people Hillary Clinton is working for and towards the same destructive, anti-American objectives. He is a tool of the globalists who never supported Donald Trump.We all witnessed the contortions Weasel Ryan went through during the primary in his attempt to position himself as the alternative to Donald Trump during a brokered convention. He was one of the team of puppets that included John Kasich, Mitt Romney and Calgary Ted Cruz who were acting to subvert the system, who talk party unity while working against it, ready to be inserted by the power brokers once they were able to orchestrate an opening.The ambush bus video release and whatever else may yet be unveiled by the filthy shadow government puppeteers was designed to be the crack through which a successful revolt was engineered and one of these puppets, owned by the enemy of a free and prosperous America, would be placed into power. It would be a return to the normal politics of late, a slow circling of the drain as America is stripped of our wealth and identity. We would once again be given the mirage of a choice rather than the freedom to choose.But it didn’t work and now the sleazy little rodent, Paul Ryan, is left further exposed for what he is. He, like his fellow traitor and globalist tool, Senator Mike Lee, tried to create momentum for Americans to turn our backs on our future, on our children and on our nation, and to surrender to their power play. It’s the hand their masters gave them to play although they are not victims. Ryan, Lee and his ilk are opportunists setting themselves up for the devil’s rewards.Having failed in his effort to pull the rug out from under Mr. Trump by his impressive debate performance and the wake of a Hillary Clinton meltdown under the heat of a spotlight of Trump directed scrutiny, the traitor, Weasel Ryan, now has publicly once again taken the position that he has always truly held. He won’t support Mr. Trump. The reality is he never has; he’s just going through a cycle in which he’s not trying quite so hard to pretend that he’s not a turncoat.In a Monday morning conference call the establishment shill, who was placed into power by the Chamber of Commerce and other global fascist interests over the objections of those who knew what we were getting, made it official.  The New York Times reports that Weasel Ryan informed those on the call “that he would never again campaign alongside Mr. Trump and would dedicate himself instead to defending the party’s majority in Congress, according to five lawmakers who participated in the call and spoke on condition of anonymity.”Ryan is attempting to save face following his failed coup and to pick up the pieces that he and his establishment anti-Trump operatives have created as they work to destroy the Republican Party and devolve the American political system into what it effectively is already, a one party system under the boot of the establishment oligarchs. They’ll all call themselves Democrats one day soon, at a point when it’s already a foregone conclusion and irreversible by their estimation.By then the globalist invasion of America by the Mexicans, Central Americans and Islamists will be complete and our country will exist in name only. Ryan’s current charade, along with Mr. Lee and Mitt Romney, is the likely outgrowth of the “Romney Summit” back in June in Park City Utah.None of these globalist traitors ever intended to support Mr. Trump or gives a damn about party unity or the future of our nation beyond what’s in it for them and their puppeteers. That truth is becoming painfully obvious. The solution is a little more elusive but it still begins with one important and critical event. The election of Donald J. Trump as president of the United States.Then the purge.

'WH Spokesliar: Obama doesn’t think we’re entitled to answers or the truth, our non-elite little peasant minds couldn’t handle it. We’re deplorable rednecks and as such he must be very careful in dispensing what we’re allowed to believe. We also shouldn’t trust what we hear with our ears or see with our lying eyes. Obama and Clinton will provide our proper programming at the appropriate time; they’ll tell us what to believe.Obama’s spokesliar and information filter, Josh Earnest, warned the fragile and impressionable American people not to accept the truth about the regime’s voter fraud and racketeering that was revealed in the Project Veritas videos. He said they should be taken “not just with a grain of salt but maybe even a whole package of salt.” Wow, they must be just packed with lies; please show us where they are Mr. Earnest and thank you for protecting us.Earnest is in a tough spot. He can’t dispute the indisputable evidence, the admissions of criminal election fraud and mob tactics being used against Americans supporting Donald Trump. He did what Democrats often do when the news is damaging or unpleasant, he attacked the messenger. Earnest said, “Despite what the name might suggest, these videos have not often revealed the truth.”So we are apparently to believe that the two goons forced out by the revelations, their own admissions on hidden video, quit because they were exposed as liars? If that were a cause for firing Democrats, Mr. Trump would be running unopposed. They were forced out because they’ve been caught committing some very serious crimes and implicated the entire Democrat Party machinery. That includes the current criminal candidate, Hillary Clinton, as well as the occupier of the White House, Hussein Obama.One of the goons who was engaged in voter system racketeering, Bob Creamer, visited the White House 342 times over the period of time it has been befouled by Obama’s presence. Are we to assume they were also just talking about Bill Clinton’s golf game and grandkids? Creamer admitted he was inciting violence and committing fraud in the videos. Could that have been at the direction of the community organizing radical sitting with his feet propped up on the people’s Oval Office desk?Earnest didn’t want to comment on the video specifics, which is understandable since he might have to get into details that would implicate the White House and Clinton, but said the idea of initiating or provoking confrontations and violence at an opponent’s campaign is contrary to the Obama community organizing methodology. It’s too bad it never occurred to him to mention his strong morality convictions to the “head thug” during one of those 342 visits.Earnest said, “We shouldn’t have to resort to violence and in fact it is completely inappropriate to resort to violence to advance a political goal.” Earnest called it a principle that ‘president’ Obama “strongly believed in.” What Obama strongly believes in is using every means possible, as Alinsky taught him, “the end justifies the means,” as long as he doesn’t get caught, Josh. That’s his principle that was violated.Earnest encouraged those who view the videos to exercise, “extreme caution,” saying, “Time and time and time again, the information that was released by this organization was a lot different than initial reports would indicate.” Was there a denial in there, Earnest? Surely he’s going to provide us with a sampling from all of those inaccurate reports.In what was a de facto admission that he doesn’t have a lie that will make the problem of a direct connection between the two thugs and Obama go away, Earnest dodged a question about why Creamer had visited the White House 342 times and met with Obama 47 times.He was asked to explain the nature of the relationship between the two Democrat criminals, Obama and Creamer. He replied, “I’m not sure that I can describe it, because, I’m not sure there is much of one.” If you meet with someone 47 times, you have a relationship although it may be shady, criminal and conspiratorial, it’s still a relationship.

'Now that we’re there and the American public is FINALLY voting, we are starting to see exit polls pop up as conducted by media outlets.  One such poll, Morning Consult/Politico, was released early on election day and was conducted among early voters starting October 18.  Among the 6,782 people polled, their hearts’ desire was not a great economy, or a candidate that shared their values.  Nope.  It was more simple than that.Imagine that.  After eight years of a metrosexual in the White House who made one mess on the International Stage after another whether the media reported it that way or not, the American people want a strong leader.  Go figure.Asked what characteristic is most important for the next president, 36 percent of voters say they want a “strong leader,” 29 percent want “a vision for the future,” 16 percent want someone who “cares about people like me” and another 16 percent said they want someone who “shares my values.”The percentage of voters thus far who say they want a strong leader – a characterization Donald Trump’s team made central to his campaign – is twice the percentage who said they were looking for a strong leader in the 2012 National Election Pool exit poll.Okay, the readers say, we get it.  Americans want a strong leader.  What’s the big deal?  Well, the big deal is the rest of the touchy feely questions asked of the voters.  (Are all of these media polling sorts stuck in PMS mode?)Yes, the people are angry.  This particular question was couched in the context of how one feels about the negative vibes during the course of the campaign (something that was being fed incessantly by the mainstream media itself), but not in terms of what has been done to the country as a whole by the government in the last few decades.No, that concept, how do the people feel about their economic and living situations this election year, is expressed thusly.And no one seemed to think it significant that the MOST telling stat – that fewer people polled said that their situation was BETTER today than four years ago – was the one worth touting.Voters are less enthusiastic about the country’s financial situation. More than four in 10 (44 percent) said the country’s finances are worse off today than four years ago, compared with one-third who said it’s better and one-fifth (21 percent) who said it hasn’t changed much.Again, Republicans (71 percent of whom say the country is worse off) were much more likely to take a negative view of the country’s finances than Democrats, 22 percent of whom said the same. Only a quarter (22 percent) of independents think the country’s finances are in better shape, while almost half (48 percent) said the U.S. was worse off.Note that the individual is ignored here.  Just the mood of the country is explained.But still, the idea of Americans wanting a strong leader was a shock to the people conducting the poll. After decades of masculinity attacked in the news and entertainment media, it is refreshing to see.',fake
'In a true case of journalism is the rough draft of history….On Sunday, a “state sponsor” or “state actor” hacked into the Wikileaks apparatus and cut off access from the boss to his people.  This, apparently, triggered some sort of command for a “dead man’s switch” or code or, according to Gizmodo, file hashes, to be used in such an event which was broadcast to the world via Twitter.  For people sophisticated enough in matters of code and internet speak, the links were recognized for what they were: proof that the original email files were not tampered with, and what to watch for when the email drops actually happen.“Pre-commitment” in this case is a references to a cryptographic scheme to prevent unreleased information from being tampered with. Essentially those unique codes are proof to anyone reading the documents in the future that their contents remain unchanged: alteration to the leaks will likewise alter those 64-character codes. There were three codes given with three different subject matters:AGAIN: THE FILE HASH WILL CHANGE IF THE FILES ARE TAMPERED WITH.Naturally, given the state of heightened paranoia about Assange who is hiding out in the Ecuadorian embassy in London because he’s a wanted man in almost every other western country, this was interpreted as him being dead.  After all, the rumor, thanks to emails posted online by Wikileaks from various Clinton machine staffers, is that Hillary would like to see him droned.What didn’t help, was the immediate online dialog of “worst case scenarios” and rumors on Reddit feeds that claimed there was all sorts of police at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London to seize the man which turned out not to be true.  Those rumors are persisting, though, with some even saying that United Kingdom is taking back the land, and has arrested Assange.  With no live footage of this, there is no way to know for sure from the western side of the pond.  However, one Reddit user on this thread insisted that he did witness some police activity that subsided after a short amount of time.You’d think given the amount of grief almost every western nation has been given by this man, if he was captured or killed it would be at the top of every news cast.  Word is that there is D-Notice in place in jolly old England, meaning the media cannot report on the incident if it happened.  That is not confirmed beyond commenters on online boards. Also not confirmed, is that a Wikileaks volunteer has visited Assange in the Ecuadorian Embassy and has proof of life.What IS perfectly clear from the information known to the public is that Assange and Wikileaks are slowly dribbling out very damaging information hacked, and subsequently “stolen” from Clinton operative John Podesta’s gmail account.  They claim they are saving the best for last, and there is no reason not to believe them given some of the bombshells we’ve seen so far.  With a regime operating inside the United States that seems to stop at nothing to be sure their plans are carried out – Clinton Body Count, anyone – finding a way to neutralize Assange in the cards is not implausible.What is NOT perfectly clear, is what “state actor” or “state party” did the severing.  The U.S. government, and the Clinton machine have been blaming the Russian government for all of the leaking, claiming that Wikileaks is a front for Russian intelligence.  Assange has denied this, and various bloggers who know about bouncing signals off of internet gateways claim that hacking originates elsewhere.  As of this writing, no specific “state party” has been named as the guilty entity.At this point, all we can do is sit and wait for the next shoe to drop.  With the dead man’s switch activated and the code or file hash sent to whoever is next in the chain, Wikileaks and the bombshells will go on.  It’s not like the brainiacs in Assange’s stable didn’t plan for something like this coming.',fake
'Contrary to popular belief that social media and messaging apps have had only negative impact on society and are cause behind growing number of divorces in India, Whatsapp, the revolutionary messaging service on mobiles, may have had a major social impact in India, according to a new survey. But how?Earlier, wives would often call their husbands in the office several times during the day, and the phone would often go ringing. The husband would say later he was busy. But many times, wives suspected if he was lying. Their over-imaginative minds would lead them to think their husbands were having a affair in the office, hence unable to take her call. The result – the wife would eventually file for divorce, and the marriage would break. The same happened the other way too, as husbands calling wives who worked in office, often felt suspicious if the wife did not pick up the phone and later said she was busy.However, Whatsapp messaging has helped the communication between husbands and wives, by making it very convenient and trackable. It is convenient because the person can type a quick reply even if he or she is busy in a meeting. The lack of communication for being unable to take a call, is now replaced with a convenient communication flow on whatsapp. Secondly, it is trackable because the sender can see when the recipient was last online on whatsapp and if he or she has read the message. So only if there is a gap in their reply despite the recipient being online can the sender suspect, else in other cases they will not. At least it reduces the number of suspect cases, whereas earlier it was occuring almost every time.',fake
'Ever wonder why you aren’t seeing any pro-Trump advertising from the Republican National Committee on television?  The answer is very simple.  There isn’t any.  And there isn’t any because the RNC made the decision to focus their efforts “downstream” claiming that television advertising is a waste of money, they are investing in the ground game, and asking the better positioned campaigns and Super-PACs to make the effort.  From Politico:In 2004, the committee spent $18.2 million on independent expenditures — or IEs, in campaign parlance — boosting George W. Bush’s reelection bid. In 2008, the RNC’s IE spending surged to $53.5 million in support of John McCain’s campaign against Barack Obama. And in 2012, the RNC spent $42.4 million on IEs boosting Mitt Romney or opposing President Obama — with nearly 80 percent of the spending occurring before mid-October.By contrast, this cycle the RNC has spent only $321,000 on independent expenditures attacking Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. And all of that spending occurred last fall — before Trump had emerged as the leader for the GOP presidential nomination.This has some pro-Trump Republicans working for the Super-PACs and in other capacities a little riled.“The Democrats have an unprecedented and lopsided advertising advantage in this race like we have never seen before, and it is having a serious and negative effect,” said Curt Anderson, a former RNC political director who is helping a pro-Trump super PAC, Rebuilding America Now. “It is possible that Trump has sealed his fate at this point, but it is still a terrible mistake not to have $50 million of advertising from the Republican Party exposing Hillary Clinton and keeping her numbers down,” said Anderson, who helped to lead the RNC’s independent expenditure effort in 2004 and 2008.Given the desperateness of the Clinton campaign tactics this week, and the reality that Trump is now up in the RIGGED polls, let alone the honest ones, that advantage might not be for much, but the end result remains to be seen.However, the people at the RNC have a point: the groups with the unlimited dollars are better positioned to spend on television advertising since the rates are lower for them.  That does not change the poor optics for the party itself when the supporting cast downstream started jumping off the presidential candidate’s ship with the first story that challenged the supposedly tenuous hold he has on women voters.  (Most of us aren’t so immature as to fall for obvious political sabotage.)So, now we know.  The Republican National Committee is really letting Trump run on his own.  Way to rally behind the candidate.',fake
'Regular readers of this blogger know that she sits about six miles from Ferguson, Missouri.  It’s a bit up the road and through a few slums from here, but not so far away that in August of 2014, during the Michael Brown thing, we didn’t hear all the sirens.This week, the fair city of St. Louis, Missouri, is in the news for a different confrontation: the second presidential debate.  It is due to take place this evening in the brand spanking new field house that is, almost literally, down the street at Washington University…in St. Louis.  (Forgot.  The current chancellor is a pain in everyone’s back side about “in St. Louis.” We natives and alumni still call the place “Wash U.”)Without giving away too much about the neighborhood, and just where the seat is where this writer is typing away, this part of town is plain and simply upper middle class.  In a metro region known for its private neighborhoods, just about everyone lives in one.  Some of us are in gated communities, too.  Most of what is around here was laid out and built for the most part before World War II.  This pushes traffic to the main streets which have been there since horse and buggy days (many are narrow), and one little disturbance in the force…you get the idea.Into this tightly packed place comes a presidential debate, mainly due to the involvement of a local political family, the Danforths, and the speed and efficiency with which the city pulled off the last minute one in 1992 at the same location.  After living with this…crap…for a week, we the people are more than ready for it all to be over.  See, one of the main arteries of traffic from north to south has been cut off in a part of town where there are no others.Officially, road closures did not start until Saturday.  Unofficially, a vital stretch of street that runs right next to the field house has been a mess of arriving tractor trailers all week.  Sitting and waiting fifteen or twenty minutes for one to back onto Francis Field was nothing.  As of Saturday, the people living in the $500,000+ houses in the blocks across the street are fenced in.  The only way out is a small street that runs through the middle of that section.  One member of the church choir who lives two doors away from the street along the field hosue said there were semis AND impenetrable fences across the openings.  This morning on the way home from church, police were directing traffic and checking IDs of the people who lived in the neighborhood.Due to the road blockages, MANY of us have been taking detours all week.  To church, the grocery store, Walmart, you name it.  We’re not completely cut off, but as the hour approaches, more and more is going to be blocked off.  As of this writing, two east-west streets are blocked cutting of access to several churches on this lovely Sunday.Also disruptive in this whole mess:And that doesn’t count closing off the highways to get the candidates in from the airport.  Or the helicopters once it all starts rolling.  After it’s over, the sirens….This is what happens around here when the debate comes to town.  We do this on a regular basis.  Security for this particular one is so over the top, though, that we who can walk to the campus can’t even take pictures from across the street.  The brand new grass that was put in on the field is now covered with trailers, tents, and satellite trucks.  The field lights have been augmented.  (It’s a regular college football field where the 1904 Olympic track and field events took place.) It’s plain and simply disruptive, and the schedule of when the roads will be open again changes by the hour.',fake
'Bill Whittle debates Hillary Clinton, leading off with her statement from the first presidential debates with Donald Trump that she has put forward a plan to defeat ISIS. She could have more accurately phrased it as a plan to fix the mess she’s made, as her ideas for dealing with the Middle East in virtually any regard ultimately is.She said, “Our military is assisting in Iraq and we’re hoping within the year to be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then really squeeze them in Syria.” Whittle responds, “Hillary, while you continue to hope to squeeze them in Syria, ISIS is busy murdering people in Paris and Brussels and Orlando and San Bernardino. And almost every week because of you innocent people are dying.He says, “They’re dying because of you. You created ISIS, you and ‘president’ Obama, because when ‘president’ Obama took office, ladies and gentlemen, back in 2009, Iraq had been stabilized and there had not been a single American killed in Iraq for five months.”“But you, as Secretary of State,” he continues, “were unable or more likely unwilling, to conclude a simple status of forces agreement with Iraq. I say unwilling, Mrs. Clinton, because we have damn near a hundred of these things with countries all around the world. However, you and the ‘president’ announced that we would be leaving the Iraqis all alone and within a very short period the defeated, scattered, rag tag remnants of what had once been AQI, al-Qaeda in Iraq, which had been defeated, utterly destroyed by American troops during the Iraq War, you let them become ISIS.”Whittle says, “And worse than that, you could have stopped them at any time. But you and the ‘president’ didn’t because you couldn’t face the political humiliation of putting boots back on the ground in Iraq after you took credit for pulling them out. And they grew and they grew and they grew, because you created them, by not leaving troops in Iraq.”“It’s not such a bad idea, Mrs. Clinton,” Whittle reminds her, “we’ve had US troops stationed in Europe for sixty years. And we’ve had troops stationed in Korea for a little over fifty years. And you refused to do it for five.”He moves on to her adventurism in Libya, saying, “You launched an unauthorized war in Libya. You armed and have had American aircraft fly air cover for al-Qaeda. You may remember al-Qaeda from your appearance fifteen years ago in lower New York.”Whittle says, “Oh, and your husband, by the way, had at least one chance to kill Osama bin Laden before the attack but he declined on the advice of White House lawyers. I think we’ve had enough lawyers in the White House for a while.”He can’t help pointing out the toy she gave the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, a reset button on which they translated the word “reset” incorrectly. It’s just another embarrassing failure from the regime that has made that their legacy.He points out that if Clinton is given the chance, “the same catastrophes would start to occur right here at home.Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'KANPUR: Was it destined to be so? Why do royals die an isolated death? What we go through in the news-item with the heading, ‘a lonely death for the last prince of Oudh, the police finds the body near palace’ dated November 7, 17 is painfully awful? Prince Riaz Oudh died the way he lived alone and forgotten. He appeared to have passed an abandoned pitiful life after his sister’s death in the broken Malcha Mahal which was raised by Firozshah Tughlaq in the jungles of Delhi. What had been constructed for gratifying hunting habit ended in a dwelling place for a penniless prince? He came to this stone structure in 1985 along with his mother and sister Sakina. His mother had died prior to his sister’s death before September, ‘17 as the reports said. That prince was descendant of Awadh Nawab Wajid Ali Shah whose razzle-dazzle can never be overlooked.It was quite strange that a progeny of that opulent Nawab was living in a pitiable condition. He used to ask people for food and one person of the locality would feed him. He would wander near the forests in Chankyapuri. A distant relative from Aligarh would visit him every few years. Some descendants of the Nawab was said to have been lived in Matiya Burj of Kolkata but their relationship with the prince did not seem to stand. Nawab did find mention more often but his progenies are forgotten in the wilderness? Likewise, we hear of the descendants of Tipu Sultan living in penury while the king is much in the news these days. Similar stories were heard about the Mughal descendants whose ancestors lived royal lives. The regal families’ fall is so scary as to compel them to such an extent. Were their privy purses not stopped, they would have lived a normal life?',fake

Kuch to gadbad hai,” said Ramola.“I am the creator of my problems. Was mad when I opened so many bank accounts needlessly just by looking at the freebies they offered like movie tickets, Pizza coupons etc. Gone to SBI some four times, whenever I went there the concerned person is always out like he has gone for breakfast, tea or lunch.”Pradeep added, “PAN and Aadhaar ka link to mat bolo. Online it said your name does not match with records. First I ran towards Income tax office for PAN correction where they asked for Aadhaar with correct name and when I went to Aadhaar office they asked for PAN with correct name. Kuch hua to nahin, mera bata chapal hi ghis gaya, now I am using liberty”.Pradeep said, “Now Ramola does not know about all these. She does not know I have some sixteen sim cards with different service providers in my name, some I have bought for her and her family members in my name as they did not have ID proofs. If my mobile or her mobile gets locked, she will doubt on me more, kuch to galat kar raha hai yeh banda.”Pradeep said, “Private banks are no good either.

'A WikiLeaks email that was part of the most recent batch from Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta includes information that indicates that while Clinton and her aide Cheryl Mills claim to be too lame-brained to understand the significance of a “C” designation on classified emails, they’re not too dense to realize that documenting the fact that Hussein Obama knew all about her illegal email account and gave at a minimum tacit approval is not such a great idea. Not for those residing on the criminal side of the equation, anyway.\r\nIn an email chain that surfaced, much of the entire Clinton leadership team is seen scrambling to hide the documentation that would prove what we all already know, that Obama is a pathological liar. In this case it is proven by virtue of the his correspondence with Hillary Clinton on her illegal server.\r\n\r\nThe conflict arises from a statement by Obama that, as was so often the story the “out of the loop” Obama used, he just learned of Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email server and account to conduct State Department business on the television news.\r\nThe message was an alert from the same Clinton insider who was videotaped feeding propagandist Andrea Mitchell a question on the Clinton plane following the third debate, Nick Merrill. He’s informing Jen Palmieri, the Clinton communications director, that Obama is busted if any of those emails surface.\r\nCampaign boss, Podesta gave orders, “We need to clean this up.” That’s Democrat or Clinton speak meaning it’s time to engage in their standard operating procedure of obstruction, obfuscation and cover up.

'Back when Hussein Obama first befouled the White House, many naive Americans still gave him the benefit of the doubt in both his honesty and his declaration that he was a Christian. He’s since been revealed as a pathological liar and as a racist white-hating Muslim agitator, but he was operating under a much more stealthy strategy which was moderately effective at masking his destructive goals at the time. WikiLeaks has since made some things much clearer.\r\nThere were those who knew what he was up to, but their silence had been purchased. One such individual was Preeta Bansal, who may or may not share Obama’s personal characteristics and goals but certainly did nothing to expose his. She was one of the first of innumerable foreigners to be given high positions within the Obama regime, being a naturalized Indian. Obama has frequently used those with the weakest of ties to traditional America as his agents of fundamental transformation and anti-white, anti-American prejudice.\r\n\r\nAs the WikiLeaks leaked Podesta email reveals, Bansal was engaged not only in racist employment discrimination, but religious discrimination against Christians in the recommendation and review process for potential new hires within the executive branch. That’s the kind of thing that Loretta Lynch and her bulldog DOJ “Civil Rights” Deputy Vanita Gupta would be all over if it were to happen to a Muslim or non-white. Discriminating against whites and Christians is just “who we are” under this racist America-hating Islamist.\r\nOne thing that is important to remember is that this compilation of Muslim and Asian candidates for preferential employment treatment would not have been prepared without it being specifically requested by the inner circle within the Obama administration.

One such individual was Preeta Bansal, who may or may not share Obama’s personal characteristics and goals but certainly did nothing to expose his. She was one of the first of innumerable foreigners to be given high positions within the Obama regime, being a naturalized Indian. Obama has frequently used those with the weakest of ties to traditional America as his agents of fundamental transformation and anti-white, anti-American prejudice.As the WikiLeaks leaked Podesta email reveals, Bansal was engaged not only in racist employment discrimination, but religious discrimination against Christians in the recommendation and review process for potential new hires within the executive branch. That’s the kind of thing that Loretta Lynch and her bulldog DOJ “Civil Rights” Deputy Vanita Gupta would be all over if it were to happen to a Muslim or non-white. Discriminating against whites and Christians is just “who we are” under this racist America-hating Islamist.One thing that is important to remember is that this compilation of Muslim and Asian candidates for preferential employment treatment would not have been prepared without it being specifically requested by the inner circle within the Obama administration. Race-based preference was to be given and discrimination against those who were not Muslim or Asian was to be engaged in. Being Arab alone wasn’t enough to get you onto the good list. Bansal specifically states that Arab Americans who were not Muslims were not included.\r\nShe also acknowledges that she included high profile Muslims even though she believed they would not survive the vetting process due to the attention they would receive from bloggers.

'It finally happened. A true, honest to goodness easy to understand smoking gun popped up in one of the WikiLeaks John Podesta email caches.  This one came in WikiLeaks drop number 25, but here it is.It just so happens that the date of the email above was March 2, 2015 – the same day that the New York Times published a story titled, “Hillary Clinton Used Personal Email Account at State Department, Possibly Breaking Rules.”  Imagine that.  What this means could be anyone’s guess, but the reality is that when questioned about “intent” and the destruction of emails that would prove either that Barack Obama and company knew Hillary Clinton was using a personal email or that all of those emails that were destroyed by BleachBit were part of some cover up.  That at least points to intent, if not proves it.  Remember, lack of intent is what is being used as the excuse to NOT prosecute Hillary Clinton for any of her crimes.What is also intriguing in this exchange, and one adjacent to it in the full universe of Podesta emails, is the mention of “Lanny.” It is suggested that “Lanny” is Lanny Davis, Bill Clinton’s personal counsel.  From Zero Hedge:Furthermore, a search for Lanny Davis reveals the following curious exchange between Robby Mook and John Podesta from March 8, 2015, just days after the above mentioned exchange, in which Mook saysIt seems the Clinton campaign was not happy with being set on a course of transparency by Bill Clinton’s special counsel.That would be an understatement if the purpose of getting rid of the emails was to cover up their existence. As it was at the time, the White House press people were busy not denying any of this happening.Is this enough to put the final torpedo in the hull of the SS Hillary?  Maybe not. But it is a definite step in the right direction.',fake
'WikiLeaks Clinton Goldman Sachs Speeches – Golden Years As Wall St SenatorHillary Clinton’s version of confession is when she goes before Goldman Sachs or their fat cat equivalent and actually tells something resembling the truth. We thought she didn’t have it in her because, as members of the public and the American people that she so loathes, it’s something we haven’t previously been exposed to.The latest WikiLeaks release from Friday included an email from Clinton Campaign Research Director Tony Carrk, dated 01/23/2016 with the subject of Goldman Sachs paid speeches. The email was a collection of portions of three speeches Clinton gave to her financiers at Goldman Sachs. Below are two excerpts from a speech on October 24th, 2013.Clinton said, “And with political people, again, I would say the same thing, you know, there was a lot of complaining about Dodd-Frank, but there was also a need to do something because for political reasons, if you were an elected member of Congress and people in your constituency were losing jobs and shutting businesses and everybody in the press is saying it’s all the fault of Wall Street, you can’t sit idly by and do nothing, but what you do is really important.” [GS2, 10/24/13]Clinton said, “I represented all of you for eight years. I had great relations and worked so close together after 9/11 to rebuild downtown, and a lot of respect for the work you do and the people who do it, but I do — I think that when we talk about the regulators and the politicians, the economic consequences of bad decisions back in ’08, you know, were devastating, and they had repercussions throughout the world.” [GS2, 10/24/13]Like an Albatross, bad decisions follow Clinton wherever she goes.Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'Americans can be forgiven for believing that WikiLeaks was a complete creation of Julian Assange.  In fact, it was not.  It was directed, at least, by Assange’s mentor, Gavin MacFadyen, a resident of the Pimlico District of London.  Mr. MacFadyen died on Saturday, October 22, 2016 in London.  He was 76.In the hours following his death, multiple tweets from Wikileaks expressed sadness at the man’s passing as well as accolades for his mentoring and journalistic integrity.The CIJ team also published an address from MacFadyen’s wife and member of Julian Assange’s Defense Fund, Susan Benn, who described her husband as a “larger-than-life person,” with gratitude and respect.“He was the model of what a journalist should be… He spearheaded the creation of a journalistic landscape which has irrevocably lifted the bar for ethical and hard-hitting reporting. Gavin worked tirelessly to hold power to account.“His life and how he lived it were completely in sync with the principles that he held dear and practiced as a journalist and educator – to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable,” Benn wrote.MacFadyen was the producer and director of more than 50 investigative journalism films.  He also was banned in his lifetime by the Soviet Union and South Africa’s apartheid.In his professional career, MacFadyen shed light on topics like child labor, pollution, the torture of political prisoners, neo-Nazis in Britain, UK industrial accidents, Contra murders in Nicaragua, the CIA, maritime piracy, election fraud in South America, South African mines, as well as many others. He worked on investigative television programs for PBS’s Frontline, Granada Television’s World in Action, the BBC’s Fine Cut, Panorama, The Money Programme, and 24 Hours, as well as Channel 4’s Dispatches.At this writing, MacFadyen’s cause of death is unknown. His wife posted a short-lived tweet saying that he passed away after a short illness.  That has been scrubbed from the online world.  Other writers have put forth information that better fits the suspicious timing of Mr. MacFadyen’s death.By the way, Batch #18 of the Podesta emails was released by WikiLeaks today.',fake
'The tactic of branding Donald Trump’s openness to dealing with Putin and his lack of prejudicial animosity for the Russians is seen as a weakness to be exploited by the Clinton warmongers in their efforts to distort who Donald Trump is and to discredit him by creating a relationship that doesn’t exist between him and Putin while masking their own web of entanglements.They also recognized the actual vulnerability of Hillary Clinton in her joint responsibility for the growth of ISIS and failures of her shared “strategy” with Hussein Obama for dealing with them.In one of the Podesta emails released by WikiLeaks, the following comments were made by political advisor Brent Budowsky to Podesta. It’s advice that an examination of the rhetoric indicates was acted upon by the Clinton campaign. He recommended:   “be careful about the U.N., support but don’t go too far. Putin did not agree to anything about removing Assad and continues to bomb the people we support. [Rebels, ISIS, Al-Nusra] We pushed the same position in 2012 (Geneva 1, which HRC knows all about) and Geneva 2 in 2014. Odds that Putin agrees to remove Assad are only slightly better than the odds the College of Cardinals chooses me to someday succeed Pope Francis.“Best approach is to slaughter Donald for his bromance with Putin, but not go too far betting on Putin re Syria.”“Does she really want to co-own the Obama-Clinton ISIS strategy?  She will never state what I believe we need to do—at least 20,000 ground troops with 3,000 American and at least 10,000 from Sunni Muslim nations— because she is consumed with keeping Obama’s goodwill and afraid of liberal backlash.  But at the least she should not be branding and infecting herself with Obama’s policy towards Syria and ISIS by offering such high and direct praise for it.”She does NOT want to run for Obama’s third term on ISIS and Syria to continue the Obama-Clinton policy against ISISThe best single move to elect her would be a massive voter registration and organization drive. Expand the electorate so more voters will vote so her low trust ratings generally will have less prorated impact, and the number of higher trust voters will be newly registered.There is no ad on earth that will increase her trust ratings or the enthusiasm of her voters the way a mega-registration project will increase her support on election day.  As for ISIS, the mathematically worst place for her to be is co-owner of the Obama-Clinton policy. Obama could destroy her candidacy the same way Democrats lost control of the House, the Senate, governorships and state legislatures during her presidency.  Things happen for a reason, and either change the reason or we will end up with the same outcome. BrentThe original email can be seen here.',fake
'There’s just too many loose ends in the rapidly unraveling web of corruption for the Democrat party criminals to be able to tie them all back up.

'Wikileaks, how did we ever have presidential campaigns without you?  On Monday, October 31, after one too many emails from Democratic National Committee’s acting chairwoman, Donna Brazile, sharing debate questions and information came to light via the John Podesta gmail cache, CNN took a machete to her suspended contract. Politico broke the story:CNN says it is “completely uncomfortable” with hacked emails showing former contributor and interim DNC chair Donna Brazile sharing questions with the Clinton campaign before a debate and a town hall during the Democratic primary, and has accepted her resignation.Hacked emails posted by WikiLeaks show Brazile, whose CNN contract was suspended when she became interim DNC chair over the summer, sharing with the Clinton campaign a question that would be posed to Hillary Clinton before the March CNN Democratic debate in Flint, and sharing with the campaign a possible question prior to a CNN town hall also in March.In a statement, CNN spokeswoman Lauren Pratapas said that on Oct. 14, the network accepted Brazile’s resignation.“On October 14th, CNN accepted Donna Brazile’s resignation as a CNN contributor. (Her deal had previously been suspended in July when she became the interim head of the DNC.) CNN never gave Brazile access to any questions, prep material, attendee list, background information or meetings in advance of a town hall or debate. We are completely uncomfortable with what we have learned about her interactions with the Clinton campaign while she was a CNN contributor,” Pratapas said.The dates do invite confusion as this formal separation was announced seventeen days AFTER the resignation was accepted, and the email leaks are listed as the reason for the final cords being cut.  Any number of scenarios could have been discussed, but it looks like the impropriety – and getting caught – was just too much for CNN.Donna Brazile, for her part, thanked the people of CNN for their collegiality during her tenure there.Can’t you, the reader, just hear what this woman has to say?',fake
'WikiLeaks : While the specific numbers vary between polls and the way the question is asked, most Americans want more, not less enforcement of our immigration laws and borders, with a majority wanting less immigration of any kind, legal or illegal. According to the Pew Research Center, 83\% of Americans want levels frozen where they are or reduced.Hillary Clinton couldn’t care less. She represents an extension and a compounding of the current abuse of power, in service to the special interests that are working to destroy our nation. One of those she serves in that regard is Goldman Sachs. She attempted to hide her speeches to that infamous banking institution, knowing full well that she was violating the wishes of the American people. As is often the case, Clinton failed, WikiLeaks got their hands on them and on Friday, released them to the world. They vividly illustrate just how little regard she has for the American people.In pressing for open borders, or “immigration reform” as it is referenced in Democrat code speak, She told executives at Goldman Sachs that Americans who want to limit immigration are “fundamentally un-American” in a speech given three years ago, in October of 2013.She said, “Immigration reform is so important,” as she demanded that Congress “get immigration reform done.” In this context she was referring to the gang of eight legislation of open borders RINOs McCain, Flake, Rubio and Graham.As noted by Breitbart, provisions of that bill included immediate amnesty and eventual citizenship to millions of illegal aliens, a doubling of the annual admission of foreign workers, and the dispensation of 33 million green cards to foreign nationals in the span of a single decade despite current record immigration levels. That figure alone represents a ten percent jump in the population of the United States.WikiLeaks revealed that Clinton thinks we patriots are not only deplorable and unredeemable, in Clinton’s increasingly bugged-out eyes, we’re obstructionists as well. She told the gathered bankers, “What I really resent most about the obstructionists is they have such a narrow view of America. They see America in a way that is no longer reflective of the reality of who we are. They’re against immigration for reasons that have to do with the past, not the future. They can’t figure out how to invest in the future, so they cut everything. You know, laying off, you know, young researchers, closing labs instead of saying, we’re better at this than anybody in the world, that’s where our money should go. They just have a backward-looking view of America. And they play on people’s fears, not on people’s hopes, and they have to be rejected. I don’t care what they call themselves. I don’t care where they’re from. They have to be rejected because they are fundamentally un-American.”She went on to further cheapen and demean our American citizenship and heritage, saying that we’re just an idea that anyone can have, that being “American” is not a national identity, but rather is “an intellectual invention.”She distorted the very definition of citizenship, saying, “American was an invention. It was an intellectual invention, and we have done pretty well for all these years. And these people want to just undermine that very profound sense of who we are. And we can’t let them do that. So it’s not just about politics or partisanship. It really goes to the heart of what it means to be American.”Maybe whatever destructive forces first led her to develop her liberal enlightened intellectualism have finally completely eaten away the remnants of her brain. America is not an intellectual invention anymore than Canada, Australia, Germany, Great Britain or even China or Russia are. We’re a nation. She’s attempting to smooth-talk her treachery to a point that isn’t a direct assault on our Constitution and treasonous. Failure awaits her at every turn.America is us, it’s our nation, it’s who we are. We do not exist for the pleasure or enrichment either the elite parasites within or their counterparts among the invading rabble. Mrs. Clinton is the one who is fundamentally and irrefutably, un-American.Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'Wikileaks: The Clinton campaign keeps telling the American people that Vladimir Putin wants Trump elected, and that he’s put his “Russian hackers” to work trying to sabotage Clinton on his behalf. The phantom operatives are as hard to find as evidence of global warming and the false claims that they are responsible are just as “certain.” They’re the ones who broke into the private systems, Clinton tells us it was they who revealed the Democrat’s serious misdeeds, statements and crimes to the public.Of course that line of thinking completely discounts the conflict of interest and complicity of the Clinton’s in the Uranium One deal in which they earned over $160 million for selling Russia rights to much of America’s Uranium production. It is also completely inconsistent with new information that was just released by WikiLeaks as part of Hillary Clinton’s Campaign Chairman John Podesta’s emails, the fact that he is on the executive board of an energy company, Joule Unlimited, “which received million from a Putin-connected Russian government fund.”Podesta also received 75,000 common shares of stock.  Trump has sworn that he has no business relationship with Mr. Putin or with Russia beyond one year that they hosted his beauty pageant. Obviously that is a statement that Mr. Podesta cannot make, or at least, not truthfully. It would appear that the Democrats are once again projecting their misdeeds onto their opponents as a diversion.The newly released email by Wikileaks is in the form of a forwarded message titled “Podesta Outstanding Docs for Joule.” Eryn Sepp, an assistant to Podesta at the Center for American Progress, forwarded it to Podesta from  Mark C. Solakian, a Senior Vice President and General Counsel at Joule Unlimited Technologies, Inc.It was otherwise a mundane bit of housekeeping, aside from the Russian connection now exposed. Slovakian wrote in the 2014 mailing, “It is my understanding that John transferred the resulting 75,000 common shares from the option exercise to the Leonidio LLC. As such, we would need to edit the Transfer of Share Agreement to reflect the transfer of 75,000 common shares to the LLC.”Donald Trump Senior Communications Advisor Jason Miller weighed in on the report, saying, “The disclosure that Clinton Chair John Podesta transferred his shares in Putin-backed Joule Unlimited to an anonymous holding company when he joined the Obama Administration is extremely concerning.“Because the holding company is completely anonymous, we do not know whether or not he still has deep financial ties to Vladimir Putin and his regime.” Miller added, “As such, Mr. Podesta needs to either reveal who is behind the holding company or he must resign from the Clinton campaign immediately.”Podesta was required by law to fully disclose his position on the Joule Unlimited board of directors and to make it part of his federal financial disclosures before taking his position as Hussein Obama’s senior adviser. He did not comply with those requirements which leads one to ask what else this international lobbyist and hustler is hiding from public knowledge. What about his candidate? What other international financial relations is she failing to report as well?Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I’d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'Now it’s REALLY official. 2016 is the most extraordinary election year ever. Not only are the candidates an unindicted criminal and an American who has actually done something in his life, but alternative media led by the secrets publishing Wikileaks, is driving the news narratives.One of the great mysteries of it all – where did WikiLeaks get all those emails that are so damaging to the Democrats – has been a matter of great speculation.  The Democrats themselves are blaming Russia.  Many people believed that Seth Rich was a source given the way he died.  (He may have been for all we know.)  There is evidence that for the John Podesta stash, anyway, a phishing link sent via Georgetown University was used.  According to one intelligence insider, none of this is accurate.Steve Pieczenik, a former colleague of Tom Clancy and writer of intricate spy novels given his background in the intelligence community now claims that the entire WikiLeaks effort was a coup of sorts to keep the Clintons out of the White House.  It was a group effort by many patriots within the United States Government who fed information to outlets like WikiLeaks and let it be known that they were not going to allow this country to be compromised any longer.Dr. Pieczenik, a psychiatrist, explained on his blog what was behind the effort, officially known as a counter-coup since the Clintons took over the government with one through a number of side deals.As a way of counter-acting the Clinton’s silent coup of corruption, these brave men and women of the IC have released a series of emails through Julian Assange and Wiki-Leaks which underscore the Clintons’ massive corruption attempts to take over our USG through the rigged electoral system.Usually, a military coup presents itself with soldiers in the street and tanks splayed out all over Washington DC and at other key communications points in the USA.This time around there was a new type of Counter-coup, an Info-Counter Coup using Wiki-leaks. Wikileaks disseminates the truth around the world, while at the same time making sure that the FBI Director, James Comey, opened up the Huma Abedin files with regards to national security violations….You are now witnessing a new type of American Revolution. The Clintons and Podesta initiated a silent coup to undermine the USG through corruption and co-optation of the elite political leaders. In turn, they were met by the by the silent counter-coup of our civilian/military Intelligence community. In the age of the internet, brave American warriors are everywhere. They monitor any internal/external attempts to undermine this great republic.Yes.  It looks like the FBI director succumbed to internal pressure.  It also seems that the mysterious disappearance of Michelle Obama’s Twitter feed was part of it.  How many other efforts by citizen journalists were part of the effort is another story.To add to his extraordinary blog post, Dr. Pieczenik put up a video on YouTube that has been picked up by Drudge and Alex Jones.If this is true, then Donald Trump’s claims that the system is rigged is an understatement.  Dr. P is essentially saying that the election was going to be stolen, and the patriots inside the government aren’t going to let that happen. They are revealing the corruption of the Clintons for all to see.The veracity of this claim is a little fantastic to believe, but there it is.  WikiLeaks seems to be getting information from inside the U.S. Government.  If that thought had not crossed many a mind, it would be dismissed by now.',fake
'Following the defection of senior Congress leader Rita Bahuguna Joshi, the party vice president Rahul Gandhi has decided to build a wall around the senior party leaders till the UP elections early next year.The key Congress leaders of the state will be basically confined to four walls of a room in an undisclosed location. They will be devoid of all communications except a hotline with the party headquarters.Rahul hopes this move will prevent the ongoing defection of the party leaders that included the likes of Himanta Biswa Sarma and Vijay Bahuguna to the rival Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) camp. According to sources, he also plans to visit the secret room from time to time to have lunch with those leaders like he does with voters during the election campaign.“Desperate times call for desperate measures,” a Congress worker told The UnReal Times on the condition of anonymity. “This is a proactive measure to stop the leakage of talent from Congress. You see this move should once and for all end the debate on Rahul ji’s leadership.”The Congress is quite relaxed about leaders using mobile phones from within the room to communicate with the outside world. They’re confident about the poor network connectivity of mobile phones in the remote areas of the state.“This is the only occasion when we want to thank the Samajwadi Party for the lack of development in the state,” added the Congress worker sarcastically.The BJP however is not really worried by the Congress’ stealthy move. The party president Amit Shah told The UnReal Times that the Congress leaders interested in joining the BJP need not worry as he can locate them successfully.“I don’t know where you’re. But I will find you and I will induct you in the BJP,” Shah said as he turned the GPS on in his mobile phone.(Originally published on Right to Laughter)',fake
'New Delhi: After starting a huge political storm with one of his tweets, cricketing legend Virender Sehwag has now agreed to tweet only under adult supervision. The tweet in question has started a Twitter war that is still going strong after 4 days. From ABVP, AISA to Freedom of Expression to Indian Army to Pakistan to Haryana to literacy of sports persons, the war has covered several phases during these past 4 days.The outrage started when Sehwag tweeted this tweet, which escalated after Bollywood actor Randeep Hooda laughed at this tweet.Speaking to Faking News, Sehwag said, “I just tweeted a joke, not a very good joke either, just like most of my jokes, but I had no idea that this will lead to such a huge uproar. I have tweeted several PJs earlier that deserved a bigger outrage actually but I guess life is unpredictable that way. Anyway, to stay safe in future, I will only tweet when I am supervised by an adult. Every tweet will be checked and rechecked multiple times before I click that send button.”“I have already decided that I will only tweet birthday wishes to cricketers now. They don’t get offended even if my birthday wish is a really lame poem. Still, to be on the safer side, I will be under adult supervision whenever I log on to Twitter”, Sehwag added.However, not everyone is convinced that Sehwag will listen to the person supervising him. “He never listened to me when Iw as the coach, fat chance that he will listen to any supervisor now”, said former Indian coach Gary Kirsten.',fake
'Jaipur: Ever since Sanjay Leela Bhansali announced his ambitious period drama ‘Padmavati’, it has been facing one protest after another from various groups. Though the production team has repeatedly clarified that they are not going to hurt anyone’s sentiments with the film, protesters haven’t budged and continued the protests against the film. One such protester, Sandeep Singh, has now said that he will lead a protest against the film after its release if the film fails to sufficiently offends me.“I have spent last year of my life protesting against the offensive content in the film. Now if I find there was nothing offensive at all in the film then I will look like a complete idiot, won’t I?” Sandeep said ,”I can’t let the producers make a fool out of me like that. I will launch an even bigger agitation and will not stop till they add an offensive scene or two. Of course then I will protest against those offensive scenes.”When asked why is he planning to watch the movie at all if he suspects some scenes may offend me, Sandeep said ,”Are you kidding me? Did you see the trailer, film mast banayi hai Sanjay ne, Dekhni to padegi. I have to check whether the film is offensive or not to our sentiments as well, don’t I?”Meanwhile, several groups from various parts of the country have now asked Sanjay Leela Bhansali to show them the film before release so that they can check whether the film has any offensive content or not before the film hits the cinemas. “Great chance to watch the film for free and even before first day, first show viewers so why not, we also applied”, said the member of once such group.',fake
'Mumbai: Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s period drama ‘Padmavati’ has attracted controversy ever since the film was announced by the filmmaker. Now after crossing many hurdles, the film is set for a release on 1st of December but its problems are still not over. The film is facing the threat of a boycott in states like Rajasthan, Gujarat and Haryana with Haryana minister Anil Vij calling for a ban on the film as well. In a desperate bid to get his filmr eleased without incident, Mr. Bhansali has now offered to add a scene in which Alauddin Khilji will stand for the Indian National Anthem in a bid to give a patriotic touch to the film.The film revolves around Alauddin Khilji’s attack on Chittor in a bid to get Rani Padmini who committed Jauhar along with the ladies of the Court to escape the Sultan from Delhi. The film has angered Rajput community in particular and several other communities in general. Even though Bhansali and the cast members have repeatedly said that the film will not offend anyone’s sentiments, there have been large scale protests against the film with even the politicians and royal families of Rajasthan joining in.Speaking to the media, Mr. Bhansali said ,”I have spent too much on making this film and have already paid all the actors and technicians so it is not possible for me to stop the release of the film. I can’t change the story either because if I don’t show Padmavati in Padmavati then what else will I show. Therefore, I decided to appeal to the nationalist sentiments of the people. National Anthem has become a matter of great debate over the past couple of years in the country and people are debating whether one should stand for it or not. In my film, I am ready to show Alauddin Khilji standing for the entire 52 seconds for the National Anthem when he hears it. Hopefully protesters will relent then and let me screen the film peacefully.”When asked how will he integrate National Anthem in a film based in early 14th Century, he said ,”Yaar documentary thodi banayi hai, creative freedom hai. You leave that part to me, I will find a way to insert the National Anthem. I will even show Shahid Kapoor’s army marching to AR Rahman’s Vande Mataram. Aur Bolo.”Karni Sena hasn’t yet responded to this offer by Mr. Bhansali but a counter protest against Mr. Bhansali is being organized this evening in JNU for forcing Khilji to stand up for the National Anthem.',fake
'BANGALORE (THE REAL FAKE NEWS)- Saying “I never noticed how much time there was”, 2nd year law student Avanti Sharma today finished all the readings that would be covered in the current trimester and next for all her 8 courses.“WhatsApp was down, so I tried uninstalling it and re-installing it for about ten minutes. Then I just gave up and looked around, and realised I had all this material available at the library and online sources, and I started browsing some of it and it was pretty interesting” she said.Soon, she had finished all her assigned readings and the books in the library, and had moved on the archives of law journals in the database. Without the constant buzzing and ticking sound, and the worry over whether a message was sent or not, she said she could “just relax and kind of focus much better.” By the end of half an hour, she had a whole new outlook to life and was planning her trip to International Court of Justice, where she had been asked to become a permanent judge.Catching up with her a few hours later, we asked her to teach us something of what she had learned. Her head bowed and her eyes on the phone, she mumbled, “something about property….there’s equity in there…crime was a big theme” before wandering off, narrowly avoiding a pillar, 2 dogs and 3 cheese maggis.',fake
'Mumbai: It has been more than hundred days since Arnab Goswami has left TimesNow. There are so many people in the street who are still missing the man and his high decibel action every day.A recent study shows of all the people it is the farmers who have suffered the most after Arnab stopped anchoring noisehour. The farmers were using the noise from Arnab’s show efficiently to stop wild animals straying into their fields during night time. “These new anchors are really disappointing, they cannot create any buzz,” said Nagaraj, a farmer who is struggling to protect his crops in post-Arnab era.Nagaraj shared his experience how he came to know ‘usefulness’ of noisehour for the first time. He said, “Sir, being a farmer I had to work hard throughout the day to make ends meet. On top of it I have to be alert through the night so that these wild animals do not destroy my hard earned crop. To keep ourselves awake, me and my friends will play cards at night, after some time got bored, so we pooled some money and bought a second hand TV with cable connection.” Nagaraj added, “TV became a nuisance & counterproductive for us. We would be busy watching latest latka jhatka of Bollywood songs, in the meantime these animals would have happily destroyed our fields in minutes. Accidentally one day while surfing, we stopped by a channel where we saw some fifteen to twenty people creating lot of noise. All were nicely dressed, especially the man in the center with a black coat whom all will be calling Arnab, Arnab and he would be stopping them, shouting at them. We noticed when the show is running, not a single animal came near our fields, they will run away as soon as they hear the noise.”“Now in last three months our life is back to square one. After beating drums through the night to scare the wild animals, we will have no energy to work next day,” said Nagaraj with a sad tone.To make Nagaraj happy, we told Arnab has already started his ‘riyaz’ and soon you will see him in a new channel called Republic.

'Kolkata: Overjoyed at ‘human-status’ given to non-living Ganga river, that makes it on a par with humans, and enforces severe punishment for any harm to her such as pollution, women rights groups today demanded similar human status be given to them, for attaining respect in the society they deserve. This has beffled environmentalists in the country who thought only non-living beings are subjected to abuse in the country so far.“Ganga was already a revered river in Hindu society, and was supposed to be treated on a par with God, but that’s not what has been happening. The same worshippers have polluted her to a level that makes her as bad as, if not worse, than the sewage water. Thousands of crores are spent every year to clean it, but she is getting dirtier every passing day. Probably declaring her as ‘human’ was the last desperate resort left to try,” said a high-ranking official of Ganga Action Plan to Teekhi Mirchi.“In a way, I find Indian women very similar to Ganga, considered sacred like Durga, Savitri, Gargi etc in religious texts, but treated like shit in our society. They have allocated even a Ministry for our so-called welfare, a designated women’s day for us, to satisfy their hypocrisy, but look at our ordeal,” said a protesting woman, adding that, “If we’re officially declared human, probably people will be reminded- we too deserve respect and dignity.”',fake

We ladies are much less prolific.Loss of human life during war is one of the factors that kept human life on planet earth in check for many centuries.

We just happened to see The Newshour for the first time yesterday and we were all shell-shocked. What the hell was that?! We’ve faced artillery fire, shelling and what not, but we’ve never, ever, ever, ever seen something like this until now. After seeing the episode, I wasn’t alone. All my 19 companions felt equally compelled to request Home Minister Rajnathji for security for our own selves, from incurring the wrath of Arnabji,” NSG commando Major Vijai Shukla told The UnReal Times, “if this request isn’t heeded to soon, we’ll have no other option but to tweet to Sushma Swaraj.”While the Home Ministry is yet to respond to their request, rival parties like the Aam Aadmi Party have rushed to their support. “The AAP is holely with the securitey forces on this.

You have got me all wrong. WHO THE HELL TOLD YOU THAT I WILL RAISE MY VOICE ON YOU?!” the anchor thundered.No sooner had Major Shukla attempted a reply, than Arnab shot back, “DO NOT INTERRUPT ME, MR. SECURITY!

'Tammy Bruce noticed something about the debate that was missed by most, the fact that Hillary Clinton gave Donald Trump something that cannot be theorized or merely talked about. It’s something that has to be demonstrated and he came through with flying colors. Mr. Trump showed how well he handles pressure.The stakes couldn’t have been higher from a political point of view but the newcomer to the political environment handled the situation like a seasoned professional. That cannot be communicated to the voters through any method other than seeing it firsthand. And all of those who tuned in on Sunday night saw exactly that.She said of Trump, “People saw Armageddon for the last 48 hours and they were wondering would he at least survive. He not only survived, he prevailed. This is a test of leadership. This is what the Clinton campaign gave him, effectively, was showing the American people that he can be under massive attack from all sides, be able to deal with it, adapt, change and then be steady, be focused on the issues.”Bruce said, “And that’s a test of leadership that you can’t speak about or tell people about. You have to show it and he showed it last night. That’s the theme that resonates with everyone. Women, independents, undecideds. It’s leadership at a time of crisis.”Varney raises Tammy Bruce’s history as the president of the NOW chapter in Los Angeles, asking, “How did you respond to Trump’s video tape?” She replied, “Look, clearly it’s awful.

' Here is the letter in it’s entirety:Below is a picture that I have only shared with our close friends and family. It’s highly personal to Joe and I and not something I take lightly. It’s one of the only images of our sweet girl that I will have until we reach heaven. This is why I share it with you now…I wasn’t going to add to all the chatter littering my news feed about this presidential election. But after Wednesday night’s debate and moving through these last few days, desperately missing my babies that were lost either by miscarriage or stillbirth, NOT by my choosing…I can’t help but pen these words. Please hear me friends…both candidates are liars. Both are “nasty” in their own way. Neither one lines up completely with my Christian values. Neither one hits all the issues the way I would like. I have truly *struggled* the last few months on who I was going to vote for, IF I was going to vote. With each new story that would break, each new accusation or headline, each new scandal that would surface…all of it left me disgusted and hopeless. Could this really be all we’ve got?!But then, something happened within the first few minutes of Wednesday night’s debate, and I haven’t been able to shake it. For the first time in over a year, I watched and heard Donald Trump be sympathetic, dare I say, convicted even, of what he was saying. When he said (concerning abortion), “that’s not okay with me” and “that’s not acceptable”, and that he would appoint Pro-Life, Supreme Court Justices…that was it. As a Christian, my choice was clear. While all of these other issues do indeed matter…nothing matters nearly as much as protecting the sanctity of human life. Not job security, not tax cuts, not education or health care, not border control or immigration laws, not inappropriate comments or deleted emails. All of it PALES in comparison to the taking of innocent, human life. I realized in that moment how selfish I had been by being SO concerned with all of the other issues. Friends, if we’re not protecting the sanctity of human life, we have NOTHING LEFT. And just so we’re clear, yes, I have been sexually assaulted by a man, and yes, I have been on the receiving end of inappropriate comments, almost my entire life. And still, my position remains the same…everything else pales in comparison to the taking of innocent, human life. As a Christian, I don’t see where there is any other choice. So, I will indeed be casting my vote on November 8th. And I will be voting for Donald Trump…if for no other reason than to protect the sanctity of human life. As a woman, as a mother, as a Christian, this is where I unapologetically stand.After 5 months of pregnancy, we lost Gabrielle without warning. I share this image with you because it could just as easily be the image of SO many other babies that Hillary Clinton thinks it’s okay to rip apart, piece by precious piece. Gabrielle was small, but even at 20 weeks, she had all ten fingers, all ten toes, she had a beautiful face with a nose, lips, eyes, and ears…she even had a cute little bum. She was loved and she was wanted. Unfortunately, she couldn’t be saved. But thousands more, just like her, can be…just not under a Clinton presidency. Hillary Clinton would probably call this post “scare rhetoric”…so be it. The idea of dismembering a human child SHOULD be scary. It should terrify us all that this kind of barbaric act is protected, even encouraged and applauded, by our United States government. It should be terrifying enough to vote Pro-Life, no matter where you stand on any other issue.Psalm 139:15-16, “My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in the secret place, when I was woven together in the depths of the earth. Your eyes saw my unformed body; all the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be”.',fake
'Okay, maybe not your refrigerator, but according to the people who are gradually figuring out just what hit Dyn, one of the backbone domain name system corporations in the United States, what happened involved millions of devices sending requests to the same place at the same time.The current assault against Dyn is one of the simplest in a hacker’s playbook. The distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) doesn’t require breaking into a target’s computers or finding any secret weakness. Instead, it involves simply pummeling them with so much traffic they can’t possibly keep up. Hackers executing a DDoS call upon millions of machines under their control and command them to ask the target for so many things all at once that the target all but melts down under the strain.Those millions of machines in this case, the smart devices in the “Internet of Things” that are connected to the larger whole, are known as “zombies.”  They aren’t actual computers like we think of them, but involve computerized parts and coding.  Items like smart refrigerators, stoves, dishwashers, DVRs, and on and on.  In this specific attack, the people doing the digging to figure out what happened claim that the zombies involved are infected with a piece of malware – malicious software – that doesn’t interfere with the running of the device, but will start sending connection requests upon command.That, the people of the geek-o-sphere tell us, is what happened.We’re told gadgets behind tens of millions of IP addresses were press-ganged into shattering the internet – a lot of them running the Mirai malware, the source code to which is now public so anyone can wield it against targets.The specific Mirai malware tool – THAT ANY HACKER CAN USE SINCE THE CODE IS PUBLIC – is called a botnet.  And that specific botnet works with electronics weaknesses that are found EVERYWHERE.Mirai powered the largest ever DDoS attack ever, spawning a 620Gbps DDoS against KrebsOnSecurity. Source code for the malware was released on hacker forums last week.The malware relied on factory default or hard-coded usernames and passwords to compromise vulnerable IoT devices such as insecure routers, IP cameras, digital video recorders and the like.PenTestPartners, the UK security consultancy behind numerous hack on Iot devices ranging from Wi-Fi enabled kettles to cars, said that the botnet finally illustrates the consequences of IoT vendors cutting the corners on security.“We’ve said many times previously that IoT would make for the perfect botnet: Easy to compromise, hard to patch and the owner likely won’t ever have a clue that they’re part of the botnet,” PenTestPartners notes.Essentially, the smart world that we live in was used against the Internet upon which we have all come to depend.  And the malware was sent out into the wild to prey on the smart devices that still have factory original passwords.  Popular Mechanics has a great explanation.Designed to target the Internet of Things specifically, Mirai can scoop up connected devices and add them to a botnet simply by attempting to log into them with their factory-default username and password…The Mirai code focuses on all kinds of smart devices including cameras to internet-connected fridges, but its bread and butter is DVRs. Of the nearly 500,000 devices known to be compromised by the Mirai malware, some 80 percent of them are DVRs, according to an in-depth investigation of by Level 3 communications.So, to help keep internet attacks like the one on Friday, October 21, 2016, to a minimum, ALWAYS change factory passwords on smart devices.As of this writing, whoever gave the order to send massive amount of information at Dyn is not known.  However, probing for weaknesses in the security measures that American internet backbone companies are using has been observed for months.  Somebody out there is trying to gauge what it will take to cause massive disruptions.  Friday may have been a test run to find out how fast Dyn could identify the problem and recover.  Three separate, and distinct attacks happened during the day, and by the third, they were watching for it.This sort of interruption in internet availability is sure to continue until the public is educated to change the passwords on smart devices.  This may not be a government induced test or hack at all.  That doesn’t mean it’s going to stop.For a great compilation of info, go to The Register out of the U.K.',fake

'DANA POINT, Calif. -- Outside of Hennessey\'s Tavern in Dana Point, a city south of Los Angeles, locals were surprised to hear about a Cinco de Mayo promotion-turned-controversy.On Friday, the bar put up an inflatable climbing wall, and those who scaled it received a \"green card\" for a free drink, CBS Los Angeles reports.On social media, the backlash was scathing. Comments blasted the promotion as insensitive, racist and catering to stereotypes.Comments also demanded that patrons boycott the bar.The tavern\'s owner, Paul Hennessey, responded on Facebook, saying it was a misunderstanding.\"Our intentions were to create a dialogue and show how ridiculous that it is to spend tens of millions of dollars to build a wall and even infer that Mexico foot some or the entire bill and have their citizens build it,\" the post said.\"This event obviously struck a chord with many of you out there and you and a number of you did not understand our intent,\" it said. \"I encourage all of you to take the time that you have spent posting on social media to spend an equal or greater amount of time writing your congressman or the president himself to express your concerns just as I have.\"One customer said that it sounded like a good idea to bring some extra money in for the bar but \"was in poor taste.\"One employee who asked not to be identified questioned the statement, saying that the bar handed out mustaches and some customers chanted \"build the wall.\"The promotion does have some defenders.

'Historically, a tolerant India witnessed seamless confluence of ideas, values, cultures and religions. Today, the intelligentsia believes that growing intolerance has impeded civilisational growth by endangering free speech. Repeated featuring of films in Supreme Court judgments would tell us a very different story — a story of continuous intolerance towards films. From government to fringe elements, we have never been tolerant or respected right to free speech when it came to films portraying the personal lives of famous and notorious personalities. Rewind to the 1960s. K A Abbas had moved the SC to challenge the Centre\'s demand for cuts in his film \'A Tale of Four Cities\' highlighting the chasm in the lives of the rich and the poor in four metropolises, which included the life of those operating in red light areas, for a \'U\' certificate. The SC\'s judgment [1970 (2) SCC 780] reflects the 1960s mindset. It upheld censorship and said, \"Motion pictures must be regarded differently from other forms of speech and expression. A person reading a book or other writing or hearing a speech or viewing a painting or sculpture is not as deeply stirred as by seeing a motion picture. Therefore, treatment of the latter on a different footing is also a valid classification.\" In 1975, Amrit Nahata\'s film \'Kissa Kursi Ka\' boldly portrayed the political doings of Indira Gandhi and her petulant political heir, Sanjay Gandhi. CBFC refused certification. Nahata moved the SC. The SC judges wanted to see the film before deciding the petition. What Karni Sena is threatening to do with \'Padmavati\' now was done by Sanjay Gandhi and then I&B minister VC Shukla in 1975. All prints of the film were brought to Delhi from Bombay, taken to the Maruti factory in Gurgaon and burnt. The SC was told the film prints were misplaced and could not be shown to the judges. This brazenness shocked the SC but it could send Sanjay Gandhi to jail for a month only after Indira Gandhi was defeated in the elections. The famous Raj Kapoor too was not spared. He faced prosecution for \'Satyam Shivam Sundaram\' along with the producer, actors and others connected to the movie as a complaint accused them of projecting sexuality, moral depravity and eroding public decency. The SC quashed the prosecution [1980 (1) SCC 43] and gave a thumbs up to artistic freedom of expression. Tamil film \'Ore Oru Gramathile\' became the centre of controversy for showcasing politicisation of reservation for backward classes and the flip side of it — upper caste youth obtaining false caste certificates to get employment. It was denied certification by the CBFC. Dealing with this film, the SC in S Rangarajan vs P Jagjivan Ram [1989(2) SCC 574] appeared to have come of age and ruled, \"The standard to be applied by the (censor) board or courts for judging a film should be that of an ordinary man of common sense and prudence and not that of an out of the ordinary or hypersensitive man. \"We, however, wish to add a word more. The censor board should exercise considerable circumspection on movies affecting the morality or decency of our people and cultural heritage of the country. Moral values in particular, should not be allowed to be sacrificed in the guise of social change or cultural assimilation... We do not, however, mean that the censors should have an orthodox or conservative outlook. Far from it, they must be responsive to social change and they must go with the current climate. All we wish to state is that the censors may display more sensitivity to movies which will have a markedly deleterious effect to lower the moral standards of those who see it.\" In between, there were numerous films, including \'Bandit Queen\', \'Kuttrapathirikai\' (on Rajiv Gandhi assassination), \'Santhana Kadu\' (on Veerappan), \'BlackFriday\' and \'Udta Punjab\', which faced their share of controversy, some engineered and some spontaneous. Many films were based on lifestoriesof famous and notorious personalities. For such autobiographical films, the SC and HCs had put a caveat — they can be based on information available in public records and field information but cannot depict private lives as it would violate right to privacy of those personalities or their relatives. Buton November 16, the SC while refusing to interfere with the release of \'An Insignificant Man\', based on Arvind Kejriwal\'s life, struck a nail on the head of intolerance towards artistic freedom of expression. \"An artist has his own freedom to express himself in a manner which is not prohibited in law and such prohibitions are not read by implication to crucify the rights of expressive mind. Human history records that there are many authors who express their thoughts according to the choice of their words, phrases, expressions and also create characters who may look absolutely different than an ordinary man would conceive of. A thought provoking film should never mean that it has to be didactic or in any way puritanical. It can be expressive and provoking the conscious or the sub-conscious thoughts of the viewer. If there has to be any limitation, that has to be as per the prescription in law,\" CJI Dipak Misra said while dictating the order in open court. The three-judge bench said, \"The courts are to be extremely slow to pass any kind of restraint order in such a situation and should allow the respect that a creative man enjoys in writing a drama, a play, a play let, a book on philosophy, or any kind of thought that is expressed on celluloid or theatre etc.\" Get latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.',real
'Would you prefer a heavily built man with strong muscles, financially strong men or someone who can be easily compatible with you? Your choice of partners decides whether you are a modern day feminist or someone who continue to follow the traditional values of masculinity.A new research claims that the image of a white, wealthy and muscular male still retains as an object of desire among many women.The study, published in the journal Feminist Media Studies, derived that people still desire the traditional masculine values of muscles and money in the men they find attractive and have not moved on from long-established gender roles.“They are marking the middle-class, wealthy, mobile and sexually powerful male body, not as a political one as feminists intend it to be, but one that should be actively desired. This celebration of masculine capital is achieved through humour and the knowing wink, but the outcome is a reaffirmation of men’s position in society,” said Adrienne Evans, researcher at the Coventry University in England.“It’s a problem as because although it appears as though we have moved forward, our desires are still mostly about money and strength,” Evans added.The researchers used the responses provided by the onlookers over various images of men posted on TubeCrush website, where commuters upload photographs, taken covertly, of attractive men, over a period of three years.The photographs emphasised on men’s muscular biceps, pecs and chest; the body parts which suggest physical strength and sexual prowess, along with many symbols of disposable income and wealth, such as smart suits, watches and phones.',real
'YOKOTA AIR BASE: President Donald Trump today warned that \"no dictator\" should underestimate the United States, in a thinly veiled reference to North Korea, which is likely to dominate his Asian tour. Speaking to cheering servicemen at Yokota Air Base just west of Tokyo, Trump donned a military jacket offered to him and issued a threat that \"no one, no dictator, no regime and no nation should underestimate... American resolve\". \"Every once in a while in the past, they underestimated us. It was not pleasant for them, was it?\" roared Trump. \"We will never yield, never waver and never falter in defence of our people, our freedom and our great American flag.\" Trump\'s marathon trip comes with the North Korea crisis at fever pitch, with US bombers running sorties over the Korean peninsula and fears mounting of another Pyongyang missile test. The president\'s first stops are Japan and South Korea -- frontline US allies in the effort to force Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear programme, and the two countries with most to fear should a full-scale conflict break out. Trump touched down under clear blue Tokyo skies and stepped out with his wife Melania in bright sunshine to greet the crowds. Speaking to reporters on the plane, he announced he would likely be meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin during the tour, as the international community battles for a solution to the North Korean missile crisis. \"I think it\'s expected we\'ll meet with Putin, yeah. We want Putin\'s help on North Korea, and we\'ll be meeting with a lot of different leaders,\" said Trump. He added that North Korea was a \"big problem for our country and for the world, and we want to get it solved\" but had kind words for the people in the hermit state. \"I think they\'re great people. They\'re industrious. They\'re warm, much warmer than the world really knows or understands. They\'re great people. And I hope it all works out for everybody,\" he said. The next stop for Trump is a golfing date with his \"friend\" Shinzo Abe, prime minister of Japan, which has seen missiles fired over its northern island amid threats by Pyongyang to \"sink\" it into the sea. Trump and Abe enjoy a close personal relationship and the three-day Japan leg of the trip is noticeably relaxed, with the two leaders being serenaded by wacky internet sensation Pikotaro after their nine holes. The Japanese leader has emerged strengthened from a crushing victory in a snap election and has firmly supported Trump in his policy of exerting maximum pressure on Kim, backed up with the threat of military force. \"I want to further cement the bond of the Japan-US alliance, based on our relations of trust and friendship with President Trump,\" said Abe as Trump arrived. Trump for his part described Japan as a \"treasured partner and crucial ally of the US\". \"Trump only has to play golf in Japan, as he knows Japan will follow (the US) whatever happens. Everything has been sorted out beforehand,\" Tetsuro Kato, political scientist at Tokyo\'s Hitotsubashi University, told AFP. While Trump has been in regular contact with the hawkish Abe during the North Korean missile crisis, he pointedly failed to speak to South Korean President Moon Jae-in for several days after Pyongyang\'s second intercontinental ballistic missile test in July. Analysts point to Abe and Moon\'s contrasting approaches to the crisis as an underlying factor, although both leaders will be hoping to press Trump into reaffirming Washington\'s steadfast commitment to their defence. Trump labelled Moon\'s approach as \"appeasement\" on Twitter, a comment that did not go down well in the Blue House. \"The two sides have subtle differences in their positions,\" said Kim Hyun-Wook, a professor at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy. Trump will not follow the well- trodden path to the De-Militarized Zone dividing the Korean peninsula -- a visit derided in Washington as a bit of a \"cliche.\" From Seoul, Trump travels to China to meet his counterpart Xi Jinping who, like Abe, has solidified his grip on power, after being handed a second term.

The US administration has made demands that the other members say are unacceptable, such as a five-year “sunset” clause and tightening so-called rules of origin to boost the North American content of autos.“It is very slow moving but there are no fireworks,” said a Canadian source with knowledge of the talks, adding there had “not been much conversation at all” on the more contentious US proposals.Within hours of the latest round of talks formally starting on Friday, Canada was complaining about inflexibility by the United States.Officials have so far discussed other issues such as labor, gender, intellectual property, energy and telecommunications but it is too soon to say whether there will be any breakthroughs this round, added a source familiar with the talks.“The work is moving forward,” Mexican deputy economy minister Juan Carlos Baker told reporters, adding that the three countries had prioritized technical work in Mexico City. But he said negotiators were aware that much work lay ahead and “we have to double our efforts.”“The atmosphere is good, the atmosphere is one of work,” Baker added.The mood was calmer than the tense scenes during last month’s round in Arlington, Virginia, where tough U.S. demands were revealed. Still, the negotiations have passed the halfway point of an initial schedule with few clear signs of process.Mexican officials hope chapters on telecommunications and e-commerce will be concluded by the end of business on Tuesday, but there has been no indication of this yet.Although negotiators are scheduled to discuss rules of origin every day, the source said detailed talks on boosting North American content would not be held before the end of the round on Tuesday.Canada and Mexico say the new rules of origin are unworkable and would damage the highly-integrated auto industry.“I hope the United States understands there are things … that Mexico won’t accept, and (I hope) the negotiating process becomes more rational,” Moises Kalach, head of the international negotiating arm of Mexico’s CCE business lobby, told Reuters.On Friday, the US Trade Representative’s office revised its official objectives to conform to its current demands.The move prompted US Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, to remove a “hold” he had put in place to block confirmation of two Trump administration nominees for deputy USTR positions, a Wyden aide said.Wyden had complained the trade office was keeping members of Congress “in the dark”.',real

'NEW DELHI: Almost one in every three toilets built in rural areas are unsafe on health and sanitation parameters, a sample survey on the technologies under the Swachh Bharat Mission has shown. It has also found that nearly 60\% of these toilets are twin-leach pits, which the government has been promoting under Swachh Bharat Mission considering that these are safer. The survey by WaterAid, an international non-profit- published last month-covered 1,024 built and under-construction toilets. The report titled \'Quality and Sustainability of Toilets\' also says that about 36\% of the built toilets it surveyed will need upgradation in the next couple of years either because they were single-leach pit toilets or because they were twin pit toilets without the minimum distance required between pits. The rapid assessment of toilets was carried out across 16 districts in eight states in March. The survey results have been uploaded online. Though this is a small sample, it suggests reasons why there is a greater need to build safer and sustainable toilets. \"Almost a third (31\%) of the 776 constructed toilets surveyed, despite being functional, were unsafe as they failed to guarantee the prevention of human contact with faecal matter. This includes toilets without a trap (the curved pipe that captures water to prevent contact with faeces) and those suspected of contaminating water sources,\" it said. The report added that doubts are primarily centred around leach pits, when located in water logged areas, as well as where vertical distance to water table or horizontal distance to drinking water points is not respected. \"Overall, over two-thirds (69\%) of the constructed toilets were deemed safe,\" it said. It added that 30\% of the toilets constructed were deemed user-friendly, which had a solid wall and a roof, a door with latch, ventilation, natural light and water. Less than a quarter of households reported that the initiative to build toilets was their own, instead it came from the panchayat representative .

'NEW DELHI: More than one out of every 10 deaths in road accidents across the world is reported from India and among all nations it has the highest share of road fatalities. According to estimates, more than 10 lakh people would have died globally by now this year and over a lakh in India. But road safety is not yet in government\'s focus and it struggles to pass the Motor Vehicle Amendments Bill even three years after it had announced to bring the updated law to improve road safety. The Bill was mooted soon after former Union Minister Gopinath Munde died in a road crash in Delhi. On Sunday, National Coalition of NGOs and road safety activists appealed to the law makers to pass the Bill in the next session of Parliament. Sunday was observed as the World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims across the globe. \"Road traffic injuries are the number 1 killer of young people. I am not talking about a mysterious bug that we do not know how to deal with. It\'s a perfectly solvable problem that we chose to ignore!\" tweeted Dr Etiene Krug, director of Department for Management of Non-communicable Diseases, Disability, Violence and Injury Prevention at World Health Organisation. According to the latest road accident report of 2016, over 4.8 lakh accidents took place on Indian roads, which claimed more than 1.5 lakh lives and left about 4.95 lakh people injured. Globally approximately 1.3 million traffic deaths happen worldwide and that 93\% of these occur in low and middle-income countries including India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. This is despite the fact that these countries only have 54\% of the world\'s registered vehicles. WHO report says only 47 countries, representing 13\% of the world population, have laws that meet best practice on urban speed, which is a critical risk factor to address road death and serious injury.

'Car bomb blast kills 6 near hotel in Somalia\'s capital\nABDI GULED, ASSOCIATED PRESS\nt\nhttp://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/car-bomb-blast-kills-hotel-somalias-capital-46088611\nA suicide car bomber detonated near a hotel in Somalia\'s capital Monday morning, killing at least six people and injuring four others, police said.\n\nThe bomber detonated near the Weheliye hotel on the busy Maka Almukarramah road, Capt. Mohamed Hussein said. Ambulances rushed to the scene.\n\nThe al-Qaida-linked Islamic extremist group al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the blast, according to the group\'s Andalus radio. The group has often targeted hotels in Mogadishu, including a hotel attack in late January that killed at least 26 people.\n\nIn a separate blast Monday morning, a suicide bomber detonated a minibus laden with explosives at the gate of a military camp south of the capital. The bomber was killed and two people were wounded, said Col. Yusuf Burhan, a Somali military officer.\n\nSomalia\'s new Prime Minister Hassan Ali Khaire condemned the two attacks, saying they were carried out by \"bloodthirsty groups.\"\n\nDespite being ousted from most of its key strongholds in south and central Somalia, al-Shabab continues to carry out deadly guerrilla attacks across the country. In the past couple of years it has started to target checkpoints and bases of both the Somali military and the multinational African Union force.\n\nAl-Shabab poses a major challenge to Somalia\'s new President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, who has vowed to make security a priority in this Horn of Africa country as the fragile central government seeks to expand its control outside key areas like the capital.',real
'A 101-year-old man who told his wife to flee deadly wildfires in Northern California without him last month is the latest victim to be identified by authorities. The Press Democrat newspaper of Santa Rosa reported that coroner’s officials on Thursday identified the man as longtime Santa Rosa resident Tak-Fu Hung. He was one of at least 43 people killed by the fires that raged across a huge swath of wine country.Hung’s granddaughter told the newspaper that her grandfather, who had fought the Communists in China’s 1949 revolution, got as far as the front door of his burning home when he told his 76-year-old wife, Helen, he could not make it through the flames. “He told her, ‘Just go,\'” Rosanne O’Hara said by phone from San Francisco. “He would not make it. He couldn’t make it.”Helen Hung sought shelter behind a wall in the family’s front yard and later by lying on a neighbor’s driveway for hours as the flames passed over her, O’Hara said. She suffered multiple burns but is recovering. “The flames went over her repeatedly, but she was far away from brush, so that the fire wasn’t constantly on her,” O’Hara said.Hung was the second centenarian identified as a victim of the fast-moving fires. Charles Rippey, a 100-year-old World War II veteran, also perished in his home. He was believed to be trying to help his 98-year-old wife, Sara, when the couple were overcome by smoke and flames. His wife also died.The couple, who had met in elementary school, had been married 75 years. Sonoma County has identified 21 of the 23 people who died in the fires there, said Misti Harris, a spokeswoman for the sheriff’s office. They are using DNA information to identify the remaining bodies.She said all missing person reports, which peaked at over 2,000, have been resolved in the county. The city of Santa Rosa did not have an immediate answer to the number of missing person reports still pending. O’Hara described her grandfather as a friendly, outgoing man who enjoyed conversation and was remarkably healthy for his age, only recently having begun to use a cane. Often the center of attention, she said, he was “really good at commanding a room.”Born in China’s Anhui province in 1915, Hung was a general in the Chinese army before he fled to Hong Kong and later Taiwan after Mao Zedong’s Communist Party came to power following the country’s 1949 revolution.He worked as a civil engineer in Taiwan, where he and his first wife raised six children before her death. After he retired, he moved to San Francisco and later Santa Rosa. His children and grandchildren followed him to the United States, O’Hara said, and his tri-level Santa Rosa home became the gathering place for holidays and other celebrations.',real
'FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- Meat falling from the sky is weird, even by Florida standards.But that\'s what happened at 4 a.m. Saturday when a 15-pound bag of frozen pork landed on the Deerfield Beach home of Travis Adair and his family.Adair said Thursday that the package hit his roof with a \"big bang.\" He thought it was thunder, but his wife Jennie later went outside and found two bundles next to the house. His son Austin found three on the roof.\"It had to fall from the sky,\" Adair said. \"It was too heavy to throw on the roof.\" The home is near three airports, so Adair thinks it fell from a plane.The Federal Aviation Administration had no immediate comment Thursday.Labeling on the package shows it originally belonged to Jim Williams, who lives 170 miles away in Myakka City, a rural town of 6,300 residents. Williams, who owns a company that prepares fields for planting, said Thursday he bought some pigs from some children at a county fair in January. He kept much of the meat and gave some away but he has no idea how any of it ended up on the Adairs\' roof. He is not a pilot and doesn\'t own a plane.\"I would have thought 15 pounds of frozen meat falling from an airplane would have put a hole in the roof,\" Williams said.His friend, Jimmy Fussell, who owns the butcher shop that processed the pigs for Williams, said the mystery, which was featured on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!,\" certainly \"beats hearing about all the politics going on.\" And it has given everyone in Myakka City a laugh.As for the meat, the Adairs threw it away -- though Williams has offered to throw the family a barbecue.',real

'Officials warn of global religious extremism threat to China\nGERRY SHIH, ASSOCIATED PRESS\nt\nhttp://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/officials-warn-global-religious-extremism-threat-china-46087679\nChinese officials are issuing new warnings about the specter of global religious extremism seeping into the country, following reports of fighters from China\'s Muslim minority fighting alongside militants in Syria and Iraq.\n\nSharhat Ahan, a top political and legal affairs party official in Xinjiang, on Sunday became the latest official from a predominantly Muslim region to warn about China becoming destabilized by the \"international anti-terror situation\" and calling for a \"people\'s war.\"\n\nOver the past year, regional leaders in Xinjiang, home to the Uighur (pronounced WEE-gur) ethnic minority, have ramped up surveillance measures and police patrols and staged massive rallies intended to showcase the power of the security forces.\n\nThose demonstrations are intended to \"declare war against terrorists, to showcase the party and the government\'s resolve to fight terror, resolve to preserve public safety and (China\'s) mighty combat strength,\" Ahan told officials gathered in Beijing for this month\'s National People\'s Congress.\n\nAlthough some scholars question whether global jihadi networks are active in the country, top Chinese officials are increasingly echoing strands of international discourse to back up claims that Islamic extremism is growing worldwide and needs to be rolled back.\n\nIn recent years, hundreds have died in violent incidents mainly in Xinjiang that officials blame on Uighur separatists inspired by the global Jihadi cause.\n\nWhile it has provided little evidence, the government, says Xinjiang faces a grave separatist threat from Uighur fighters linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group. IS released a video in late February purportedly showing Uighur fighters training in Iraq and vowing to strike China, according to the SITE Intelligence Group.\n\nOfficials from Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region â€” which has an ethnic Hui population that is predominantly Muslim but, unlike Xinjiang, rarely sees separatist or religious violence â€” warned similarly this past week about the perils of Islamic extremism. Speaking at a regional meeting open to the media, Ningxia Communist Party secretary Li Jianhua drew comparisons to the policies of President Donald Trump\'s administration to make his point.\n\n\"What the Islamic State and extremists push is jihad, terror, violence,\" Li said. \"This is why we see Trump targeting Muslims in a travel ban. It doesn\'t matter whether anti-Muslim policy is in the interests of the U.S. or it promotes stability, it\'s about preventing religious extremism from seeping into all of American culture.\"\n\nWu Shimin, a former ethnic affairs official from Ningxia, said that ideological work must be strengthened in the region to promote a Chinese identity among its Hui population, the descendants of Muslim traders plying the Silk Road centuries ago.\n\n\"The roots of the Hui are in China,\" Wu said. \"To discuss religious consciousness, we must first discuss Chinese consciousness. To discuss the feelings of minorities, we must first discuss the feelings of the Chinese people.\"\n\nThe officially atheistic Communist Party has long viewed religion with suspicion but has generally granted a fair degree of religious freedom to its Hui minority, especially in their heartland of Ningxia, where mosques dot the skyline. The party has kept a far tighter grip over Xinjiang\'s Uighurs â€” who have a language, culture and physical features that are more closely linked to Central Asia â€” partly due to the existence of a decades-old separatist movement.\n\nBut the comments by party officials in Ningxia, seen as traditionally more lax on ethnic and religious policy, reflected the top Chinese leadership\'s growing anxieties about Islam more broadly over the past year, analysts said.\n\n\"There\'s a strengthening trend of viewing Islam as a problem in Chinese society,\" said Mohammed al-Sudairi, a doctoral student at the University of Hong Kong. \"Xi Jinping has been quite anxious about what he saw as the loss of party-state control over the religious sphere when he entered power, which necessitated this intervention. I don\'t think things will take a softer turn.\"',real
'CHICAGO -- It seems correctional officers at the Chicago jail feel strongly about spending time with their moms.The Cook County Sheriff\'s Department says more than 200 officers at the county jail called in sick or invoked the Family Medical Leave Act -- the federal law that requires employers provide leave for some medical reasons -- to explain their absence on Sunday, Mother\'s Day.The department says another 154 informed the jail they won\'t be coming to work for the shift that starts later in the day.\"The extraordinary number of call offs puts additional pressure on the men and women of the Sheriff\'s office who come to work as scheduled,\" the department said in a statement to the Chicago Sun-Times.Jail officials speculated that the nice weather and the fact that it\'s Mother\'s Day might explain the light attendance.

'Last Updated Jun 29, 2017 6:54 PM EDTNEW YORK -- Some unwelcome visitors have appeared at the Crossroads of the World.Just when you thought you\'d seen it all in Times Square, 30,000 honeybees decided to swarm a ledge 17 stories up, CBS New York reports.\"If you just look to the right, you could just go straight down Broadway and there was just the heart of Times Square right there,\" Hannah Baek of AndrewsHoney.com told CBS New York.The swarm took over the entire ledge Tuesday in Times Square. Andrew Coté of AndrewsHoney.com -- a fourth-generation beekeeper -- found himself perched on the ledge with a hose.\"I had the harness very secure, and I used a low suction vacuum that is used specifically to pick up honeybees,\" Coté said.But the bees -- at least one -- did not go without a fight.\"I only got stung once, and I was only stung because I had lent my gloves to my young assistant,\" Coté said.That young assistant was Augustine Lodise, 15, who on Wednesday was dressed in a bee costume to help sell honey.\"People on the other side of the street and the buildings were also looking at us, and it was just awe inspiring,\" Lodise said.Believe it or not, this was not the highest Coté has gone to get to a swarm. Nineteen stories is a record.The Times Square swarm took about 30 minutes to remove. Once the bees were secured, they were moved to a dwindling hive that Coté oversees at Bryant Park.This also was not the first time such a swam of bees has been seen in New York City. In fact, it was the third time this month.Bees covered a van in Midtown on June 2, and two weeks ago, they swarmed a downtown building. Coté said it is to be expected because it is swarm season.\"Fewer than usual, but we\'ve still had many,\" he said.But where did the bees at the Crossroads of the World come from? Coté said they came from a hotel rooftop hive across the street.\"So this queen left the hotel; she checked out,\" Coté said. \"She took about a third of the bees with her -- maybe half -- and she was looking for better accommodations.\"That was bee humor. But why did they really leave?\"They\'re either overpopulated in the hive they\'re in, or they don\'t have good ventilation,\" Coté said. But in any case, the queen leaves and she takes a third to a half with her so they can start a new colony. It\'s how one colony becomes two it\'s how they propagate their species.\"And while the swarm looked threatening, Coté said the bees were not interested in humans -- only a place to stay.Coté said bee swarm season starts Memorial Day and ends on the Fourth of July. He also said swarms usually have been 15,000 and 20,000 bees, so this one was rather large.',real

'Malaysia says it will give Kim\'s family time to claim body\nEILEEN NG, ASSOCIATED PRESS\nt\nhttp://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/malaysia-give-kims-family-time-claim-body-46087418\nMalaysia\'s health minister said Monday that the government will give relatives of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\'s estranged half brother two to three weeks to claim his body before deciding what to do with it.\n\nMalaysian authorities say Kim Jong Nam died after two women smeared his face with the banned VX nerve agent at Kuala Lumpur\'s airport on Feb. 13, but North Korea â€” which is widely suspected to be behind the attack â€” rejects the findings.\n\nNorth Korea has demanded the body back from Day One and objected to Malaysia\'s autopsy. Pyongyang also has refused to acknowledge that Kim Jong Nam was the victim and has referred to him as Kim Chol, the name on the passport Kim was carrying when he was attacked in a crowded airport terminal.\n\nOn Friday, Malaysian police confirmed that Kim Chol and Kim Jong Nam was the same person, but refused to say how they identified Kim.\n\n\"Now with the positive identification of the body, we are told that he had a wife or wives and children,\" Health Minister Subramaniam Sathasivam told reporters on Monday. \"So we hope that those people will respond and come forward to claim the body. In the absence of that, then we will address it as a government ... in trying to find how we are going to take the next step.\"\n\n\"I think after identification, we\'ll give ourselves about two to three weeks to solve the problem,\" he said.\n\nThe body is being kept at a morgue at a Kuala Lumpur hospital.\n\nSince Kim\'s death, relations between the two countries have steadily deteriorated, with each expelling the other\'s ambassador. Last Tuesday, North Korea blocked all Malaysians from leaving the country until a \"fair settlement\" of the case was reached. Malaysia then barred North Koreans from exiting its soil.\n\nMalaysian Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said Monday that negotiations with North Korea were taking place, but he did not give details.\n\nThere are nine Malaysians in North Korea â€” three embassy staff members and their family members. Some 315 North Koreans are in Malaysia, according to Malaysian officials.\n\nBoth countries have also scrapped visa-free travel for each other\'s citizens.\n\nAlthough Malaysia has never directly accused North Korea of being behind the attack, many speculate that Pyongyang must have orchestrated it. Experts say the VX nerve agent used to kill Kim was almost certainly produced in a sophisticated state weapons laboratory, and North Korea is widely believed to possess large quantities of chemical weapons.\n\nFour of the seven North Korean suspects being sought by Malaysia are believed to have left the country the day Kim was killed. Police say the other three suspects, including a North Korean diplomat, are believed to be in hiding at the North Korean Embassy in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThe attack was caught on surveillance video that shows two women going up to Kim and apparently smearing something on his face. He was dead within 20 minutes, authorities say. Two women â€” one Indonesian, one Vietnamese â€” have been charged with murder but say they were duped into thinking they were playing a harmless prank.',real
'NEW DELHI: More than 50 lakh homes for the poor will be built in rural areas across the country by March 31 under a central scheme bringing social transformation in villages, the government said on Monday. Under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Gramin) a target to construct one crore new houses by March 31, 2019, was set. Of these, 51 lakh houses had to be completed by 31st March 2018, the rural development ministry said in an official statement. After the launch in 2016, it took a few months to complete the process of beneficiary registration, geo-tagging, account verification etc, the ministry said adding that it used Socio Economic Census of 2011 for selection of beneficiaries. The homeless and those living in one kuccha room with kuccha roof or two kuccha rooms with kuccha roof are the beneficiaries of this pro-poor PMAY scheme. The homes are designed by the best of institutions after studying the existing local design typologies and are constructed by beneficiaries as per their need. The payment for construction of the houses is directly transferred into the accounts of beneficiaries, the ministry said. \"The poor are getting safe homes and can live with dignity with facilities like toilet, LPG connection, electricity connection, drinking water facility etc,\" it said. To ensure transparency and check corruption, the Centre has set up an online platform where any person can see the construction of homes with geo-tagged photographs and complete details of beneficiaries and payments made to them. The ministry has also decided to commission a study on social transformation to understand the impact of the housing programme. Besides this, the National Institute of Public Finance & Policy will also study the governance reforms under PMAY(G) and the impact of higher demand for steel and cement on growth.

'CHICAGO -- Fifty teens on probation for a variety of offenses gathered at a prominent South Side mortuary for a funeral service, CBS Chicago reports.Not just anyone\'s funeral -- their own.There were flowers, a soloist, a closed (and empty) casket and a program that read on the front, \"The final effect of gun violence on youth -- Death. Your funeral services.\"Pastor Michael Hodges recalled the 1991 murder of his nephew Eric, who was mistaken by his killers for a rival gang member, and shot eight times.He then told the young men, \"We\'re here because we want to reach you.\"Probation Officer James Worthington is also a licensed mortician who brought the idea to Leak and Sons Funeral Home. Mortuary president Spencer Leak eagerly signed on and also spoke during the two-hour service.Worthington and Hodges have both participated in the funerals of young murder victims and each says he would be pleased never to have to do another.Some of the teens dressed neatly, while others wore ripped jeans. Some appeared to be paying attention, while others sat head in hands; it was difficult to determine if they were emotional or asleep.\"We desire that they live,\" Hodges said as the service concluded.Each received community service time. Before filing out, they were told that they will get more credit if they write their own obituary.',real
'ALBANY, N.Y. -- During nearly four decades of marriage, Akosua Budu Amoako and her husband tried to have a child, without success. But last month, at age 59, Budu gave birth to her first child after fertility treatments.The full-term 7-pound, 4-ounce boy was born June 15 at Bellevue Woman\'s Center in Niskayuna, near Albany. He\'s named after his father, Isaiah Somuah Anim.\"They\'re doing super, very well,\" Dr. Khushru Irani, who delivered the baby, told The Associated Press on Monday. The couple, he added, \"are so happy about the whole thing.\"Budu said she and her 59-year-old husband, who live in Schenectady, had tried for years to get pregnant naturally after they married 38 years ago, but they eventually stopped trying. Then last year, after learning that a 60-year-old woman in the couple\'s homeland of Ghana gave birth to triplets after fertility treatments, the couple, both medical professionals at a local hospital, decided to try once again to have a child.Irani said he was apprehensive at first, noting the risks of complications that can arise from giving birth at such an advanced age.\"Initially, when I saw her, I\'m saying no, it\'s not a good idea for your health to have a baby at your age,\" the doctor said. \"But they were very insistent and they wanted to try it out.\"Budu underwent in vitro fertilization at an Albany-area clinic using her husband\'s sperm and a donor egg. The entire process, from initial screening to successful fertilization, cost $20,000 and took about a year, the elder Amin told the newspaper.\"We haven\'t gotten much sleep, but I feel fine and I think he already knows our voices,\" Budu told The Albany Times Union.The couple, who came to the United States in 2005, are naturalized U.S. citizens.\"And our son is born an American, and a New Yorker,\" Amin said.',real
'NEW DELHI: Much before the government finalised the new \"strategic partnership\" policy six months ago to boost the Indian private sector\'s role in defence production, the country\'s first major military aircraft manufacturing project for domestic firms with foreign collaboration was initiated over six years ago. But the Rs 11,929 crore project for manufacturing 56 medium transport aircraft by the Tata-Airbus consortium to replace the IAF\'s aging Avro fleet is still nowhere close to being inked, defence ministry sources said on Monday. This despite the fact the Defence Acquisitions Council (DAC) in May 2015, headed by the then defence minister Manohar Parrikar, had approved the Tata-Airbus project in what was seen to be a bold move after the previous UPA regime had developed cold feet under strong pressure from the PSU lobby. This is yet another example of how the entire \'Make in India\' policy in defence production continues to flounder due to convoluted procedures, bureaucratic bottle-necks, turf wars and the lack of the requisite political decisiveness. At least six major Make in India projects collectively worth over Rs 3.5 lakh crore are stuck at different stages without the actual contracts being signed, as was reported by TOI last month. MoD sources on Monday said the \'Avro-replacement\' project is \"going around in circles\" at the commercial negotiations stage. \"The CNC (contract negotiation committee) began its work eight-nine months ago after extended field trials of the twin-turboprop tactical C-295 aircraft on offer by the Airbus. But nothing much has happened...there seems to be a reluctance to go forward,\" said a source. The IAF, on its part, continues to soldier on with the aging Avros, which were first inducted into the force half-a-century ago. The turbo-prop aircraft have recorded around 20 cases of \"engine failure in the air\" over the last two years. The Avro-replacement project, which sought to break the virtual monopoly of defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd in the field, was touted as just the right programme for the private sector to kick-start domestic production in the expanding aircraft market. The first 16 aircraft were to be bought from the foreign original equipment manufacturer under it, with the rest 40 being manufactured by the Indian Production Agency within eight years. Moreover, it was said, the aircraft would also be much in demand in the civil aviation and other sectors.

'WikiLeaks\' latest release raises questions about who and why\nDEB RIECHMANN, ASSOCIATED PRESS\nt\nhttp://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/wikileaks-latest-release-raises-questions-46088361\nIt\'s not just who did it, but why.\n\nWikiLeaks\' release of nearly 8,000 documents that purportedly reveal secrets about the CIA\'s tools for breaking into targeted computers, cellphones and even smart TVs has given rise to multiple theories about who stole the documents and for what reason.\n\nPerhaps it was a U.S. spy or contractor who felt jilted. Maybe the CIA was exposed by a foreign country that wanted to embarrass U.S. intelligence. Could it have been a CIA insider worried about Americans\' privacy rights?\n\nSome possible motives behind last week\'s disclosure:\n\nFROM THE SOURCE\n\nIn a statement released with the documents, the anti-secrecy group launched by Julian Assange in 2006 said the source told the organization that there are policy questions in urgent need of public debate Among them were \"whether the CIA\'s hacking capabilities exceed its mandated powers\" and the \"problem of public oversight of the agency.\"\n\nThe CIA, while not confirming that the documents are authentic, isn\'t necessarily buying that explanation.\n\n\"As we\'ve said previously, Julian Assange is not exactly a bastion of truth and integrity,\" CIA spokeswoman Heather Fritz Horniak said. She said the CIA\'s work would continue \"despite the efforts of Assange and his ilk.\"\n\nRobert Chesney, a national security law expert from the University of Texas School of Law, said WikiLeaks could have put the material online to damage the reputation of U.S. intelligence agencies.\n\n\"Julian Assange is in the business of trying to reduce American power. That\'s just fact,\" he said.\n\n\"It\'s about giving the CIA\'s reputation a black eye,\" he said. \"I think they are trying to induce panic and make people even more skeptical of the intelligence agencies.\"\n\nAssange said during an online news conference Thursday that it was \"not true\" that WikiLeaks was focused on the United States. He cited recent publications dealing with Germany and Turkey and numerous references to Russia and China throughout WikiLeaks\' previous releases.\n\n\"People raise this for distracting reasons, to try to question the messenger because the content itself is so powerful,\" he said.\n\nâ€”â€”â€”\n\nJILTED CONTRACTOR\n\nSpies go rogue for many reasons: money, a quest for fame, ego, they are coerced or compromised.\n\nWikiLeaks said the material came from an \"isolated high-security network\" inside the CIA\'s Center for Cyber Intelligence. The group said the material \"appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner\" and that one of them gave WikiLeaks part of this cache.\n\nAssange suggested that spies, former intelligence officials and contractors had been sharing the material, potentially to feed a growing for-profit market in electronic espionage tools. He said it appeared that not only was it being spread among contractors and former American computer hackers for hire, but \"now may be in the black market.\"\n\nTraditionally, money has been a key motive. But Frank Cilluffo, who directs the Center for Cyber and Homeland Security at George Washington University, thinks leakers might leak for different reasons today. \"If they were doing it to make money, why would they go to WikiLeaks?\" he asked.\n\nHe said Edward Snowden, a former contractor for the National Security Agency who leaked classified material exposing U.S. government surveillance programs, was not motivated by money. Likewise, Chelsea Manning, who was convicted of leaking many thousands of classified government and military documents to WikiLeaks while serving as an intelligence analyst in Iraq, said she did it not for money but to raise awareness about the war\'s impact on innocent civilians.\n\nâ€”â€”â€”\n\nFOREIGN MEDDLER\n\nIt\'s not impossible to imagine an insider walking out of the CIA with the data, said Bob Ayers, a retired U.S. intelligence officer currently working as an international security analyst based in England.\n\nBut Ayers, who appeared opposite Assange in a debate over whistleblowers in London several years ago, said his instincts are that a foreign country is involved. \"I think the Russians are behind it, I really do,\" he said.\n\nJames Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, also suspects a sleight of hand by the Kremlin, which he says has used WikiLeaks in the past.\n\nHe pointed to WikiLeaks\' statement about receiving the material from a source who thinks there needs to be a debate about whether the CIA\'s hacking exceeds its mandated powers. Lewis said the source who believed that the CIA had gained too much power \"probably lives in Moscow.\"\n\n\"There is a long-term campaign by the Russians to damage the U.S and the intelligence community,\" he said. \"It\'s too early to tell if this is another part of that â€” although it fits that pattern. I think the biggest concern is that we are in a new kind of fight with Russia and we are losing. The damage from lost tools can be repaired. The damage to reputation takes longer.\"\n\nAssange has long denied claims, often made on flimsy evidence, that he acts on behalf of Russian interests. Asked Thursday by an American journalist whether he had received any money from the Russian state, Assange said no and that it was a \"pretty sad question.\"\n\nAnd this past week, Russia Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov denied any Russian involvement in hacking.\n\nâ€”â€”â€”\n\nAMERICANS\' RIGHT TO KNOW\n\nWikiLeaks said the source of the documents wants to start a public debate about \"the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of cyber weapons.\"\n\nBen Wizner is Snowden\'s lawyer and the director of the Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project at the American Civil Liberties Union. He said if WikiLeaks is accurately representing the source\'s intentions, then there seems to be success in stirring a public debate about the balance between the need to protect networks used daily by Americans and the government\'s need to conduct surveillance operations against adversaries.\n\n\"To the extent that the documents help inform a public debate about what the balance should be between the government\'s offensive surveillance operations and defensive cybercapabilities, then the documents have contributed to an important public conversation,\" Wizner said.\n\nBut he also wondered whether the source wanted the documents released with parts blacked out. WikiLeaks has previously voiced disgust with the idea of censoring documents, even in part, saying that doing so \"legitimizes the false propaganda of \'information is dangerous.\'\"\n\nWikiLeaks has not answered questions from The Associated Press about why it applied redactions this time or whether it was done at the source\'s request. Knowing the answer to those questions, Wizner said, might help with understanding what motivated the release.\n\nâ€”â€”â€”\n\nAssociated Press writer Raphael Satter in London contributed to this report.',real

'NEW DELHI: The real threat to the Indian economy is from frauds, cheating and corruption which accounted for 74\% of all cases registered by the Enforcement Directorate in the last one year and not as much from drugs, narcotics or arms smuggling, according to a study conducted by the agency. About 83\% of all money laundering cases registered by the ED in the last one year are those related to financial institutions and real estate, and not linked to gold, arms or explosives catch. Gold related cases accounted for a mere 7\% while others were 10\%, the ED study said. In an example cited for corruption involving a senior IAS officer, the agency said the accused was aided by his chartered accountant to operate 446 benami bank accounts for 13 shell companies. The IAS officer had deposited Rs 39 crore in these accounts between 2006-09. The ED conducted the sample study as a risk assessment exercise focusing on cases booked by the agency post demonetisation between November 2016 and September 2017. It found that frauds and cheating were the two major threats to the Indian economy while the proceeds of crime were laundered through financial institutions using shell companies and investments in real estate. \"The vicious circle of illegal wealth is not only involved in domestic circular trading but has moved out of Indian borders. Banking channels are used and remittances are made using shell companies to avoid compliances. Such activities are known as trade based money laundering,\" the study said expressing concern on how regulatory mechanism has failed to curb generation of black money.

'A familiar name: Democrat Kennedy fights GOP on health care\nMARY CLARE JALONICK, ASSOCIATED PRESS\nt\nhttp://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/familiar-democratic-kennedy-fights-gop-health-care-46088499\nA familiar name from Massachusetts, Rep. Joe Kennedy III, is carrying his family legacy into a new era, battling Republicans who want to undo Barack Obama\'s health care law.\n\nKennedy, the 36-year-old grandson of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and great-nephew of the late Sen. Ted Kennedy and President John F. Kennedy, has been a low-key presence in the House since he was first elected in his Boston-area district in 2012. But he emerged last week as a major Democratic voice against the Republican health care bill, delivering several speeches in a committee\'s all-night session that have been viewed millions of times on the internet.\n\nWhile the technology may be new, his support for the Obama-era health care law and more services for the poor are familiar Kennedy territory. Sen. Ted Kennedy spent decades pushing for comprehensive health care before his death from brain cancer in August 2009.\n\nNow his great-nephew is fighting Republicans who are trying to unravel the 2010 law. They say the system is failing as premiums have risen and insurers have pulled out.\n\nKennedy challenged House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who had called the GOP replacement bill an \"act of mercy.\"\n\n\"With all due respect to our speaker, he and I must have read different scripture,\" Kennedy said during the debate. \"The one that I read calls on us to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, to shelter the homeless, and to comfort the sick. It reminds us that we are judged not by how we treat the powerful, but how we care for the least among us.\"\n\nHe added: \"This is not an act of mercy. It\'s an act of malice.\"\n\nHis office posted the video on Facebook, and as of Monday, it had almost 10 million views and more than 225,000 shares.\n\nKennedy acknowledged his family legacy but stressed that he can\'t allow it to overwhelm his actions.\n\n\"I obviously am very proud of what my family has accomplished and what they have done,\" he said in an interview, but \"if you try to do this job and carry that weight around, you\'re never going to be able to do anything.\"\n\nWhen talking about his grandfather\'s speeches, he is emotional, putting his hand on his heart. \"God, have you read some of his speeches?\" he asks, and notes that a one-minute viral clip is an easier task.\n\nIt\'s clear that he\'d rather be talking about the details of his opposition to the health bill.\n\nDuring the committee debate, he criticized the bill for its one-year freeze in Planned Parenthood funding, and the resulting decrease in health services for women, and the repeal of a requirement that state Medicaid plans must provide \"essential health benefits,\" including mental health care.\n\nA separate Facebook video of him talking about mental health care has more than 4 million views.\n\nThat issue is important in his family â€” mainly to his cousin, former Rep. Patrick Kennedy, who left Congress in 2011 and has since been open about his own battles with substance abuse and mental health.\n\nNow an advocate for increased mental health services, Patrick Kennedy says his cousin \"managed to capture a moment when all eyes were on health care, and focus it with laser precision.\"\n\nHe says Joe is the right person to carry on the family legacy.\n\n\"Most members have to be around for a long time and pay their dues before they garner the kind of credibility he\'ll have,\" Patrick said of Joe. \"The fact is, is he going to use that to good purpose? As he demonstrated this week, he is not only prepared but is using to good purpose that incredible family legacy he was given by birth.\"\n\nOne of Kennedy\'s good friends in Congress is Rep. Markwayne Mullin, a 39-year-old Oklahoma Republican who entered Congress with Kennedy four years ago and says he disagrees with the Massachusetts Democrat on almost everything. Mullin says they joke a lot, but they rarely joke about health care. They both sit on the Energy and Commerce Committee, where they took opposite sides on the bill last week.\n\n\"He doesn\'t speak out very often. He\'s not someone that is front and center,\" Mullin said. \"But health care is something that is very important to him.\"\n\nThe internet took notice, with retweets and Twitter shout-outs from Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former first daughter Chelsea Clinton and former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who tweeted: \"Wow. This is a Kennedy who could be President. A must watch.\" House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi cited his \"passion and his leadership.\"\n\nNew Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone, the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee and a lawmaker who worked with both Ted Kennedy and Patrick Kennedy before Joe came to Congress, says his party needs more young people talking about the benefits of the health care law, since many don\'t think it helps them.\n\nJoe Kennedy says millennials are engaged, apolitical, want the system to work and want solutions.\n\n\"Trying to get to some of the solutions here is difficult,\" Kennedy said. \"But we need to find a way to get there.\"',real
'Turkey-Netherlands feud simmers as Dutch election looms\nSUZAN FRASER, ASSOCIATED PRESS\nt\nhttp://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/turkey-formally-protests-ministers-treatment-netherlands-46088978\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel backed the Netherlands in its spat with Turkey on Monday as NATO\'s chief called for alliance members to respect each other and the European Union urged Turkey to calm down.\n\nThe flap is over the Netherlands\' refusal to allow Turkish officials to campaign there to drum up support among Turks who are eligible to vote in an April 16 referendum that would greatly expand the powers of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nErdogan\'s strong reaction to scenes of Dutch police repelling Turkish protesters is fueling nationalism back home and bolstering his image as a protector of Turkish people against a hostile world.\n\nOn Monday, Turkey\'s foreign ministry formally protested the treatment of a Turkish minister who was escorted out of the Netherlands after trying to attend a weekend referendum rally. The ministry also objected to what it called a \"disproportionate\" use of force against demonstrators at a protest afterward.\n\nTurkey had a similar dispute with Germany last week, but the fight with the Netherlands comes as that country prepares for its own election Wednesday pitting Prime Minister Mark Rutte\'s right-wing PVV Party against far-right, anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders\' party. Wilders had called on the Dutch government to bar Turkish ministers from the Netherlands until after the election.\n\nRutte, who did not want to be seen backing down to Turkish threats, enraged Ankara by refusing to let Turkey\'s foreign minister land in the Netherlands on Saturday and denying the country\'s family and social policies minister access to the Turkish Consulate in downtown Rotterdam.\n\nErdogan vowed to retaliate against the Netherlands after claiming that \"Nazism is alive in the West.\"\n\nMerkel, speaking at a news conference in Munich on Monday, pledged her \"full support and solidarity\" to the Dutch, saying the Nazi gibes were \"completely unacceptable.\"\n\nThe European Union called on Turkey to \"refrain from excessive statements and actions that risk further exacerbating the situation.\" EU spokesman Margaritis Schinas added that it was essential to avoid further escalation and find ways to calm the situation.\n\nTurkey is a candidate to join the European Union, although the membership negotiations have made little progress over the past decade. The country has become a vital partner in a deal with the EU to curb the passage of migrants and refugees from Turkey into Europe.\n\nOmer Celik, Turkey\'s minister in charge of European Union affairs, said Monday that his country should consider reviewing the migration deal to relax controls on people reaching Europe by walking into Greece or Bulgaria.\n\n\"In my opinion the issue of the land passages should be reviewed,\" the state-run Anadolu Agency quoted him as saying.\n\nMost of the hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees who flooded Europe in 2015 came by boat from Turkey to Greece, then traveled from there to more prosperous countries to the north and west. Celik said Turkey should continue preventing those crossings because they\'re dangerous.\n\nAlso Monday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg urged all members of the alliance \"to show mutual respect, to be calm and have a measured approach.\"\n\nThe Dutch, meanwhile, issued a travel advisory to their citizens to \"be alert and avoid gatherings and busy places throughout Turkey.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, Turkey summoned the Dutch Embassy\'s charge d\'affaires, Daan Feddo Huisinga, to the Foreign Ministry, where a senior official handed him two formal protest notes. It\'s the third time the Dutch diplomat has been summoned since tensions broke out between the two countries.\n\nThe first note protested the treatment of Family Affairs Minister Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya, who was escorted out of the Netherlands after she entered by road from Germany to try to attend a rally to support the referendum to expand Erdogan\'s powers. About 400,000 people with ties to Turkey live in the Netherlands, though it\'s not clear how many are eligible to vote.\n\nThe second note protested the treatment of Turkish citizens who had gathered outside the Turkish Consulate in Rotterdam from Saturday night into Sunday morning, saying \"disproportionate force\" had been used against \"people using their right to peaceful gatherings.\" At a separate protest by Turks in Amsterdam on Sunday night, Dutch riot police arrested 13 people, spokeswoman Marjolein Koek said. Media showed police with dogs and a water cannon being used to disperse protesters in western Amsterdam.\n\nâ€”â€”â€”\n\nAssociated Press Writers Mike Corder in Rotterdam, Netherlands, and Raf Casert in Brussels contributed to this report.',real
'NEW DELHI: As many as 475 out of 543 Lok Sabha MPs have not yet identified the village they would adopt for development under Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (SAGY), in what indicates a steady decline in interest in the central scheme that was launched by PM Narendra Modi with much fanfare. Only 68 Lok Sabha MPs chosen villages for Phase-3 of SAGY in 2017 while a paltry 13 Rajya Sabha members out of 245 have named the villages they would want to focus on for development. The numbers are too thin to suggest that the PM\'s scheme has gained popularity as has been pointed out by government managers over time. Under SAGY, each MP from the two chambers has to identify a gram panchayat in his constituency to be turned into a model of development. The scheme provides for no separate budget but aims at convergence of ongoing government schemes to improve infrastructure and standard of living in villages. The timeline laid down that Phase-1 would finish by 2016 and two more gram panchayats would be developed by 2019. In what seems an expression of concern, the Union rural development ministry presented the lack of progress in Phase-3 of SAGY at the Performance Review Committee (PRC) meeting last week. Sources said with personal letters from RD minister Narendra Singh Tomar failing to move MPs, the Centre at the PRC review urged states to ensure that district administrations now meet Parliament members to persuade them to join the scheme. Since the PM launched SAGY in 2014, it has been a story of constant dip in interest among MPs. While as many as 500 LS MPs identified villages in Phase-1, a high number of 203 Rajya Sabha MPs evinced interest too. But since then, the graph has moved south. In Phase-2, 234 LS members and 136 of 243 RS members failed to identify villages. The numbers have dipped alarmingly in Phase-3. According to officials, the source of indifference towards the scheme has been its design which does not provide for a budget but seeks convergence of existing schemes. Also, parliamentarians, especially those from the lower House, worry that picking one village in the constituency would trigger hostility among other villages, and cost them politically. Insiders said a basic flaw in the scheme was that MPs were being asked to focus on micro-level monitoring work in gram panchayats, which is the domain of MLAs, thereby triggering a conflict between central and state legislators.

'A UPS driver was delivering packages in Clackamas, Oregon, on Monday when he heard what sounded like a woman screaming inside a residence.The driver, Lee Purdy, paused on the street to listen. Sure enough, once again, he heard, \"Help! Help!\" He didn\'t know what was going on.He called his wife and explained the unusual situation. He told her he wasn\'t sure the voice sounded real. But she called 911 just to be safe.\"It was clearly weighing on him, so she thought she\'d better call,\" Brian Jensen, public information officer for the Clackamas County Sheriff\'s Office, told CBS News.When deputy Hayden Sanders arrived at the scene, he didn\'t find a woman in distress.

'As I trundled down the hilly road with a carefree gait, enjoying the scenic beauty around me, I came across a group of young men. Quickly, I averted my gaze. Much to my surprise, they greeted me with a namaste and I was left with no other option but to respond. The brief interaction ended here, but what startled me was my hesitation in replying. My apprehensive behaviour made me wonder whether I would have reacted the same way if they were foreigners. Perhaps not. Then why did I feel alarmed by local men? How did I cultivate the behaviour of mistrust? Had living in Delhi conditioned me to look away to avoid lewd gestures? I wasn’t sure. But I knew one thing: the blinkers that I wear whenever I am on the road needed to be taken off. And since I had embarked on my first solo trip to Kasar Devi, Uttarakhand, I should be more open to the world and keep personal biases aside.I had stumbled upon this idyllic hamlet in Almora quite accidently. Its ‘hippie’ history was more intriguing to me than its religious significance — that it gets its name from the revered Kesar Devi temple. Several hippies thronged this place — also known as Crank’s Ridge — in the 1960s. Bob Dylan was here too and so was Swami Vivekananda, but only to meditate. Over the years, it has become a popular hub for backpackers and trekkers.My intention wasn’t trekking as I had come here during the monsoon, a time unsuitable for any such adventurous expedition. Still, I was one among few who had dared to brave landslides. Day one was spent mostly in discovering the hidden corners of the village — homestays, general stores, schools and village trails. The flowers were in full bloom and the trees, bathed in fresh dew, seemed inviting. Quietude had descended over the place and it was devoid of tourists. It almost looked as if I had arrived at a party before time. As evening drew close, the stillness of the day was broken by the shrill sound of insects. Their symphony made the walk towards my homestay on a starless night magical.Next morning, I woke up to the sound of rain. The room opened to spectacular views of the Panchachuli, though a mist of clouds enveloped the majestic hills during my entire stay otherwise. I decided to explore Jageshwar temple next, which was about 35 kms where I was staying. Once the rain stopped, I stepped out, travelling in local buses and jeeps to reach my destination. While travelling, I always use public transport: one, it makes the trip budget-friendly and, two, using public modes of commuting allows one to come out of the cocoon of isolation and mistrust that most city-dwellers have woven around them. I was no exception.However, my heart sank when I reached the temple, comprising a cluster of 124 large and small stone temples. Mindless construction of shops and restaurants around the temple had clearly disturbed its tranquility. The only consolation was to look into its intricate details and the painstakingly carved human and animal figures on the stones. But the prize discovery of this trip turned out to be a walk from the main road to the temple amid thick deodar and pine trees. While their tall branches kissed the sky, rays of fading sunlight struggled to filter through the canopy of trees. Meditative and quaint, a stream flowing steadily by gave me constant company.So absorbed was I in the moment that I lost track of time. It was well past afternoon. The frequency of buses and jeeps reduces drastically after 2 pm, I was told, and, as I waited patiently, I struck up a conversation with a local who spoke about the region’s flora and fauna. Time was ticking away and there was no bus in sight. I was getting anxious. ‘Would you mind going with a local?’ he asked. I had no option but to agree. Within 10 minutes, he stopped a young guy on a scooty and I soon found myself riding pillion. We talked nonchalantly, and a soft smile refused to leave my lips until I reached my homestay. Throughout the ride I kept thinking, ‘Finally, I did leave my blinkers behind. Even if it’s only for a day.”',real

Sinha said the GB’s resolution, finalising the college name, has been sent to the DU Vice-Chancellor, who will take “necessary action” and give formal approval.On September 21, Dyal Singh (Evening) principal Pawan K Sharma had received a notification that the Executive Council has given approval to the evening college becoming a full-fledged day college. While the college has shifted to morning timings — both for official work and classes — a DU-appointed committee is in the process of demarcating and sharing physical assets of the two colleges. Even on Friday, some teachers and students protested against the bifurcation process, outside the GB meeting venue.The college was earlier considering the name, ‘Madan Mohan Malviya College’. It is currently named after Dyal Singh Majithia, who founded the The Tribune newspaper in 1881 and the Punjab National Bank in 1894. The college website says Majithia also set up an education trust in 1895 for a “truly secular college”, and DSC was born out of that trust.Explaining why ‘Vande Mataram Mahavidyalaya’ was chosen over ‘Madan Mohan Malviya College’, Sinha told The Indian Express, “Woh (Malviya) kiske bachche the? Hum unhi ko pranaam kar rahe hain. Maa ka darza sabse upar hota hai aur unhe pranaam karna hai. (Whose child was Malviya? We are paying respect to her. The stature of the mother is above all else). Vande mataram means to pay obeisance to the mother. There is no politics in the name.”',real

'LOS ANGELES -- A Mexican soap star slapped a reporter on the red carpet when the actor took umbrage to a question about his son.CBS Los Angeles spoke to another entertainment reporter who was on the red carpet, who said the actor -- telenovela star Eduardo Yanez -- has a reputation for often being angry with reporters.He and the reporter -- Paco Fuentes -- were quipping and joking moments before the slap. The actor seemed to turn on a dime.The slap happened in Hollywood on Tuesday evening.The reporter asked the actor why the actor\'s son had set up a GoFundMe page to pay for a car he had crashed instead of asking his dad for the money.That question clearly set the actor off.He said, in Spanish, \"If you\'re so worried about my son, you send him the money or go talk to him.\"Fuentes replied that the people, the audience cared, and he was just the messenger.Yanez told him that that was a lie -- he was the one trying to make a big deal out of it. Yanez accused Fuentes of being disrespectful.Fuente said he wasn\'t trying to be disrespectful -- and Yanez slapped him hard. The slap is going viral.Lupita Herrera was on the red carpet.\"I was in shock,\" she said, \"I didn\'t know what to do.\"She said she spoke to Yanez immediately before Fuentes and she asked the same question about his son.Herrera says he got angry with her question as well, but couldn\'t believe he slapped Fuentes.\"In my opinion,\" she said, \"Fuentes was just doing his job.

'Guests inside Jerry Lynn\'s Pittsburgh-area home may think their ears are ringing if they stick around long enough.At exactly the same time every evening, the ringing begins -- well, beeping, actually.The noise often startles people as they relax on the couches in their living room. But it\'s something Jerry Lynn and his wife, Sylvia, have grown accustomed to over the years.Thirteen years ago, Lynn was doing some home repairs when he got the idea to dangle an alarm clock, which was attached to a string, through an air vent on the second floor. He set the timer for 10 minutes, hoping the sound would give him a clue as to where to drill a hole in the living room wall to pass a wire through for a TV cable.\"I thought it was convenient at the time,\" Lynn told CBS Pittsburgh.Little did he know, the plan was about to unravel.As Lynn lowered the clock down, the string snapped. The clock crashed to the ground.\"As I was laying it down, all of a sudden I hear it go \'thunk!\' as it came loose,\" Lynn said. \"I thought, well, that\'s not a real problem.

'JERUSALEM -- While Albert Einstein\'s theory of happiness may be relative, it fetched $1.3 million at a Jerusalem auction on Tuesday.The Nobel-winning scientist\'s musings, handwritten on a note, may not be as famous as his groundbreaking theory of relativity, but they still shed light on one of the great modern minds.Winner\'s Auctions and Exhibitions said Einstein was traveling in Japan in 1922 when he was told he would be awarded the Nobel Prize in physics. In Tokyo, Einstein scribbled the note in German to a bellboy after he did not have cash to give him a tip.\"A calm and modest life brings more happiness than the pursuit of success combined with constant restlessness,\" it reads.Gal Wiener, CEO of the auction house, said Einstein told the bellboy that because of his fame, the handwritten note \"will probably be worth more than a regular tip.\"Wiener said bidding began at $2,000 and quickly escalated, with the bidding war lasting around 25 minutes.Another note Einstein gave the bellboy, which read \"Where there\'s a will there\'s a way,\" was sold for over $200,000, Wiener said.He would not identify the buyer or seller of either note.Einstein was a founder of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and left it his literary estate and personal papers.

'Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil love Arsenal and want to stay but money will decide whether they renew their contracts with the club, manager Arsene Wenger said on Saturday.Both players’ deals expire in the summer and Wenger has previously admitted the pair could be sold during the January transfer window.Sanchez scored in the 2-0 Premier League win over Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday.“I am convinced they love the club and love the team, but all the rest will be decided, when? I don’t really know,” Wenger told reporters.“I believe they love the club and want to stay, but there are other top clubs out there who offer good contracts as well.”When asked if the rousing manner of Arsenal’s win over Tottenham could convince Sanchez and Ozil to stay, Wenger added:“It’s not enough, because the quality of the contract has to be good and enough for them.“The quality of the contract is part of it. The whole thing has to be right and they have to be happy.”Sanchez’s close-range strike sealed victory for Arsenal over Tottenham after Shkodran Mustafi had headed the open goal five minutes earlier.The result lifted Arsenal to fifth in the Premier League, one point behind Tottenham, and earned them a first victory in the north London derby in seven attempts.“We played with purpose, good concentration, the desire to be always efficient and with great solidarity from the first to last minute,” Wenger said.“The quality of our concentration was very high. We never had a minute where we could feel we dropped a little bit our focus.”Mustafi’s goal came with a double dose of controversy. The free kick from which he scored was given for a disputable foul by Davinson Sanchez on Sanchez and replays showed Mustafi was marginally offside.“Two weeks ago we conceded a goal that was not marginally offside, it was a yard offside, and nobody found a word to say,” Wenger said.“I watched it again (Mustafi’s goal) – it’s not true that he was offside.

'WAIAPI, Brazil: Deep in the Amazon rainforest, it\'s that time again -- beer o\'clock. Members of the tiny, remote Waiapi tribe in Brazil\'s eastern Amazon raise calabash gourds to their painted faces and quaff the homemade brew they call caxiri. Draining the salad-bowl-sized gourd, usually in one go, they send for a refill, which is scooped from an enormous hollowed-out log resembling a canoe, only brimming with beer. The tribesmen of Manilha village, dressed in red loincloths, black-and-red body art, and sashes made of bright beads, soon get merrily drunk. A Waiapi man aims bow and arrow at the Waiapi indigenous reserve in the Manilha village, in Amapa state, Brazil. (APF photo) The party, which kicks off after lunch and continues late into the star-filled night, was called in honor of the Waiapi river spirit, a giant anaconda-like serpent called Sucuri who demands constant appeasement. But the Waiapi need little excuse to organise drinking sessions, preferably with a sing-song. \"When you drink, your vision changes. You lose shame. Happiness comes and your feet start moving,\" says Japarupi Waiapi, a 45-year-old chief visiting from a neighboring community. As the caxiri flows, the music picks up. Half a dozen men play bamboo flutes, others sing, and everyone takes turns to blow on a giant flute made from an embauba, or trumpet tree, about three yards (meters) long. \"We play the flutes so that Sucuri is happy and doesn\'t snatch people when they swim,\" Japarupi Waiapi says. \"The river is very important. We use it to fish, to wash, to play in.\" Wiping his mouth after a deep drink of caxiri, the Waiapi chief thinks of another, entirely logical reason why the river spirit deserves honoring. \"If there were no river, there\'d be no party.\" The Waiapi are self-sufficient, able to do without electricity, phones, cars, most clothes or even money. But while everything they need for survival can be found in the forest, daily life as hunters and subsistence farmers can be grueling. Caxiri is their one luxury. Sometimes the tribesmen start in the morning for a casual sitdown and couple pints. Sometimes it\'s an elaborate affair, a full-blown party, with other villages invited and going on all night. \"These caxiri bouts were mentioned by numerous travellers in French Guiana in the 1800s. There is no doubt that getting drunk was an important Wayapi tradition,\" wrote anthropologist Alan Tormaid Campbell, who lived with the Waiapi in the 1970s, learned their language, and wrote a 2002 book \"Getting to know Waiwai.\" Behind the scenes, though, it takes back-breaking work to make the tradition happen. And women, who drink caxiri in lesser quantities, are responsible. Caxiri is brewed from cassava or yams, with beige or purple versions, coming in varying degrees of potency. The cassava, also used to make tapioca, is harvested from a small plantation in a patch of cleared forest outside Manilha, where, lacking tree cover, the sun pounds ferociously. Women get there by crossing a river, then hiking with tall backpacks woven from palm leaves, which they fill with tubers, before returning under the staggering weight. Then in the village, the laborious process of grating, boiling, straining, wringing, baking, fermenting and otherwise transforming the cassava begins. The resulting beverage looks closer to soup than beer. Eriana Waiampi, 48, who like the other women on the expedition was topless and carried a machete, shrugged off the idea that this might not be worth the trouble. \"We are women. We are warriors to carry cassava,\" she said. Within hours, the revellers at Manilha\'s party had drunk their way through the entire canoe of beer. Fortunately, a second canoe load awaited at the other end of the village. The increasingly enthusiastic musicians, huddling together and holding on to each other, played the same two notes over and over in a tireless, hypnotic rhythm. Dancing in a bobbing motion, they shuffled through the village like mad pipers. First they visited Manilha\'s elderly chief who reclined in his hammock, singing along. Next, they visited the women, who drank in a rather less frenzied way. At sundown, darkness swallowed the entire village, leaving only scattered points of firelight. But the party went on. The musicians kept dancing and blowing, while men and women laughed and told stories around a central fire. One rather tipsy tribesman, covered in traditional Waiapi ink designs, reenacted a hunting scene, extending his arms to demonstrate the size of some recent prize. Aka\'upotye Waiapi, 43 and eldest son of the chief, looked content. Caxiri isn\'t just a way to get drunk, he said. It\'s a way to bind Waiapi to their ancient ways and to keep the young from straying to the temptations of Brazilian towns. \"If we don\'t keep our culture through caxiri, the young will go there to drink non-Indian drinks,\" he said. \"Lose caxiri and we lose our culture.\" As the stars thickened over the rainforest and the night frogs chorused, guests began to drift off to their hammocks. A few risked waking up to headaches, but no worry, Japarupi Waiapi said. The tribe has its own cure, a concoction of cassava, a cassava extract called tucupi and pepper. \"Drink that,\" he said, \"and no hangover.\" Get latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.',real

'An Insignificant Man movie director: Khushboo Ranka, Vinay Shukla \r\nAn Insignificant Man movie rating: 3 starsIt’s not just the events that An Insignificant Man captures, important though they are in many ways, that makes this feature length documentary significant.Of course, it is in the very subject. It is about politics, and it is deeply political. But equally, it is in the very fact of it being released for public exhibition this week. Films in India run the risk of denied certification on the flimsiest of excuses, and this one is a hot potato: an up close, detailed record of the formation of a political party which was born out of citizen protests, and out of a very vocal dissatisfaction with the system, and widespread corruption in its very fabric.The directors are clearly present, and yet keep themselves out of the frame, except in one or two inadvertent flashes. What they, and we, get is a fascinating account of how a brand new political entity comes about, from grounds up. The Aam Aadmi Party was born out of protest and a strong egalitarian sense of right and wrong: here were the ‘aam aadmi’’, and there were those who were in power, and there was a huge rift in between.The major dramatis personae are, of course, Arvind Kejriwal and his early lieutenants (some, like the analyst Yogendra Yadav, are no longer part of AAP, having been expelled for ‘anti-party activities’). From a tax officer to a protestor, to an activist, to a reluctant rookie politician, to winning an election, and to becoming the chief minister of New Delhi, the film is the journey of Kejriwal, and his AAP.Because no other party gives access to the filmmakers (this is mentioned in the credits), except for televised excerpts and public meetings, the film has Kejriwal and co in focus: in conversation with potential voters, in a rare relaxed moment, in strategizing, and finally, in the historic win at the hustings.That a day can be a long time in politics is evident right during the film itself: was Yadav already distancing himself from Kejriwal even before the formal parting of ways? The film shows Yadav in the crowd, far away from the dais, where Kejriwal is taking oath. Is Kejriwal really, in his heart, a small, insignificant man (‘main toh ek bahut chota aadmi hoon’, he repeats in the film), when he starts off? Was he always really the autocrat that so many people accuse him of being, or does being in power does that to him? Then how is he or his party different from those he fought?Even for those who were following the events very closely on a day to day basis, the film is a bracing refresh: the sense of wild exhilaration that even the most cynical amongst us felt, when AAP swept the elections in 2013, dissipated soon after as the party fell from grace. In events that followed, it resurrected itself, and won Delhi again.Right now, AAP still rules Delhi. But how many of us still feel as thrilled as we did when it first beat the mighty old parties (Congress, BJP) on the plank of corruption, and the chants of we-will-change-everything?',real
'A smiling Roy Moore stood shoulder to shoulder with his fiercest religious allies.Flanked by a huge sign for Moore’s Senate campaign, one supporter railed against the “LGBT mafia” and “homosexualist gay terrorism.” Another warned that “homosexual sodomy” destroys those who participate in it and the nations that allow it. And still another described same-sex marriage as “a mirage” because “it’s phony and fake.”Thursday’s news conference was designed to send a powerful message to the political world that religious conservatives across America remain committed to Moore, a Christian conservative and former judge whose Alabama Senate campaign has been rocked by mounting allegations of sexual misconduct. The event also revealed an aggressive strain of homophobia rarely seen in mainstream politics _ in recent years, at least.In the days since, religious liberals have stepped forward to express their opposition to Moore. More than 50 Alabama pastors signed a letter saying Moore has demonstrated “extremist values” incompatible with traditional Christianity and is unfit to serve in the Senate. And an anti-Moore rally at a Birmingham church on Saturday drew more than 100 people, some of whom carried signs decrying his opposition to gay rights.But in a Senate campaign suddenly hyper focused on Moore’s relationships with teenage girls decades ago, Moore’s hardline stance on gay rights and other LGBT issues has become little more than an afterthought for many voters as Election Day approaches.Moore first caught the attention of many in the LGBT community after describing homosexual conduct as “an inherent evil against which children must be protected” in a 2002 child custody case involving a lesbian mother. In a 2005 television interview, Moore said “homosexual conduct should be illegal.” He also said there’s no difference between gay sex and sex with a cow, horse or dog.Moore’s stand _ combined with the fiery comments from his supporters _ unnerved some in Birmingham’s relatively small LGBT community.“It made me extremely angry,” said Mackenzie Gray, a 37-year-old who came out as transgender in 2010. She says most people in her life don’t know she was born a man.“My fear with the religious leaders and the hateful rhetoric we’re hearing is that it’s going to start escalating into something even larger,” Gray said. “It’s dangerous.”Indeed, other LGBT activists suggested this week that open acceptance of Moore’s anti-gay rhetoric harkens to a dark and violent time in Alabama history.Moore’s Democratic challenger, Doug Jones, is known best, perhaps, for prosecuting the men who bombed Birmingham’s 16th Street Baptist Church _ a prosecution that came nearly 40 years after the 1963 crime that killed four black girls. Racial tensions have lingered in the state, even as the violence lessened. In 2000, Alabama became the last state in the country to overturn its ban on interracial marriage.The state has been slow to embrace gay rights as well: 81 percent of voters supported a ban on same-sex marriage in 2006. Only neighboring Mississippi, with 86 percent, scored higher.Patricia Todd, the state’s first openly gay state representative, says she has faced at least four death threats in recent years. One woman called Todd’s cell phone and vowed to kill her and her family, she said, noting that local LGBT leaders meet quarterly at the FBI office in Birmingham to help identify potential hate crimes.“It’s been brutal, but it’s gotten to the point where I just laugh at them,” Todd said Friday. She’s not laughing at Moore.“It’s awful because he says the most hateful things,” she said.In contrast to many conservative politicians with national ambitions, Moore has made little attempt to change his tone on LGBT issues as equal rights for the gay community has earned increasing acceptance among mainstream America.Moore’s hero status among many Christian conservatives was cemented in 2016 when, as the chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, he refused to comply with a Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. He was later suspended, the second time he was forcibly removed from the state Supreme Court.Earlier this month, Moore said, “The transgenders don’t have rights,” during a news conference, according to the Montgomery Advertiser.Moore’s unapologetic positions _ and his repeated promises to take them to the U.S. Senate if elected on Dec. 12 _ were celebrated at Thursday’s news conference by the religious leaders who traveled from as far as Colorado, Ohio and Texas to stand at his side.Rabbi Noson Leiter, who once called Hurricane Sandy’s destruction “divine justice” for same-sex marriage, lashed out at “homosexualist gay terrorism.”“We need Judge Moore to stand up to the LGBT transgender mafia,” Leiter said. He added, “We need someone with a proven record of facing off against the gay terrorists.”Another Moore supporter, Texas Christian activist Steven Hotze, warned in 2015 that children would be “encouraged to practice sodomy in kindergarten” as a result of same-sex marriage. On Thursday, Hotze refused to describe the union of two gay people as marriage: “It’s ‘mirage’ because it’s just like a mirage _ it’s phony and it’s fake.”North Carolina-based Christian activist Flip Benham last year warned in a Charlotte City Council meeting that the policies that protect the civil rights of transgender people would trigger “bloodshed coursing down the corners of our streets.”“We’re praising everything that God says is wrong and will destroy you,” he said Thursday. “Homosexual sodomy destroys those who participate in that behavior and nations that approve of it.”He offered a pointed message to Moore’s critics: God “doesn’t send anyone to hell. It’s a place you choose to go.”',real

This means the iPhone X will be easy to hold for a lot of users and thus have a better acceptability than Apple’s Plus range phone.The phone has a distinct steel frame, which in the space grey model is a dark and blends well into the rest of the phone. In fact, the phone has no edges and this steel frame melds into the edge-to-edge display. But while the phone is touted as bezel-less there is a thing frame that is visible where the screen meets the frame, unlike on the Samsung phones where the screen bends into the curves. Yes, there is no Home button here. But the power button and the volume buttons stay where they are in the other recent Apple phone. There is a speaker grille at the bottom, flanking the lightning port. The other significant change is at the rear where the dual camera bump is now vertical, unlike the iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 8 Plus where it is horizontal. The bump is pretty much the same height as in the iPhone 8 Plus. This phone too has a glass back where you can clearly see your fingerprints. While this is a significant design diversion from what Apple has been doing for the past few years, it is a necessity for wireless charging to work. Though the phone has the strongest glass ever put on a smartphone, it also means you need to protect the back… just in case.The Apple iPhone X is the first iPhone to sport a Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen. Apple has always wanted to try AMOLED, but it’s become good enough and affordable enough only now. So along with the ~82.9 per cent screen-to-body ratio, the 5.8-display is the brightest ever on an iPhone and has the most PPI density at 458. All this goes on to make the iPhone X’s a stunning screen.However, this is not a regular screen for the true depth camera eats into the screen as you are watching most types of videos. This not an issue on YouTube, but for iTunes movies you will need to live with the camera in your frame with the video wrapping around it. But still you will notice that the display is much crisper than the iPhone 8 and maybe a bit mellower and it appears to be warmer. One of the biggest changes in the iPhone X is the lack of a home button. Apple is using gestures to help navigate without the Home button and has replaced the fingerprint scanner with FaceID. The new FaceID feature, which uses the TrueDepth camera to read your face, can also be used to make App Store purchases and to auto-fill forms on Safari. The FaceID setup process is simple and once this is done you realise who fast and convenient FaceID is. As soon as you face the phone it is unlocked for you to swipe and reach the home page. I would have loved the unlock to take you directly to the homepage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\tif(typeof(jQuery)==\"function\"){(function($){$.fn.fitVids=function(){}})(jQuery)};\r\n\t\t\t\tjwplayer(\'jwplayer_UMBSMvfN_xe0BVfqu_div\').setup(\r\n\t\t\t\t{\"playlist\":\"http:\\/\\/vidshare.indianexpress.com\\/jw6\\/UMBSMvfN.xml\"}\r\n\t\t\t);\r\n\t\t\r\nBut for me the best use of the FaceID is where it auto fills passwords on most of the apps I have logged into before. This is so convenient for someone like me who struggles to remember passwords. Also, FaceID does not need you to be a well-lit area to unlock the phone and works most of the time. For me, FaceID has worked almost always and is a good enough reason to pick up this phone.With home button gone, iPhone X users will need to get themselves used to some gestures. To get to home you swipe up right from the bottom of the screen, do the same swipe and hold your finger at the middle of the screen to see running apps and drag down from top right corner to get the control centre. All easy, but it does take a bit of time of a regular iPhone user like me to not find the home button below the screen. In fact, I struggled more to take screenshots, something I keep doing all day. That is now executed by holding down the power and volume up bottom at the same time. Siri needs a long press of the power button. Yes, this took a couple of days to get used to.The iPhone X is one of the most powerful phones you can buy at the moment and that is not about having a 8GB RAM or a graphic processor on coke. The phone’s A11 Bionic chip works really well with the software to offer a smooth experience all the time. Yes, there have been a couple of app crashes in the week I used the phone, but they were not because of the phone couldn’t handle it, but more because the app in question had issues.The phone can cleary handle the day-to-day stuff. But then the A11 chip is made for much more. So the dual camera processing is much faster than it was on the iPhone 7 Plus, for instance. Also, if you use the FaceID in the middle of the night and it unlocks in a flash, you know there is something this phone is doing right. Also when you use Apple’s fun new Animojis, the processor is working over time to convert you facial movement into animation using the TrueDepth camera and it does not so much as break a sweat.Apple knows the iPhone X is a phone that needs some extra protection and has hence released its first folio cover with the phone. It’s an expensive piece of leather at Rs 8,600. However, while on Android phones you would dial, close the flap and start talking, you can’t do the same on the iPhone. Becase as soon as you close the flap, the call terminates. So if you have invested in the iPhone X folio, you will need to hold the flap back. I am not sure this Folio will be successful.The Apple iPhone X has slightly larger battery than the iPhone 8 Plus, despite the smaller build. However, it also has a beter screen, more powerful processor and a front camera that needs to constantly look for a face to reckon with. I was expecting the battery life to be a pain point on the iPhone X. But that is certainly not the case.Using the iPhone X over the past week, I have not had to charge the phone during any of the days. In fact, I have come back home with about 20 per cent charge left on all days on which I have left home with over 80 per cent charge. And this is really good for a use like me who is always looking for a charging point, even with the brand new iPhone 8 Plus.The phone has been relatively cool through the week and I think is thermal control is helping maintian the battery really well. While Apple just says that the batter is about 20 per cent better than the iPhone 7 series it is certainly better than the iPhone 8 series too in my books. However, these are early days and usually issues with the battery crop after a few weeks of use. Apple iPhone X gestures and how to kill running appsThe Apple iPhone cameras are already at a spot where there is very little competition. Of course, there is the Google Pixel series and the top-end Samsung’s that are really good, but the iPhone is still the most popular camera out there. With the iPhone X, Apple seems to have plugged one weakness of its cameras. The iPhone X has the best front camera ever put on an Apple device and it comes with the full Portrait mode, even though the dual camera is limited to the rear. The iPhone X uses the TrueDepth camera that Apple uses up front for FaceID to create selfies that comes with more character than before.The Portrait mode is the same as the one on dual cameras, but here again, the TrueDepth is what helps add the extra layer of detail and depth of field. Apple could change the way selfies are taken with the phone and I personally think that would be better than beautified selfies.The rear camera, on the other hand, is very similar to the one on the iPhone 8 Plus. But this is better as it has an f2.4 lens. So it clearly performs better in low light and reduces noises in such photos. It also offers great colour like the 8 Plus.I did not really get to travel with the iPhone X and Delhi is not really the place for photographers. However, whatever I have shot so far has me impressed. However, if you are buying this just for the camera, I would suggest you to take a look at the iPhone 8 Plus too as the difference is not that much.The Apple iPhone X is the clearly the best phone Apple has produced in a while, both in terms of innovation and functionality. However, I am not sure this is the phone for all Apple fans. This works best for those who don’t mind the price tag, needs a compact phone that is also powerful and comes with a superb camera. If you just need a good iPhone then both the iPhone 7 and 8 series are more than sufficient and will also save you a lot of money. However, if you are already on the iPhone 7 series and want to upgrade then it makes no sense to buy the iPhone 8 series now. For you the iPhone X offers enough in terms of new and future-proofed features.Also, I will not recommend this phone for those who have a history of wrecking their devices. This is hard phone to take care of and you should get a good cover even before you step out of the store.',real
'MAR DEL PLATA (Argentina): A multinational armada of aircraft and vessels battled high winds and raging seas Sunday as they intensified their search for a missing Argentine submarine, after apparent attempted distress calls raised hopes the 44 crew members may still be alive. There has been no contact with the ARA San Juan, a German-built diesel-electric sub, since early Wednesday. An air and sea search is under way with help from countries including Brazil, Britain, Chile, the United States and Uruguay. Hopes of finding survivors were revived when the navy said Saturday that its bases had received seven satellite calls attributed to the submersible. The signals were received at 10:52 am (1352 GMT) and 3:42 pm (1842 GMT), but they did not lock in, thus preventing a full connection. However, the navy was unable to confirm that those calls originated from the submarine. \"The communications are so short and the signal so low,\" Argentine navy spokesman Enrique Balbi said, later adding the military has yet to have contact with or detect radar from the sub. The calls revived hopes that the submarine has surfaced, but a powerful storm that has whipped up waves reaching seven meters (23 feet) in height has made geolocation difficult, officials said. Balbi said weather conditions were not expected to improve before Tuesday. Despite the bad weather, \"10 aircraft, both domestic and foreign, are in a search rotation 24 hours a day, each in a different area,\" he said. There is a feeling of \"cautious enthusiasm,\" naval expert Fernando Morales told C5N television. He said the attempt to use a satellite phone indicates that \"the submarine had to emerge to a depth that allowed the call.\" The last regular communication with the San Juan was early Wednesday, when the submarine was 430 kilometers (270 miles) off Argentina\'s coast in the Gulf of San Jorge. Rescuers are focusing on an ocean patch about 300 kilometers in diameter, radiating from the last point of contact. US Southern Command has deployed a Navy P-8A Poseidon patrol and reconnaissance plane with a crew of 21, along with a NASA P-3 research aircraft, and other equipment and personnel. The US Navy has deployed two unmanned underwater vehicles that use a sonar system to create an image of large sections of the sea floor. Britain\'s Royal Navy said it had sent the HMS Protector, an Antarctic patrol ship. Balbi said it was following the northward course the submarine would have taken toward Mar del Plata. Relatives of crew members unfurled a flag at the naval base that read: \"Be strong Argentina, We trust in God, We wait for you.\" \"We will do what is necessary to find the submarine as soon as possible,\" Argentine President Mauricio Macri wrote on Twitter. All land communications bases along the coast were ordered to scan for any follow-up signals, as family members of the missing waited nervously in the coastal city of Mar del Plata. Claudio Rodriguez, whose brother Hernan is aboard the submarine, was hopeful, saying the satellite signals suggested the vessel was still afloat and would be found. \"They\'ve got to be afloat. Thank God,\" he said. Among those on board is Argentina\'s first female submarine officer, 35-year-old weapons officer Eliana Krawczyk. The navy has not ruled out any hypothesis. A spokesman said the most likely scenario given is that an electrical problem may have unexpectedly cut off the vessel\'s communications. The TR-1700 class submarine had been returning from a routine mission to Ushuaia, near the southernmost tip of South America, to its base at Mar del Plata, about 400 kilometers south of Buenos Aires. It is one of three submarines in the Argentine fleet. Sixty-five meters long and seven meters wide, it was built by Germany\'s Thyssen Nordseewerke and launched in 1983. It underwent a refit between 2007 and 2014 to extend its use by about 30 years. At the Vatican, Argentine-born Pope Francis said he offered \"his fervent prayer\" for the safety of the submarine sailors.

'PHOENIX -- An oldies country music radio station serving a rural Arizona area that aired a public service announcement for two years telling people how to hide potential evidence in child pornography cases has stopped doing so after advertisers received threats, the station\'s owner said Wednesday.Cochise County Sheriff Mark Dannels said he formally opened an investigation Tuesday that includes seeking legal advice from the county attorney on whether charges can be filed in connection with the public service announcement, CBS affiliate KPHO reports.KAVV-FM owner Paul Lotsof said in an interview that he does not like child pornography but created the announcement because he thinks Arizona\'s 10-year minimum sentence for each image of child porn is too harsh and costly for taxpayers.\"Nobody put me up to it, and nobody paid,\" he said. \"My feeling is that these people don\'t deserve life in prison just because they have pictures of naked juveniles.\"But recent public comment about the announcement was \"99.9 percent\" negative and some radio station advertisers received threats, he said. The signal of the radio station from the small southeastern Arizona city of Benson beams across a wide area that stretches toward the Mexico border.\'The announcement described Arizona\'s tough penalties for possession of child pornography and then provides advice on how to avoid convictions.It said: \"If you have such material, you can save yourselves and your family a ton of grief and save the taxpayers a lot of money by never storing such pictures on the hard drive of your computer. Always use an external drive and hide it where nobody will ever find it. Likewise, never keep paper pictures, tapes or films of naked juveniles where anybody else can find them.\"The announcement drew the attention of local law enforcement officials, with Cochise County Sheriff Mark Dannels calling it \"disgusting and unacceptable\" and encouraging \"evil behavior.\"3TV | CBS 5KPHO reports that Dannels said Lotsof is \"enticing people and providing the information that says, \'Hey, if you\'re going to look at child porn, this is what you need to do so the cop doesn\'t catch you.\' ... Freedom of speech does not include telling people to commit crimes.\"But Cochise County Attorney Brian McIntyre said it was protected by the U.S. Constitution\'s First Amendment safeguarding free speech.\"This individual just happens to have a platform that maybe others don\'t and is advocating beliefs that are personally repugnant to me,\" McIntyre said.The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which regulates U.S. public airwaves, received a handful of complaints about the announcement, said spokesman Will Wiquist.U.S. radio stations are required to air public service announcements in the interest of community service.The commission does not impose requirements or restrictions on the announcements\' content, said commission spokeswoman Janice Wise.\"It\'s up to the station to determine their (community\'s) public interest,\" she said.The ad ran for two years before a news reporter in Tucson broke the story, KPHO reports.',real
'NEW DELHI/RAJKOT: Sonia Gandhi and Arun Jaitley on Monday clashed over the delay in convening the Winter session of Parliament with the Congress chief accusing the Modi government of sabotaging it on \"flimsy grounds\" and the Union minister saying Congress had done so too in the past.

'MANILA: With China\'s controversial military buildup likely to be a major issue at the ASEAN summit+ , Premier Li Keqiang on Sunday clearly reiterated Beijing\'s long-held position that it wants to bilaterally resolve its disputes with its neighbours over the South China Sea. In an article published in leading newspapers here, Li admitted that the bilateral relationship between China and the Philippines had \"encountered a setback\" due to the South China Sea issue+ but it was back on track due to appropriate handling of the issue by the two sides. The Chinese premier, who is in Manila for the ASEAN and East Asia summits+ , said Beijing will actively explore joint development of the South China sea to make it a \"sea of cooperation and friendship\" for the benefit of the two countries. \"China will work with the Philippines to continue to properly handle the maritime issues through friendly bilateral consultation by giving full play to such mechanisms as the Bilateral Consultation Mechanism on the South China Sea,\" Li wrote. Ahead of the annual summit of the ASEAN, an influential grouping of 10 South East Asian countries, a number of diplomats said the thorny issue of China\'s aggressive military buildup in the South China Sea+ may be one of the focus areas of the deliberations on Tuesday. China claims sovereignty over all of South China Sea, a huge source of hydrocarbons. However, several ASEAN member countries including Vietnam, the Philippines and Brunei have counter claims. India has been supporting freedom of navigation and access to resources in the South China Sea in accordance with principles of international law, including the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. The ASEAN has been pushing for a legally binding code of conduct for all stakeholders in the South China Sea but Beijing has opposed such a framework asserting it will resolve the dispute with respective countries under a bilateral mechanism. \"The two sides returned to the track of appropriately handling the South China Sea issue through dialogue and consultation, thus removing the stumbling block that has held back our bilateral relations for several years,\" Li said. The controversial issue was also understood to have figured in a meeting of officials from India, the US, Japan, and Australia under the proposed Quadrilateral coalition of the four countries. \"The discussions focused on cooperation based on their converging vision and values for promotion of peace, stability and prosperity in an increasingly inter-connected region that they share with each other and with other partners,\" the ministry of external affairs (MEA) said. \"They agreed that a free, open, prosperous and inclusive Indo-Pacific region serves the long-term interests of all countries in the region and of the world at large,\" it said.

'KANO (NIGERIA): At least 50 people were killed today when a suicide bomber blew himself up at a mosque in northeast Nigeria, police said, in an attack blamed on Boko Haram jihadists. The blast happened during early morning prayers at the Madina mosque in the Unguwar Shuwa area of Mubi, some 200 kilometres (125 miles) by road from the Adamawa state capital, Yola. \"So far we have at least 50 dead from an attack at a mosque in Mubi,\" Adamawa state police spokesman Othman Abubakar told AFP. \"Several people were injured. We don\'t have the figure now because they have been taken to several hospitals for treatment. \"It was a (suicide) bomber who mingled with worshippers. He entered the mosque along with other worshippers for the morning prayers. \"It was when the prayers were on that he set off his explosives.\" Asked who was responsible, Abubakar said: \"We all know the trend. We don\'t suspect anyone specifically but we know those behind such kind of attacks.\" The attack bore all the hallmarks of Boko Haram, the Islamist militants whose insurgency has left at least 20,000 people dead and more than 2.6 million others homeless since 2009. Haruna Furo, head of the Adamawa state emergency management agency, and Musa Hamad Bello, chairman of the Mubi north local government area, both confirmed the attack. They gave lower death tolls but both said the number of those killed was likely to rise. Another emergency services official described the blast as \"devastating\". He said only that there were \"high casualties\". Abubakar Sule, who lives near the mosque, said he had just returned home when he heard the blast. \"I was there when the rescue was on and 40 people died on the spot and several others were taken to hospital with severe and life-threatening injuries,\" he added. \"The roof was blown off. People near the mosque said the prayer was mid-way when the bomber, who was obviously in the congregation, detonated his explosives. \"This is obviously the work of Boko Haram.\" Boko Haram briefly overran Mubi in late 2014 as its fighters rampaged across northeastern Nigeria, seizing towns and villages in its quest to establish a hardline Islamic state. The town\'s name was changed temporarily to Madinatul Islam, or \"City of Islam\" in Arabic, during the Boko Haram occupation. But it has been peaceful since the military and the civilian militia ousted them from the town, which is a commercial hub and home to the Adamawa State University. In recent months, Boko Haram activity has been concentrated on the far north of Adamawa state, around Madagali, which is near the border with neighbouring Borno state. Earlier this month, at least two civilians were killed when dozens of Boko Haram fighters tried to storm the town of Gulak but were repelled by soldiers. There have been repeated suicide bombings in the area, which lies not far from the Sambisa Forest area of Borno, where the militants had a base. Boko Haram fighters are also said to be hiding in the Mandara mountains, to the east of Adamawa state, which forms the border with neighbouring Cameroon.

'UNITED NATIONS: North Korea complained to the United Nations on Monday about joint military exercises by the United State and South Korea, describing it as \"the worst ever situation\" because US nuclear war equipment had been deployed ready to strike. In a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, seen by Reuters, North Korean UN Ambassador Ja Song Nam said the United States was \"running amok for war exercises by introducing nuclear war equipment in and around the Korean Peninsula.\" Three US aircraft carrier strike groups have been involved in the joint exercise in the Western Pacific in a rare show of force as President Donald Trump visits Asia. The last time three US carrier strike groups exercised together in the Western Pacific was in 2007. South Korea has said the joint drill, due to finish on Tuesday, was in response to North Korean nuclear and missile provocations and to show any such developments by Pyongyang can be repelled with \"overwhelming force.\" However, Ja said Washington was to blame for escalating tensions and accused the UN Security Council of ignoring \"the nuclear war exercises of the United States who is hell bent on bringing catastrophic disaster to humanity.\" Ja asked Guterres to bring to the attention of the 15-member council - under the rarely used Article 99 of the UN Charter - \"the danger being posed by the US nuclear war exercises, which are clearly threats to international peace and security.\" Tensions have soared between the United States and North Korea following a series of weapons tests by Pyongyang and a string of increasingly bellicose exchanges between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Trump said in a tweet on Sunday that Kim had insulted him by calling him \"old\" and said he would never call the North Korean leader \"short and fat.\" The United States has said that all options, including military, are on the table to deal with North Korea, although its preference is for a diplomatic solution. The UN Security Council has unanimously ratcheted up sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs since 2006.

'CANBERRA: Australians have said they support gay marriage in a postal survey that ensures the Parliament considers a bill to legalise same-sex weddings this year. The Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday 62 per cent of registered adults who responded had voted for the reform in an unprecedented two-month survey. The conservative government had promised to allow the Parliament to consider a bill to create marriage equality in Australia in its final two-week session that is due to end on December 7. While gay marriage could be a reality in Australia by Christmas, some government lawmakers have vowed to vote down gay marriage regardless of the survey\'s outcome. Opponents have also questions the legitimacy of any same-sex marriage law since several lawmakers could potentially be disqualified from Parliament due to a constitutional ban on dual citizens standing for election. Ireland is the only other country in the world+ to put the divisive issue to a popular vote. In Ireland, 61 per cent of registered voters turned out for a referendum in 2015 and 62 per cent of those voted to change the constitution to allow marriage equality. In Australia, almost 80 per cent of more than 16 million registered voters posted in ballots, despite gay marriage opponents describing it as a boutique issue that did not interest most of the public. Gay rights advocates had opposed the non-binding 100 million Australian dollar ($76 million) survey as an unnecessary obstacle to achieving equality. The United Nations Human Rights Committee last week criticized Australia for putting gays and lesbians \"through an unnecessary and divisive public opinion poll.\" The committee called on Australia to legislate for marriage equality regardless of the survey\'s outcome. In 2015, then-Prime Minister Tony Abbott, a same-sex marriage opponent, committed his conservative government to holding a compulsory nationwide vote to decide whether the unions should be legal. He was replaced weeks later by current Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who supports marriage equality and opposed the public vote but eventually agreed to it in a deal with party powerbrokers. The Senate refused to fund a compulsory vote, however, so the government opted for a voluntary postal ballot. Critics said it was unlikely to accurately reflect public opinion. Abbott was head-butted by a gay rights advocate during the campaign in September. Kevin Rudd, a center-left Labor Party prime minister whom Abbott defeated in elections in 2013, blamed the postal ballot for an assault on his godson Sean Foster, 19, as he campaigned for marriage equality Australian lawmakers are already moving to wind back anti-discrimination laws to reduce barriers for people who would boycott gay weddings. Debate is intensifying on whether Australians who would refuse to provide gay weddings with a celebrant, venue, flowers or a cake should have added protection against anti-discrimination laws. Several government lawmakers on Monday released a draft gay marriage bill that critics argue would diminish current protections for gays against discrimination on the grounds of sexuality. Turnbull on Tuesday ruled out downgrading anti-discrimination laws. Get latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.',real
'Last Updated Sep 22, 2017 12:41 AM EDTWEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. -- A woman screaming about Cuba pointed a gun Thursday at employees inside the Kardashian-owned DASH boutique in West Hollywood and returned hours later waving a machete at reporters, but eluded authorities both times.The woman first walked into the shop during the late morning and shouted, \"stay away from Cuba,\" Los Angeles County sheriff\'s officials said.She knocked several items off a counter before leaving on foot.About two hours later, she returned with a machete and swung it at reporters and photographers who had gathered outside the boutique before sticking it through a slot in the front door, authorities said.According to CBS Los Angeles, one of their photographers was taping when the woman returned a short time later, this time armed with a machete and apparently threatening camera crews and reporters at the scene.The woman is heard in a news video saying, \"The Kardashians will be executed if they step on communist territory.\"The photographer posted a picture of the machete and posted it to Twitter:The unidentified woman -- seen wearing a bandana and dressed in a sweater emblazoned with several skulls -- was recorded as she screamed, \"Don\'t mess with the Castro family.\"Investigators were reviewing security video, according to Sheriff\'s Sgt.

'CASTRO VALLEY, Calif. -- A Northern California woman who has been breeding hundreds of exotic birds in her backyard has received an ultimatum: get rid of most of them or face the consequences.CBS San Francisco reports that authorities searched the exotic bird farm at Bianca Pham\'s home in Castro Valley on Tuesday.A team of code enforcement officials and animal control officers cited Pham when they found at least 500 birds on the property.Authorities say Pham has been cooperative in the past few weeks. She\'s reduced her flock of parrots, macaws and other exotic birds to 250. She now has one month to bring that number down to just 50 -- the maximum number of birds allowed in the rural area.But neighbors say they are upset over the sounds, smells and flies.\"Hopefully, as we go forward in the next 30 days, that will be down to 50,\" Alameda County Sheriff\'s Department spokesman Sgt.

They said we will continue to get the same funding as we’re getting now. Colleges will get autonomy to start their own courses, formulate their own syllabus and hold their own examinations. The results will be declared by the university. Also, on the degree, the name of the college will be mentioned although it will be given by the university,” said S K Garg, Principal of Deen Dayal Upadhyaya College.Garg said colleges with ‘A’ grade given by NAAC (National Assessment and Accreditation Council) could apply for autonomous status. However, other principals said there was much “confusion” about its implementation and that authorities were not able to adequately answer the questions posed by principals.“They said colleges which have one stream will get Rs 9 lakh as funding annually, those who have two-three streams would get somewhere around Rs 15 lakh. The money isn’t enough… On the one hand they say colleges will get autonomy to frame their own syllabus, but on the other hand they have also implemented CBCS (Choice-Based Credit System) which gives a uniform syllabus for all colleges,” a DU principal told The Indian Express.',real

'LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh Shia Waqf Board on Monday proposed relinquishing its right over the disputed land in Ayodhya, and building a \'masjid-e-aman\" in Lucknow to resolve the Ram janmabhoomi-Babri masjid tangle, a move rejected by the Muslim protagonists involved in the protracted legal fued. The board, which is the \'mutawalli\' (caretaker) of the Babri Mosque, has proposed giving up its right over the land in Ayodhya, and a draft for resolving the issue, prepared by the Shia Waqf Board, has been submitted in the Supreme Court on November 18, its chairman Wasim Rizvi told reporters here. Claiming that the formula for resolving the matter proposed by the Shia Waqf Board was the best, Rizvi said it is of the view that instead of Ayodhya, a \'masjid-e-aman\' (the mosque of peace) be constructed in Lucknow\'s Hussainabad area. The Board, he said, has requested the government to provide a one acre plot for it. The proposal, however, did not go down well with the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB). \"On whose behalf has he brought this draft proposal? He (Rizvi) does not enjoy the confidence or recognition of either the Sunni sect or the Shia sect,\" AIMPLB counsel in the case and its senior member Zafaryab Jilani said. Jilani, who is also the convenor of Babri Masjid Action committee, referred to some legal shortcomings in the draft proposal. \"The Shia Board has no authority over the disputed land as the Allahabad High Court, in 2010, had ruled a three-way division of the disputed 2.77-acre area at Ayodhya among Sunni Waqf Board, Nirmohi Akhara and Lord Ram Lalla ... the Shia board has no right over any part of the land,\" he said. Moreover, Jilani said since the Shia Waqf Board did not appeal against the high court\'s decision, it meant that the ruling, which was binding on all till the Supreme Court announced its judgement, was acceptable to them. Rizvi, however, rejected the claim of UP Sunni Central Waqf Board over the disputed site, saying that the Allahabd High court had given the land to Muslims and not to Sunni Waqf Board. Chairman of the UP Sunni Central Waqf Board Zafar Farooqui said any claim can be accepted or rejected only by the court \"... our involvement has been since 1961 and it is being rejected by the Shia Board now...he (Rizvi) does not have the authority to do so...\" Rizvi, he said, has been chairman of the board since 2006-07, and could have spoken on the subject even when the case was being heard by the Lucknow bench, which came up with its verdict in 2010, or in the Supreme Court where the hearing is going on for the last seven years. \"It is absurd. He has been silent on it ever since and has become active only now. The case is going on in the highest court of the country. Whatever he has to say, he should do it in the court. What\'s the relevance of releasing his formula to the media?\" he said. Jilani alleged that Rizvi was \"working overtime to please certain forces in order to serve his personal motives\". Rizvi, who addressed the press conference along with Mahant Narendra Giri, chairman of the All India Akhara Parishad, alleged that the Shia Board\'s views on the matter were never put forward in a forceful manner because the lawyers deployed for the purpose were \"fake\". Referring to the criticism of his recent actions, Rizvi said it was because the board was never given any court copy and that it was not aware that lawyers were pleading on its behalf. It was only on March 21, 2017, when the apex court said that talks could be initiated for mutual agreement to end the dispute that the Shia Waqf Board looked into the files in detail only to find that though it is a party in the case it never gave \'wakalatnama\' to the counsel appearing on its behalf, Rizvi said. \"It is a matter of probe that the case is being pursued by overlooking the actual claimant which is the Shia Board...I have requested the central and state governments to get it enquired as to who had fielded the lawyers on our behalf,\" he said. On Rizvi\'s allegations regarding fake counsel, Jilani said that it should be probed by the Shia board itself. Jilani, however, said that he had never seen any counsel pleading on behalf of the Shia Board in the court. On the role of AIMPLB, Rizvi said it (board) should have come forward for a dialogue but since it did not take the initiative, Shia board had to come forward. Giri said a Ram temple in Ayodhya will be constructed and that an amicable settlement should be reached on the issue by talking to all the parties concerned.

'NEW YORK -- A professional ballet dancer in New York City is being hailed as a hero after he jumped into action to rescue a man who was pushed onto the subway tracks over the weekend, CBS New York reports.As a dancer with the American Ballet Theater, 31-year-old Grey Davis is paid to perform amazing leaps and lifts. This week, he\'s being lauded for a lift of a different kind.It happened Saturday night when Davis, his mother, and his wife -- who is also a ballet dancer -- were at the 72nd Street train station heading home. While waiting for their train, they saw a man and a woman arguing loudly across the platform.\"It wasn\'t scary at first but my wife said this looks like it\'s going to escalate pretty quickly,\" Davis told CBS New York. \"She started hitting him and once the hitting and punching started that\'s when I knew something was going to happen.\"When the alteration between the man and woman became violent, Davis says he ran upstairs to get help but he couldn\'t find anyone. He raced over to where the two were but when get got there, the woman was gone and the man was unconscious on the tracks.\"I saw nobody else was going down there,\" Davis said. \"People were screaming for somebody to go get help and there was a good bit of people there and I saw him laying there and he wasn\'t getting up and I heard a train coming but I didn\'t know which direction it was coming from.\"Davis picked the man up with no thoughts of his own well-being. Davis recently suffered a herniated disc and hadn\'t danced in a month, but his first pas de deux partner wasn\'t a lithe ballerina, it was a man he estimates weighs about 250 pounds.\"I rolled him over my shoulder and I didn\'t realize how high the platform was until I went to put him up there,\" Davis said. \"Two other people helped me get him the rest of the way up there and then somebody grabbed me and pulled me the rest of the way too.\"Other witnesses detained a 23-year-old woman who ran from the scene. Police took her into custody within minutes.People at the train station where it all happened are calling Davis a hero.\"That\'s selflessness, that\'s complete heroism, and I would like to believe that everyone would step up in a situation like that and help out a stranger,\" Manhattan resident Kasia Reterska said.\"He\'s strong, I\'m pretty sure it\'s all about the ballet dancing,\" Bronx resident Jean Perez said. \"There\'s a lot of lifting going on and I think he\'s a hero.\"Davis said he was a bit sore Monday, but his ballet training helped him because he was taught to lift with his legs. He was applauded by strap-hangers right after the incident, and at rehearsal Monday morning he was applauded by his fellow dancers.He\'ll be sure to hear more applause Monday night when he returns to the stage to perform the ballet \"Le Corsaire\" at Lincoln Center.\"We\'re all human beings and anytime you have the chance to help somebody, please take that,\" Davis said.The stranger Davis saved is expected to make a full recovery. The woman accused of pushing him onto the tracks is facing assault charges.',real
'BEIJING: India\'s new ambassador to China Gautam Bambawale arrived here on Sunday to take up his position. Bambawale, a seasoned diplomat who till recently served as high commissioner to Pakistan and earlier as envoy to Bhutan, will take charge tomorrow. A 1984-batch Indian Foreign Service (IFS) officer, Bambawale succeeded Vijay Gokhale who took over as Secretary (Economic Relations) at the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA). A deft hand on Sino-India relations, Bambawale earlier handled the China desk at the MEA which also included relations with Japan, China, South Korea, Mongolia and North Korea. A Mandarin speaker, he has also served as the deputy chief of mission of the Indian Embassy in Beijing earlier. His arrival here comes at a time when India and China are trying to put behind the Dokalam standoff and work on a \"forward-looking\" approach in their ties. For the first time after the 73-day standoff, the two countries held their border consultation and coordination mechanism meeting here two days ago during which they reviewed the situation in all sectors of their border and exchanged views on confidence-building measures and military contacts. The 10th round of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China Border Affairs (WMCC) was held in Beijing on November 17. The India-China border dispute covers the 3488-km Line of Actual Control (LAC). While China claims Arunachal Pradesh as Southern Tibet, India asserts that the dispute covers Aksai Chin area which was occupied by China during the 1962 war. Bambawale is taking charge ahead of plans by both countries to begin a high-level dialogue next month, which will be the first after the Dokalam standoff as well as the commencement of the second five-year term of President Xi Jinping. Xi began his second term in office following the endorsement by the once-in-five-years Congress of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) here last month. Officials say Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi will travel to New Delhi in the second week of next month to take part in the Russia-India-China (RIC) dialogue mechanism during which he was also expected to hold talks his Indian counterpart Sushma Swaraj and meet the top Indian leadership. It will be followed by the 20th round of India-China border talks headed by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and his Chinese counterpart Yang Jiechi also to be held in New Delhi. Both Doval and Yang are designated as special representatives who are also mandated to discuss all issues related to India-China relations.

'WASHINGTON: The talks between governments of Bangladesh and Myanmar should lead to voluntary return of Rohingya Muslims back to the Rakhine State, a senior US diplomat has said. The diplomat had recently led a high-level US delegation to Myanmar and Bangladesh, where he visited refugees camps and met officials. He had described the situation on the ground as \"serious\" and the scale of problem as \"immense\". US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is scheduled to visit Myanmar early next week to hold talks with both the civilian and military officials. Since August, more than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have landed in neighbouring Bangladesh due to alleged atrocities by the security forces in Myanmar\'s Rakhine State. Bangladesh, one of the poorest countries of the world, has gone out of the way to provide shelter and humanitarian assistance to these Rohingya refugees. A move which was appreciated by the governments and the humanitarian and relief organisations from across the world. Given the strain that the refugees crisis has been putting on its economy, the Bangladesh government has been in talks with the government of Myanmar for the return of the refugees. \"I am not going to comment on the relations between the two countries other than to say that we support their talks and they have already held and further talks on solving the Rohingya issue,\" Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees, and Migration Simon Henshaw told reporters during a teleconference with South Asian media this week. \"We believe these talks should lead to voluntary return of Rohingya people back to Rakhine state. The conditions in Rakhine state must be made secure and stable so that people are willing to return and that people should be able to return to their land and that this process involve political reconciliation inside Rakhine State,\" he said. \"On the actions of the Bangladeshi government, we much appreciate them and praise the effort they\'ve made to deal with this huge number of people coming into their country,\" he said, adding that the American delegation spoke with a number of different ministries when they were there. In Myanmar, the delegation met with government officials, Rohingya and ethnic Rakhine community leaders including a visit to a camp for people who have been internally displaced. \"We urge the Myanmar government to act to restore the rule of law, protect local populations and investigate alleged human rights abuses and violations and to hold those responsible, accountable,\" he said. The official welcomed the government\'s plans for repatriation and encouraged them to implement a peace plan soon as possible emphasising the importance of creating safe conditions that would allow refugees to voluntarily return to their villages. The US delegation, during its visit to Bangladesh, had met with government officials, international organisation and NGOSs and visited refugee camps near Coxes Bazaar, which he said was so shocking. \"The scale of the refugee crisis is immense. More than 600,000 people displaced from their homes since August 25th and the conditions here conditions are tough with people still in makeshift tents and shelters as far as the eye can see,\" he said. \"People were suffering. Many refugees told us through tears accounts of seeing their villages burned their relatives kill in front of them. Some of them recalled being shot at as they fled. Despite this trauma many expressed a strong desire to return to their homes in Burma provided that their safety security and rights could be guaranteed,\" Henshaw said.

'IT HAS been a year since the Bhangar land agitation started, sparking violence in South 24 Parganas over the state government’s attempt to construct a power sub-station. The protesters, who have been trying to organise themselves politically since then, are now mulling contesting the next year’s panchayat elections.Over the last few months, 11 village committees have been set up in Polerhat II gram panchayat area, where Bhangar is located. Following this, on October 29, thousands of villagers had attended a sammelan and set up umbrella committee JJPBRC — Jami, Jibika, Poribesh O Bastutantra Raksha Committee (Committee to secure Land, Livelihood, Environment and Ecosystem). The committee, primarily comprising villagers, will approve any development project to be taken up in the area. JJPBRC convener and spokesperson, Mirza Hassan, said: “We are looking at all possibilities, including fighting the panchayat elections. It depends on whether the state government agrees to all our demands. But we are looking at fighting the elections.”JJPBRC, as well as the 11 village committees, will hold several meetings over the coming months to take a final call, he added.“A number of Opposition leaders have come and supported us. CPM MLA Sujan Chakraborty, for instance, attended the sammelan and lent his and his party’s support to us,” said Hassan.\r\nFrom October 15 to October 27, 16 villages had held a series of meetings to set up 11 committees. Each committee, with between 40 and 125 members, will look after the general affairs of the villages. “The committees will access and approve development projects, which the panchayat or the government may take up. These will also monitor progress of government schemes and probe corruption. Basically, any decision to do with the village, however minor, will be taken by the concerned village committee,” said Hasan.Incidentally, little-known Naxal group CPI(ML) Red Star, under the name Jami, Jibika, Poribesh O Bastutantra Raksha Committee, had spearheaded the Bhangar agitation last year.CPM insiders said JJPBRC was set up following the party’s traditional model — several village committees coming together to set up a larger umbrella committee.Experts said what is more significant is that the nature of activities that have taken place in Bhangar over the past few months mirrors the Singur and Nandigram land movements, which had catapulted Trinamool Congress to power in 2011.In Singur, the agitation was carried out under the banner of Singur Krishi Jami Raksha Committee. In Nadigram, it was Bhoomi Ucched Pratibadh Committee and later in Lalgarh, People’s Committee against Police Atrocities. In all three cases, the umbrella committees had dozens of village committees working under them, mobilising booth level voters and ensuring the toppling of the Left Front government.In Bhangar, while villagers are keen on contesting as independent candidates, they seem to have the full backing of both the Congress and CPM. Besides Sujan Chakraborty, leader of Opposition Abdul Mannan, Congress president Adhir Chowdhury, CPM state secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra and Left chairman Biman Basu have visited the area over the last few months. So have rights activist Binayak Sen, politician Yogendra Yadav and CPM’s peasant leaders Hannan Mollah and Biju Krishnan.\r\nThis is in stark contrast from the time Opposition leaders were not allowed into Bhangar by the government. But committee members maintained that their resistance has been so strong that not only have they been able to hold meetings, but now Trinamool leaders are being forced to stay away.When the Bhangar agitation was at its peak, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had announced that no move would be made to construct the power grid without the permission of the villagers. She has subsequently dropped UAPA charges against many protesters. A key leader of the movement, Alik Chakraborty, is now out of prison while still facing charges under UAPA.',real

'DARJEELING: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha central committee on Monday suspended party president Bimal Gurung for six months, a day ahead of an all-party meeting called by chief minister Mamata Banerjee. Gurung\'s wife and GJM Mahila Morcha chief Asha, his close aide and party general secretary Roshan Giri and seven others were also suspended for the same period, Binay Tamang, who was appointed the party\'s new president, said. Anit Thapa was made general secretary and other vacant posts in the party would be filled soon, Tamang said at a press conference after the meeting held at Ghoom near here. Tomorrow\'s all-party meeting has been called by the chief minister to discuss the current situation in the hills. Gurung has been on the run since August after the state government lodged cases against him under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for his alleged involvement in bomb blasts in Darjeeling hills during the over three-month-long shutdown for a separate state. The 104-day shutdown was called off on September 27. While a faction of the GJM supports Gurung, the one being backed by the state government is led by Tamang. Tamang himself was expelled from the party in a central committee meeting headed by Gurung at an undisclosed location in September. Later that month, the state government formed a nine- member \'Board of Administrators\' to run the Gorkha Territorial Administration (GTA) and appointed Tamang as its chairman. All 45 elected members of GTA including its chief executive Bimal Gurung had resigned in June when the agitation had begun.

The government\'s response came days after the apex court in October asked it to set up a panel of experts to block life-threatening online games. The plea was filed by a Delhi based activist and advocate Sneha Kalita. The \'Blue Whale Challenge\' was termed a \'suicide game\'.

'A New Jersey mom says she posted her 3-year-old son\'s heart surgery bill online to show how potential changes in the health care law could drastically increase out-of-pocket costs for those with life-threatening conditions.Ali Chandra\'s son, Ethan, was born with a congenital heart defect known as heterotaxy. He\'s already had multiple surgeries which have been covered by health insurance. Chandra is concerned that the existing ban on lifetime benefits caps — meaning insurers can stop paying expenses once medical bills reach a specified limit — may be eliminated as part of the ongoing health care law overhaul. \"A lifetime cap on benefits is the same as saying, \'Sorry, you\'re not worth keeping alive anymore. You\'re just too expensive,\" she wrote in a Twitter post on Friday. Many on Twitter responded empathetically to her post.Chandra, a married registered nurse who also has a young daughter, recently posted the bill for Ethan\'s most recent open heart surgery. The family\'s share was $500, but she said it would have cost them $231,115 if they didn\'t have insurance.Chandra wrote that her son has undergone four heart surgeries overall and will need more going forward.

'Last Updated Jul 21, 2017 1:06 AM EDTResearchers have their hands on a rare fossil from the Pleistocene era thanks to a 10-year-old\'s clumsiness.Jude Sparks said he literally fell on the 1.2-million-year-old skull of a stegomastodon -- a massive prehistoric creature with tusks like an elephant -- while on a hike with his parents on the desert outskirts of his neighborhood in Las Cruces, New Mexico.\"I was running farther up and I tripped on part of the tusk,\" Sparks said in a statement from New Mexico State University, where researchers are studying the find. \"My face landed next to the bottom jaw. I looked farther up and there was another tusk.\"The stegomastodon is one of three species of proboscideans that inhabited the ancient Rio Grande Valley, and is believed to be an ancestor to modern-day elephants.Sparks\' parents contacted biologist Peter Houde, a professor at New Mexico State University, after hearing he had discovered a similar fossil in a quarry south of campus, the university said.The fossil was found on private land, and it took several months to get permission to excavate from the property owner. In New Mexico, the law stipulates that vertebrate fossils found on private land belong to the landowner. Here, the property owner asked that the precise site remain confidential, according to the university.The Sparks family eventually joined with Houde and his students to excavate the skull, a process that took one week.The large skull is deceptively delicate, and the only thing holding it together was the sediment around it, Houde said.\"When the sediments are removed from the sides of [the bones], they start to fall apart immediately and literally fall into tiny, tiny bits. It has to be done carefully by somebody who knows how to go about doing it. It is a very deliberate process that takes a little bit of time,\" he said.The team applied chemical hardeners to the fossil, mimicking the bone strength provided by protein, to keep it intact. Once dug from the ground, the fossil was coated in plaster and supported by wood braces for transport to New Mexico State University\'s Vertebrate Museum, where it now lives.\"We have the unique opportunity to really compare what the animal looks like [on] a much larger complete scale and compare it with others,\" Houde told CBS Albuquerque affiliate KRQE, adding that it\'s extremely rare to find a nearly intact skull of a mammal dating back to the Ice Age.The process to reconstruct the skull, jaw and tusks is likely to take years to complete, Houde said.\"I have every hope and expectation that this specimen will ultimately end up on exhibit and this little boy will be able to show his friends and even his own children, look what I found right here in Las Cruces,\" he said.',real
'Who can forget the iconic scene from the 1961 blockbuster ‘Breakfast at Tiffany’s’ when Audrey Hepburn snacks on a pastry while gazing into a Tiffany & Co. shop window on Fifth Avenue? With the luxury jewellery brand launching an eatery at the same Manhattan flagship store, this scene from the film has suddenly taken a brand new meaning.Named the Blue Box Café, it’s inspired by the much-loved Robin egg blue packaging that Holly Golightly talked about in the movie.

'NEW DELHI: BSF has stepped up vigil along the Pakistan border after foiling a bid by drug smugglers to push in a consignment of heroin. In an operation which is being talked about in the security circles for successful collaboration among security forces, BSF worked with the Counter Intelligence wing of Punjab Police to thwart the armed narco smugglers who were bringing in the contraband in the Ferozpur sector. The seizure included 22kg of heroine, one 9 mm pistol of Turkish-make and several rounds of ammunition from a spot which was found marked with blood stains, an indication that the Pakistan-based smugglers suffered injuries after the alert posse of BSF troopers fired upon them. BSF views the incident as serious as the smugglers, undeterred by the approaching BSF personnel, had persisted with their aggressive postures, a pointer that the smuggler network across the border may try to take advantage of smog and fog to send drugs across. The BSF chief reviewed the situation with additional director general (western command) Kamal Nayan Chaubey and other senior officers. But there is also satisfaction over the successful conduct of the operation. It was a specific intelligence tip-off which led BSF to close in on the infiltration point. Smuggling of drugs has over the years emerged as a security challenge: a threat which, while responsible for rampant addiction, has spawned a network of criminals working in tandem with smugglers across the border. In 2017, BSF intercepted nearly 200kg of heroin and two thousand kg of opium.

'TWO DAYS after spiritual guru Sri Sri Ravi Shankar said that Muslims “by and large” are not opposed to construction of Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya, a member of All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) on Friday said that dialogue is not possible “if they already have an agenda to build a temple”.Addressing a media conference organised by Anujman-e-Haideri, a society of Dargah Shah-e-Mardan in Delhi’s Jor Bagh. AIMPLB’s Mufti Aijaz Arshad Quasmi said, “We should also get our right — the masjid needs to be built. We have no problem if they want to construct a temple nearby.”Claiming that Ravi Shankar has changed his stance since their first meeting in Bengaluru on October 6, Quasmi said, “We had met in the presence of leaders from different religions. In it, Sri Sri had said ‘no community should feel disturbed or hurt’. Now he is talking about just mandir.”Maulana Mohammad Qasim, Shahi Imam of Dargah Shah-e-Mardan, said all Muslims are united in their demand for building the Babri Masjid. Syed Bahadur Abbas Naqvi, general secretary of Anjuman-e-Haideri, said, “In 1992, Supreme Court put a stay on demolition, but still it was done (demolished). In due respect to law and court, the masjid should be made first, and then a status quo order drawn.”It was announced at the press meet that 5 lakh members from the Muslim community will gather in Delhi November 26 to pass a resolution on this. The Waqf Protection Movement will also be launched that day, the leaders said. The group demanded that Ravi Shankar put the road map for finding a solution to the Babri dispute in public.',real
'NEW YORK -- In a scene that you definitely don\'t see every day, a bull got loose Tuesday in Brooklyn, CBS New York reports, attracting a lot of attention in Prospect Park and on social media -- and also leaving a child with minor injuries.The bull got loose shortly before 12 p.m. local time from a slaughterhouse, authorities said.The bull mooed and ran rambunctiously down city streets and ended up two miles away at the parade ground in Prospect Park, CBS New York writes. Spectators flocked around in hopes of getting a glimpse of the farm animal in their urban backyard.\"My friend texted me like: \'You have to go down the street. Like on the news, there\'s a cow outside, and I was like, \'Are you serious?\'\" said Zara Ahmad. \"So I ran out here, and all these people, and this is hilarious and amazing.\"\"Literally, the first time ever. I\'ve never experienced anything like this,\" said Randi Arias. \"This is a total culture shock right now.\"\"I\'ve been living here almost 40 years, never seen one. Raccoons, yes; cows, no,\" one resident said.But it wasn\'t so funny for everyone. The bull wandered wildly through city streets for hours, and even rammed into a mother and child who were walking on Parkside Avenue. Witnesses said the 1-year-old was knocked over and got a black eye.\"The mom was just crying. The baby was screaming in pain,\" said witness Alexis Small. \"It was scary, and I had my son with me too.\"The toddler was expected to recover after being rushed to a local medical center with minor injuries.Meanwhile, the bull continued on its way, eventually ending up at an athletic field a few blocks away.Several NYPD units attempted to corner the bull while controlling the crowd. As police approached the animal with a tranquilizer gun, one man begged them to let him use the skills he learned growing up on a farm.\"We can\'t, we\'re liable now. If he\'s your bull, you can catch him,\" an officer said.\"That\'s crazy,\" he replied.\"When a farm animal, like the bull found today in Prospect Park, is found loose in New York City, what you are witnessing is an individual who was so determined to live that they summoned every ounce of courage they could muster to make a dash for freedom,\" Farm Sanctuary, America\'s leading farm animal protection organization, said in a statement.Police eventually corralled the bull in a baseball dugout at around 1:20 p.m, sealing the exits with police trucks, WCBS-AM reports. The bull tried to leap over the hood of one of the trucks before an officer got a rope around its neck and lead it up a ramp into a horse trailer.\"I was just hoping they were more gentle with the cow than sometimes they are with people,\" one man said.\"It was a valiant effort,\" said a woman.Residents hope the animal gets a second chance to live a long life.\"I think that\'s one lucky cow, because he was in the meat market,\" another woman said. \"He was about to meet his demise, and here he is now.\"The bull, nicknamed Jimmy K, was taken to the Skylands Animals Sanctuary in East New York, Brooklyn.',real
'TULARE COUNTY -- A father and his two young children were struck by lightning in Tulare County and lived to tell about it.

'SUNNYVALE, Calif. -- Even in the real estate craziness of Silicon Valley, the sale of a modest four-bedroom home in a quiet California neighborhood has stirred up quite a buzz.CBS San Francisco reports it\'s not unusual for bidding wars to erupt over homes in the Bay Area. Over-asking offers are more the norm than the exception. But what happened at one home in Sunnyvale has raised the anxiety of many home buyers.The home was listed for $1,688,000. After seven days, the home sold for $2,470,000. Bidding on the property had become quite heated as 20 different buyers put in offers.\"There were lots of people who gave very good, high prices\" for the property, Keller Williams agent Dave Clark -- who represented the sellers in the deal -- told the San Jose Mercury News.\"I think it\'s the most anything has ever gone for over asking in Sunnyvale, a record for Sunnyvale,\" Clark told the paper. \"We anticipated it would go for $2 million, or over $2 million. But we had no idea it would ever go for what it went for.\"The price also was likely impacted by the home\'s location. It\'s just a mile from Apple\'s new headquarters building.The buyers, while not identified by name, are tech workers who had lost bidding wars for other homes.Industry sources told the Mercury News that the property was one of more than 50 South Bay homes that sold in the last month for at least $200,000 above the listing price.The Sun Mercury points out the residence is about 3.5 miles from Apple\'s new spaceship campus -- where techies galore descended to see the company unveil its new lineup of products including the iPhone X.',real
'The debit and credit card transactions have jumped to Rs 74,090 crore in September this year, up a hefty 84 per cent as compared to the same month last year when it stood at Rs 40,130 crore, thanks to the government push for non-cash payments, says a study. The transaction volume at all points of sale (POSes) clipped higher by 86 per cent to 378 million in September this year over the same period last year when it stood at 203 million, European payment solutions provider Worldline said in a weekend report quoting the Reserve Bank data.In September 2016 the number stood at 203 million, it added.“With demonetisation, people were pushed to use non-cash modes of payment for everyday expenses. Even after the cash is back to the pre-demonetisation levels, there is a visible growth in card transactions,” Deepak Chandnani, chief executive of Worldline South Asia & Middle East, told PTI.The push to increase cards usage started with the Prime Minister Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) in August 2014, the survey said.Total number of cards as of September 2017 stood at 853 million. Of this, 33.3 million were credit cards and 819.8 million were debit cards.There was a marked spurt, especially for debit cards, which shot by 39 per cent in 2015 because of the new Jan Dhan accounts. Post-demonetisation, growth has been averaging at 22 per cent, the survey added.The growth of credit cards from 2016 to 2017 has been 24 per cent, higher than the average growth but consistent with the trend of the past few years, the study said.Between 2011 and 2016, credit cards have seen a steady 9 per cent increase.The study further said digital payment companies have seen a substantial jump in business following the government’s push towards cashless transactions after the note-ban last November, and the major contributor to this growth was online payments.According to RBI, after the note-ban, digital transactions rose 31 per cent from last November to this September.Growth rate of the digital payments industry, which was earlier in the range of 20-50 per cent, has accelerated post-demonetisation to over 40 per cent.As of September, the number of transactions on the unified payments interface (UPI) jumped 85 per cent in a month. The rise in UPI adoption is also facilitated by the rise in smartphone users and increased availability of 3G and 4G data (89 per cent of total mobile data), the survey said.',real
'Suggesting test-takers how to tackle an exam is always a tricky business and when it comes to CAT it’s an even more formidable task. Before getting into the analysis of errors to avoid during CAT 2017 based on relevant data it is imperative to understand the objective of aptitude and ability tests. These tests are designed to assess one’s logical reasoning or thinking performance.CAT is strictly timed and as a typical exam, it tests one’s ability to perform under pressure, observation skills and decision-making.First thing first: As soon as the test starts one should leaf through the entire question paper and divide it into easy, moderate and difficult categories of questions. After this jump to the easiest question in which one is very comfortable. This will not merely fetch marks for those particular questions rather it will help in boosting the confidence for the entire test. Read | CAT 2017: Toppers share last weeks’ preparation tips, click hereBias: It has been observed that students go for the questions for a particular chapter based on his or her special liking for the area. The interesting part is that sometimes these questions are deliberately asked only to trap students, they spend a lot of time on this and mostly come out exhausted and short of time. After analysing the way how test takers devote time on different question, it evinces that so many easy questions remain untouched even though they are extremely easy. Contrary to common belief that they are from so-called difficult chapter!Easy to solve easy to comprehend: One more interesting fact comes out from our analysis is that student go by the length of the question and jugglery of the language. For example, if length of the question is very short it will get priority over so called lengthy question and same applies for language of the question. One shouldn’t have stuck if the language of the question is not very lucid what happens actually is these questions can be solved merely by the data given in between lines. So one shouldn’t keep niggling on the words of the question or other language jugglery.Never pre-fix a target especially in terms of number of questions: \r\nTry to segregate the doable questions as per your strength and weakness. Try to attempt as many questions after shortlisting the questions to optimise speed and accuracy. One should not forget that there is no any co-relation between percentage and percentile scores.Accuracy dips at last minutes: After analysing the order in which question is attempted and corresponding probability of its correctness it evince that first few questions are having higher probability of correctness. As everything remains same it comes to a student’s psychology. What happens is he or she loses concentration when the test draws towards end.Do not lose hope after the first section. You may outperform all others in the remaining two. At the same time, do not carry the failure of the previous question/section. Neither be too excited nor too dejected. Remain focused for a clinical performance.',real

'BANGUI (Central African Republic): Four people were killed and over 20 wounded when grenades were thrown into a concert in the capital of the chronically unstable Central African Republic, while revenge attacks later left another three people dead, the UN peacekeeping force and a local official said on Sunday. In the first serious incident of violence in Bangui this year, the assault late yesterday saw two unidentified attackers hurl grenades at a cafe called \"On the Crossroads of Peace\" during a performance, said Herve Verhoosel, spokesman for the UN peacekeeping force MINUSCA. CAR\'s minister for public security, Henri Wanzet, told state radio that four people had died in the attack and around 20 were injured. An official probe has been opened, Wanzet said. The cafe is located near the PK5 majority Muslim district of Bangui, once a Muslim rebel bastion, and now home to several armed groups. Even though relative peace has been restored in Central Africa following the civil war that erupted in 2013, inter- communal tensions remain. Among those injured in Saturday\'s attack were several musicians from the group that was performing, Verhoosel said. A doctor at the hospital where the injured were rushed for treatment said 21 people had been admitted. Seven others were taken to another health centre, a local official with Doctors Without Borders (MSF) medical charity said. A local public figure said three people were killed later in the night in revenge attacks -- two of whom had their throats cut and one who was beaten to death. \"They were two motorcycle-taxi drivers and a young man who was walking in the neighbourhood,\" the man, who asked not to be identified, told AFP. \"They are innocents\". He appealed for calm in the neighbourhood where sporadic gunfire could be heard and armed members of \"self-defence\" groups patrolled. An armoured car carrying MINUSCA troops was stationed at the entrance to PK5. An AFP correspondent saw three bodies taken to the morgue from a local mosque. A witness who did not give his name said the attackers at the cafe had launched four grenades. In a video posted on his Facebook page, the concert\'s singer Ozaguin -- dubbed the king of Central African rumba -- confirmed six of his fellow musicians had been injured. He said he was surprised that he was not himself injured by grenade fragments.

'NEW DELHI: Have a wait listed ticket for your next trip during holidays? Not to worry, you might just be able to make it on a confirmed ticket. A study by a popular travel portal has said that while the cancellation of wait list tickets was as high as 25.5 per cent during the Diwali of 2015 because of non-confirmation, the number has been stable at 18 per cent in 2016 and 2017. This in effect means that more wait listed passengers have been able to travel with confirmed tickets than before. A study by RailYatri, an online travel community that has 10 million monthly active users, said that for the Dehradun- Howrah Doon Express, the confirmation rate increased by over 20 per cent during the period, for Mumbai CST-Howrah Superfast Mail (Via Gaya) increased by 11 per cent, Pune-Jammu Tawi Jhelum Express by over 12 per cent and Bangalore-Danapur Sanghamitra Superfast Express by more than five per cent. Even the the average waiting list has gone down considerably from last year. For example, the wait list of the Kota-Patna Express has come down to 735 from 813, while of Ahmedabad-Haridwar Yoga Express has decreased from 731 to 717. Similarly, the waiting list of the Mumbai-Darbhanga Pawan Express has come down from 800 to 769. \"Every year during Diwali, there is a huge demand for train tickets and many end up with wait listed tickets and uncertain travel plans. However, this year it is heartening to see that fewer people had to cancel their tickets. It is definitely a good trend,\" said Manish Rathi, Co-founder and CEO RailYatri. Both, officials of the rail ministry as well as Rathi, credit the trend to addition of new trains and extra coaches which have helped accommodate the rush of passengers. \"The Diwali rush this year was nicely managed by adding special trains at the right time and on the right route,\" said Rathi. During 2015-2017, railways has introduced 152 new trains, and special trains have made as many as 64,840 trips during the holiday season. This means that the number of seats available for passengers has also increased.

'The Union Ministry of Finance has turned down the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation’s revised budget demand for Rs 925 crore by pointing out that the urban local body should generate its own revenue rather than asking for additional funds.The move will affect many development projects of the city which were approved by the general house. Estimates were ready as the MC is already going into deep financial crisis. A senior officer of the UT Administration said, “We have conveyed the ministry decision to the MC Commissioner.”The financial position of the MC is so bad that they have been using fixed deposits to pay salaries. Every year, MC has to pay Rs 360 crore as salaries while the revenue from its own sources is just Rs 150 crore. The fixed deposits, which amounted to Rs 500 crore six years ago, have come down to around Rs 180 crore now.In February this year, in its budget meet, the MC had approved the budget of Rs 1,005 crore. Chief Accounts Officer Uma Shankar Sharma said that they had been given only Rs 269 crore, an amount which is not even sufficient to pay salaries, what to talk of development works. Following this, they asked for a revised budget of Rs 925 crore.Municipal Commissioner Jitender Yadav told Chandigarh Newsline the projected budget amount included the revenue and capital budget. “We have been getting less grants in the last five years. They are almost frozen. Salaries have to be paid. Fixed deposits have reduced,” he said.The estimate of road recarpeting in the city has been prepared for around Rs 35 crore while that of footpaths with PCC tiles has already been approved for Rs 20 crore.Construction work of several new community centres and renovation of existing ones for about Rs 20 crore is already on while a grid sub-station of 66KV had to be set up again for Rs 20 crore. The MC had identified dark spots in city green belts and streets where they have to carry out the street lighting work of Rs 20 crore. Estimates of open gyms in green belts and the maintenance is for about Rs 10 crore and the same amount is required for renovation of first three floors of the Municipal Corporation building in Sector 17.To increase its revenue, the general house in its meeting in March had approved the hike in parking rates but till now the new rates have not been implemented. The MC has been claiming that the company managing the parking lots is yet to bring in smart parking facilities because of which new rates are not being implemented. Sources said that the BJP-led Municipal Corporation has deferred the hike in rates till the mayoral polls which are scheduled to be held after two months.Rs 179 crore',real

Sirsa — who is from the Shiromani Akali Dal, a BJP ally — said the name change would negate the legacy of Dyal Singh Majithia, after whom the college is named, as it was his efforts that resulted in the college getting its land on lease in 1960. “Dyal Singh (Evening) College is an important part of the Dyal Singh Trust. Changing the name is like negating his legacy,” Sirsa said. “We will not let the name change happen. If it is not revoked, it would result in unpleasant protests,” Sirsa said, adding that he had spoken to the chairman of the college’s management committee to not initiate the process.Student organisations also hit out at the move, saying it was a tactic to divert attention from the fundamental issue of lack of infrastructure. Calling the name change a “jumla”, the Congress-backed National Students’ Union of India (NSUI) said they “will welcome this new trend of renaming colleges if students are provided proper infrastructure and facilities”. They also sought an explanation from the college’s Governing Body on how two day colleges can function from an 11-acre campus. “There are 6,000 and 2,500 students in the Morning and Evening colleges respectively. The evening college students have been promised a separate building, but nothing has been done so far.”Neeraj Mishra, communication-in-charge of NSUI, said: “The annual exam is held in the canteen due to lack of space. The library can barely accommodate 50 students. In a classroom meant for 30 students, 70 are forced to sit and attend lectures. Some classrooms are separated by steel cupboards instead of walls. Changing the college’s name is just a smokescreen to distract students from these issues.”The All India Students’ Association (AISA) also said the move is an “attack” on Majithia. The ABVP, however, asked why there was a problem with the name. “Why will anyone have a problem with Vande Mataram? It is neither the name of a person nor of a political group. It is the national song of the country. Who can hate the name?” Bharat Katana, ABVP Delhi state secretary, said.',real

'Last Updated Jun 8, 2017 8:23 PM EDTNEW YORK -- Two chimpanzees have been denied the legal rights of people in New York.Nonhuman Rights Project attorney Steven Wise had argued to an appeals court in March that caged adult male chimps Tommy and Kiko should be granted a writ of habeas corpus. For people, habeas corpus relates to whether someone is being unlawfully detained and should see a judge.The chimps were caged in a trailer lot and at a primate sanctuary. Wise argued they should be moved to a large outdoor sanctuary in Florida instead of being caged.The appeals court Thursday upheld a lower-court ruling. It says Wise\'s intention is praiseworthy and \"laudable\" but there\'s no precedent in New York law for considering a chimp as a legal person.Wise and the animal rights group have pursued similar cases before. Wise argued on behalf of two other chimps, Hercules and Leo, in an attempt to get them moved from Stony Brook University on Long Island to a sanctuary in Florida, but after two years of litigation he lost the case in 2016.The rights project also pursued a case in upstate New York\'s Fulton County involving a 26-year-old chimp named Tommy. A state appeals court ruled against them in 2014.Wise issued a statement to CBS News in response to Thursday\'s ruling.\"For 2000 years all nonhuman animals have been legal things who lack the capacity for any legal rights,\" the statement read. \"This is not going to change without a struggle. That fight has begun and we remain confident that Tommy\'s and Kiko\'s fundamental right to bodily liberty will be recognized as a matter of justice so that they too may experience the freedom they so desperately deserve. Public opinion has begun to tilt in our favor since we started filing these lawsuits, likely as a result of them.\"',real

'BEIJING: A top Chinese envoy landed in North Korea today in a trip hailed as a \"big move\" by US President Donald Trump, who has urged Beijing to pile pressure on its nuclear-armed ally. Diplomat Song Tao is visiting the North on behalf of President Xi Jinping to brief officials on the recent Chinese Communist Party congress and other \"issues of mutual interest\", foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said. He is the first major Chinese envoy to visit Pyongyang in more than a year with ties severely strained between the two countries. Analysts expect Song to address the nuclear standoff, which has roiled relations between the two Cold War-era allies as China has backed United Nations sanctions on North Korea over its missile tests and sixth nuclear blast. Trump, who warned Xi during his trip to Beijing last week that time was \"quickly running out\" to solve the nuclear crisis, took to Twitter on Thursday to hail the mission as \"a big move, we\'ll see what happens!\". A brief report from North Korea\'s state-run KCNA news agency this morning confirmed Song had landed and met with Choe Ryong-Hae, a senior Pyongyang official and a close aide of leader Kim Jong-Un. The report said Song told his hosts China wanted to \"develop the traditional friendly relations between the two parties and countries\" but contained no further details of what was discussed. Washington wants China, which accounts for 90 per cent of North Korea\'s foreign trade, to put more economic pressure on the reclusive regime. But experts doubt Song\'s visit will yield major breakthroughs. \"China has virtually no political influence on North Korea. Its influence is derived from economic leverage,\" Bonnie Glaser, China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, told AFP. \"Relations are extremely stressed. Perhaps the lowest point since the Korean War,\" she said. \"Perhaps (the mission) will put a floor under China-North Korea relations, preventing further deterioration.\" China has imposed its own banking restrictions on North Koreans in addition to enacting a series of UN measures that include bans on imports of coal, iron ore and seafood from the North. But Beijing fears that squeezing Pyongyang too hard would cause its collapse. Song is the first Chinese envoy to make an official trip to North Korea since October 2016, when vice foreign minister Liu Zhenmin visited. Geng gave scant details about the trip, saying he did not know who he would meet or what topics he would discuss. China\'s relations with North Korea are currently at \"the lowest point they\'ve been in history\", leaving the North diplomatically at its most isolated, said Lu Chao, director of the North Korea Research Centre at the Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences. As a high-level diplomat, Song would likely meet directly with North Korea\'s top leaders, he said. \"As far as North Korea is concerned, China\'s opinion is still an important one and will certainly arouse their full attention,\" Lu said. As nuclear tensions have soared, Xi has pushed for negotiations and a \"dual track approach\" in which the United States would freeze its military drills in the region while North Korea halts its weapons programmes. Trump claimed this week that Xi had agreed to drop his plan during their talks last week, but Beijing stood by its policy. \"We believe that at the moment, this is the most realistic, feasible, fair and reasonable plan,\" Geng told a regular news briefing. Yuan Jingdong, a specialist in Asia-Pacific security issues at the University of Sydney, expects little from Song\'s mission. \"We can expect some face-saving, assuring but very general and abstract commitments with no substance changes in North Korea\'s nuclear and missile programmes,\" Yuan said. The visit is \"more about warning North Korea against going to extremes than forcing it to give up the nukes\" because China\'s top priority remains maintaining regional stability, he said. Song would likely \"assure Kim that if he behaves within a reasonable bound he can expect Beijing to continue providing some assistance and resist broadening the sanctions.\" Get latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.',real
'BEIJING: China said on Monday that it \"firmly opposes\" President Ram Nath Kovind\'s weekend visit to Arunachal Pradesh. \"China has never acknowledged so-called Arunachal Pradesh and China\'s position on the border issue is consistent and clear,\" Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lu Kang said in reply to a question from the Chinese media at the ministry\'s regular briefing. In a statement meant to address the Indian media, the ministry said, \"China and India are in the process of settling the issue through negotiation and consultations. We seek a fair, reasonable solution acceptable to all.\" China claims ownership of Arunachal Pradesh describing it as Southern Tibet. It had earlier objected to the Dalai Lama\'s visit to the state. But it is only of late that it has started opposing visits by elected Indian officials including defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman and now the President. Lu said that India-China relations are \"in a crucial moment\". China \"hopes the Indian side can refrain from complicating the border situation and create favourable conditions for sound and steady development of bilateral relations\". India and China had their first border consultation after the Doklam stand-off last week. Chinese foreign ministry said the talks were \"in the fundamental interest of both countries to maintain the healthy and stable development of China-India relations and is also the common expectation of both the region and the international community\". \"In the next stage,\" the ministry said, \"the two sides will continue to implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, maintain high-level exchanges and enhance strategic mutual trust, properly handle differences, and promote the further development of Sino-Indian relations.\" President Kovind spoke at the Arunachal assembly on Sunday saying \"diversity was the country\'s strength\" and said the state was \"the jewel in the crown\" in the Northeast.

'BEIJING: Chinese President Xi Jinping has sent North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un a rare message \"out of politeness,\" Beijing said on Thursday, in his first public communication with his wayward neighbour for more than a year. The note signalled a possible improvement in their strained relationship, which has soured over Pyongyang\'s growing weapons ambitions even though Beijing is its longtime ally and economic benefactor. Xi\'s message, dated yesterday, was sent in response to congratulations from Kim last week for securing a second term as the head of China\'s ruling party. \"I wish that under the new situation the Chinese side would make efforts with the DPRK side to promote the relations between the two parties and the two countries to sustainable soundness and stable development,\" Xi said, according to the North\'s KCNA news agency, addressing Kim as \"Comrade Chairman\". In his earlier note, Kim had offered Xi his \"sincere congratulations\" and expressed his belief that their relations would develop \"in the interests of the people of the two countries\". Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular press briefing in Beijing on Thursday that North Korea\'s message was just one among many others received. Xi had responded \"out of politeness,\" she said. The last time KCNA reported a message from Xi was in July 2016. Analysts say that such exchanges have become extremely rare under the current leaders, even though Beijing and Pyongyang traditionally sent greetings and congratulations on each other\'s key anniversaries in the past. Their relationship was forged in the bloodshed of the Korean War, when Mao Zedong sent millions of \"volunteers\" to fight US-led United Nations forces to a standstill. Mao described the allies as close as \"lips and teeth\", and China has long been accused of failing to enforce United Nations sanctions against the North for its banned nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes, even after voting for them in the Security Council. But Beijing has grown increasingly frustrated by its belligerent neighbour, and rapidly backed a new set of UN measures after a flurry of missile launches by the North and its sixth nuclear test in September. Professor Yang Moo-Jin of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul said the public exchange of messages signalled a willingness on both sides to improve relations. \"The fact that both sides are swiftly trading letters and announcing it carries a symbolic meaning,\" Yang told AFP. \"If the message was more intimate, we could expect a faster thawing of ties,\" he added, \"but for now, it shows that both sides agree on the need to improve their relations\".

'TOKYO: A one-time millionairess dubbed the \"Black Widow\" over the untimely deaths of lovers and a husband was sentenced to death on Tuesday, in a high-profile murder case that has gripped Japan. Kyoto District Court condemned Chisako Kakehi, 70, to the gallows for the murder of three men, including a husband, and the attempted murder of another, a court official said. Kakehi has become notorious over accusations she dispatched a number of elderly men she was involved with, drawing comparisons with the spider that kills its mate after copulation. Prosecutors said she used cyanide to rid herself of her lovers, amassing a reported one billion yen ($8.8 million) in payouts over 10 years. Kakehi initially refused to speak when her trial began in June but later stunned the court by admitting having killed her fourth husband in 2013. She had relationships with many men, mostly elderly or ill, meeting some through dating agencies, where she reportedly stipulated that prospective partners should be wealthy and childless. Prosecutors have said the men perished at her hands after making her the beneficiary of life assurance policies that ran into millions of dollars.

'AHMEDABAD: Even though only two days are left to file nominations for the first phase of Gujarat polls, the Congress is yet to announce its candidates as the party is trying to strike the delicate caste balance while doing the quota tight rope and grappling internal factionalism. The list is likely to be announced tonight when a meeting is scheduled between PAAS leaders and the Congress. \"Our list will be declared this evening,\" Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi said without elaborating. While Hardik Patel-led Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS), which is playing a hardball with the grand old party given its hold on the numerically strong community, has demanded around 20 seats from the Congress quota, Alpesh Thakor-led OBC group has demanded 12 seats, which has delayed the Congress\' list. Thakor had joined the Congress recently. Moreover, groupism and dissension in the state Congress unit is also said to be a reason behind the delay in finalising candidates. On the contrary, the ruling BJP has announced 106 candidates out of total 182 seats, by releasing two lists so far. While polling for 89 constituencies will be held on December 9, remaining 93 seats will go to polls on December 14. The last date for filing nominations for the first phase is November 21. A Congress leader, who is in the know of the ongoing negotiations, today said the issue of allocation of seats would be resolved soon. \"The delay in declaring the list of candidates is due to the ongoing negotiations between PAAS and the Congress party on PAAS\' demand for seats. The PAAS has demanded around 20 seats while the OBC group led by Alpesh Thakore has staked claim to around 12 to 15 seats,\" party sources said. Hardik Patel, who has emerged as the protagonist of caste consolidation, had set the Congress\' commitment to quota for Patidars under OBC category as the pre-condition to extend his community\'s support to the party. Senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal had held a meeting with PAAS representatives and handed three options to the community on the quota issue. Hardik recently said that if Congress finds PAAS leaders fit enough to contest polls then they can fight elections. One of the PAAS conveners Lalit Vasoya today declared that Congress is offering him a ticket from Dhroaji seat and he will fill up his nomination form tomorrow. A delegation of PAAS leaders had gone to Delhi two days back and demanded 30 seats from the Congress which held its Central Election Committee meeting under Sonia Gandhi. The Congress, however, had rejected the demand. According to sources in Congress, the PAAS has reduced the number of seats it wanted to contest. \"PAAS has reduced the number of seats it wanted to contest than their previous demand. Negotiations are on between the Congress and PAAS. We hope the issue will be resolved soon,\" sources said. PAAS leader Dinesh Bambhaniya said the Congress has invited them for a meeting this evening wherein the quota issue would be discussed with state Congress leaders. Sources said seat-sharing would be finalised at the meeting. The other reason for the delay in declaring the list is infighting and groupism in the Congress party. \"There is also some internal bickering between various groups in the party for tickets, which is another factor for delay in declaration of list,\" sources said. In run-up to the 2012 assembly elections in Gujarat, the Congress had not officially issued the list of candidates and had directed the party candidates to file their nominations on telephone.

'PITHORAGARH: The work on the all-weather road in Uttarakhand has begun with the construction of the 150-km Tanakpur-Pithoragarh stretch which will make it easier for the armed forces to mobilise troops and armaments to the India-China border, officials said on Monday. The section is a part of the \'All-Weather Roads Project\' launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the state assembly polls earlier this year. It is likely to be completed by 2019. Mobilisation of forces and their armaments to the last posts on the India-China border in times of emergency will be much easier from the Tanakpur rail-head after the 150-km stretch is completed, officials associated with the project said. \"Construction of the 150-km long Tanakpur to Pithoragarh road is being carried out on war footing to meet the set time the 2019 deadline. The deadline is likely to be easily met as the route has no over bridges or tunnels,\" said LD Mathela, executive engineer of NH 125. The cost of the road, will be approximately Rs 1,065 crore, which excludes the cost of three bypasses, he said. Unlike Garhwal, the nature of soil in the Kumaon region as well as the costs involved are not suitable for building tunnels and over bridges, the official said. \"Non-availability of non-rocky hill portion along the route is also a reason why no tunnels or over bridges are being built on the stretch,\" he said. The road is being constructed under the \'Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC)\' module in which the designs of the project, outlines by experts, will be availed by the construction company, Mathela said. \"Four companies have been assigned the task of constructing the road. These companies have been enlisted after their experience in constructing all-weather roads was scrutinised,\" the engineer said. The 12-meter wide road would be constructed by 2019 for which time and cost has been fixed by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), sources said. \"According to the design submitted by the construction companies, the protection of sliding portions on the road will be given equal significance to make it weather resistant,\" Mathela said. The official said that 7,000 trees would be uprooted for the construction of the road. \"Once built it will be able to bear the weight and width of all defence armaments required at the time of an emergency at border posts along the India-China border which is 200km from the tail of the all-weather road in Pithoragarh town,\" he said.

It had filed IPO papers with the market watchdog in September. Amber had Rs 415 crore debt as of August-end and as per the IPO papers, it proposes to utilise around Rs 345 crore from the share sale to repay debt.“We’d filed the draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) with the Sebi on September 29.

A trapper lassoed the animal along the boardwalk where Hollywood Beach ends.The American crocodile -- which is listed as an endangered species in the U.S. and the State of Florida -- lives in coastal areas throughout the Caribbean with the northern end of their range in South Florida.Crocodiles are shy, reclusive animals who live in brackish or saltwater areas. They are occasionally found inland in freshwater areas of the southeast Florida coast as a result of the extensive canal system.Researchers estimate there are only 400 to 500 crocodiles living in Florida.Authorities did not say what will happen to the now captured crocodile.',real
'A whistle. Then, boom. Seven short blasts and a long hoarse boom. The Baltic Sea was frigid, the breeze bitter and the sunbed on my private deck the colour of a doleful Danish sky. After a long flight from Mumbai to Copenhagen, I had put my feet up on a 1,46,000 tonne, 1,068-ft long Norwegian Getaway cruise liner, when the maritime distress signal roared. My mind immediately remembered vignettes of drowning men, floating dinner plates and chaos aboard the doomed Titanic. Boom. I had to run to the muster point, F9. I wrapped a scarlet dourukha (shawl) and ran down the staircase. At F9, women in little black dresses and pearl chokers were sitting crosslegged with goblets in hand, men were guffawing and stewards looked relaxed. This did not smell of any catastrophe. “There is no emergency. This is a mandatory drill”, a guttural voice bellowed.With that began my eight-day, 1,992 nautical mile cruise through six cities in Europe and Russia. After the drill, I plonked on a white Chesterfield and ran through the itinerary — sailing from Copenhagen (Denmark), docking in ports of Warnemunde (Germany), Tallinn (Estonia), Helsinki (Finland), St Petersburg (Russia), Nynashamn (Sweden) — and two days entirely on the sea.But before I could feel blue about the sea-bound days, there was an array of services to choose from. Swim in a heated pool on deck 15; slough off urban malice in the spa; get butt-numb in an ice bar, sitting on an ice chair and sipping out of an ice glass; pick from 22 eating joints manned by 233 chefs; watch movies on two-storey high television screens. The to-do list on the ship was unending. The Norwegian Getaway resembled a tony town with 4,000 guests and 1,650 employees to man it.In that tony town of a cruise ship, every morning there was a near mass exodus. After a large breakfast, one had to line up in the theatre space, a yellow ticket in hand, to get a bus number glued to your chest. Then, down the stairs to listen to the instructions and off for the day trip. On Day 2, it was a three-hour train ride from Warnemunde port to Berlin where the bus meandered through iconic buildings, including the Reichstag, Brandenburg Gate, Neue Synagogue, Kaiser Wilhelm Church (where the walls are made of a concrete honeycomb containing 21,292 stained glass inlays), the Berlin Wall, now covered in graffiti), and the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe with 27,111 concrete slabs that resemble coffins. The unnamed coffins look strangely bare — no epitaph, no tears, no flowers, no votive candles.It had rained in Warnemunde. The wharf was slippery but the painted mermaid on the hull looked gleeful. Berlin was a burden on my heart — I would have retreated to my room, but for a song that lured me to Deck 7, where a man in black was belting out an Elvis Presley number. A teppanyaki chef ensured giggles as he juggled three eggs on a spatula and pulled a toy chick out of his toque.By Day 3, I was a pro at the morning exodus. Following the guide like an obedient school girl, I strolled in the rainy city of Tallinn — where a tower is called Fat Margaret and WiFi is considered a human right. Another day, the ship hooted to a halt in Helsinki. The routine repeated in St Petersburg and Stockholm. Sadly, I had barely half a day in Stockholm. If I could stretch time, I would have happily booked a seat in Teater Dur och Moll, Europe’s smallest theatre that can only seat 20. Or, booked a table in Restaurant Stadshuskällaren that serves Nobel Prize banquet meals with menus dating from 1901 to now.',real
'BHUBANESWAR: India should pay more attention to its ancient knowledge, Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama said here on Monday. Speaking to reporters, the Nobel Peace Prize Laureate said that there is some kind of crisis about tackling emotions in the world. \"Now in that case, ancient Indian knowledge about tackling emotion is very relevant,\" he said, beginning his three-day Odisha visit. Stating that the modern education system and technology in India is highly developed, the 82-year-old Buddhist monk said, \"That is wonderful, but (in the) meantime, India should pay more attention to ancient year knowledge (on) how to tackle our emotions. That is very important.\" The spiritual leader, who spoke to media at Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik\'s residence here after meeting the CM, showered lavish praise on Naveen for \"winning people\'s trust\" for so long. Naveen later tweeted, \"Honoured to receive His Holiness @DalaiLama at my residence today. Discussed many issues of contemporary importance and sought his blessings and guidance for working towards our state\'s development and welfare of the people.\" The Dalai Lama is scheduled to be conferred the 10th \"KISS Humanitarian Award\" by Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences on Tuesday. The spiritual leader, who is on a week-long three-city tour to Delhi, Bhubaneswar and Kolkata, is scheduled to leave for Kolkata on November 22.

'A family in Michigan is scratching their heads after discovering unusual tenants inside their garage last week.On the floor of their unheated, detached garage in Davison, they spotted two long-legged spiders, which turned out to be brown recluse spiders -- a dangerous type of spider with a powerful bite. Most bites are minor, but occasionally, skin around a brown recluse bite will become necrotic, turning a dark color and becoming a deep, open sore as it dies.The family has no idea where the quarter-sized spiders came from or how they made their way into their garage.Howard Russell, an entomologist at Michigan State University Diagnostic Services, confirmed the spiders were, in fact, brown recluses.\"I\'ve been doing this for 30 years,\" Russell told CBS News. \"I\'ve had eight brown recluse out of thousands of spiders submitted, so they\'re rare.\"Russell explained that brown recluse spiders are usually found in more southern states with warmer climates, such as Tennessee, Arkansas, Missouri or Kentucky.\"That seems to be the heart of where they\'re found,\" Russell said.So it was surprising to stumble across the dangerous brown recluse in such a cool climate.\"The spiders had survived the winter in that unheated garage,\" Russell added. \"There was no recent history of travel, in some other cases there were.\"In 2011, there were three isolated populations of the brown recluse reported in Lansing, Hillsdale and Flint. Since then, three additional populations of the brown recluse have been confirmed in Michigan. These new finds were located in Tecumseh in 2015, Ann Arbor in 2016 and now Davison in 2017.\"The Tecumseh population was sharing a home with a human family of five including three young children and two dogs. The homeowner believes the spiders arrived with new kitchen cabinets the previous owner had installed before the family purchased it,\" according to a recent Michigan State University Extension report. \"The Ann Arbor specimen came from a building on the University of Michigan campus.\"Now Russell is trying to figure out where these creatures came from.\"The interesting question research-wise here: Do these represent sort of a transported population or does this represent the leading edge of a spread of these things to the Midwest?\" he asked.While it may be a frightening finding, Russell wants to assure residents there are deadlier species.\"We have Northern Widows up here, too, which are probably as dangerous or more dangerous than recluse spiders,\" Russell said. \"A lot more people get sick by bee or wasp stings.\"If you spot a spider that resembles the brown recluse, call an expert, Russell advises.\"Have it confirmed by somebody who actually knows spiders -- and possibly confirmed by somebody who doesn\'t have business interest in the result of that determination,\" he adds.',real
'The Binay Tamang-Anit Thapa led faction of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) will hold its first ever public meeting at 11 am in Darjeeling on Sunday after the two leaders were expelled from the GJM by party chief Bimal Gurung in September. It will also be the first ever meeting after the state government had set up a Board of Administrators for the Hills, with Tamang as its chairman.While the faction had held several smaller meetings in Kurseong (Thapa’s stronghold) and in Kalimpong, the Sunday’s meeting is likely to determine whether it has actually gained traction in the Hills following the over three-month-long indefinite bandh for a separate state of Gorkhaland.Darjeeling has always been a stronghold of Gurung and his own constituency, Tukvar, falls in the district.\r\nThapa, one of the main speakers at Sunday’s meeting, admitted that the rally is being held to determine how much strength their faction has gained.“We will of course talk about our plans, our (future) road map, what development projects we have in mind for the Hills, how they will be implemented and how we plan to take the cause of Gorkhaland forward. But, essentially the meeting is being held to see how much traction we have gained, and how much support we have managed to garner in Darjeeling,” he said.Thapa added that their faction has held numerous meetings in Kurseong, Kalimpong and other areas over the last few months. He said that according to their estimates, the faction expects at least 15,000 supporters on Sunday.\r\n“Of course Gorkhaland is still on the table. But not in the form of the agitation we have just gone through — with innumerable sufferings for the people and violence. People were completely fed up of the indefinite strike. Even if we call a similar strike now, we would lose support,” he said.Meanwhile, in anticipation of Sunday’s public meeting, Gurung on Friday released an audio message from an undisclosed location, asking the people of the Hills to not attend the rally. Announcing that November 19 will be observed as a ‘Black Day’ in Darjeeling, Gurung said that “it is a ploy” by the Mamata Banerjee-led government to show that Tamang is now the leader of the Hills and also to veer the agitation away from Gorkhaland.Reacting to Gurung’s call for a boycott of the meeting, Thapa said, “Ab who bhi kya karega bechara. All he can do now is release these audio recordings. I believe that we have managed to capture the Hills already.”\r\nPolitical observers in the Hills, however, described the scheduled meeting as “nothing less than a watershed moment for Darjeeling politics”.“Tomorrow’s meeting will determine the future course that the Hill politics will take. If the Tamang faction can show that it has the requisite strength and if thousands of people turn up for the meeting, then it will show that the Gurung faction is waning and that the new leadership has made inroads into Hill politics. Not just Tamang, but there will be space created for new leaders from GNLF and Jan Andolan Party,” said a political analyst in Darjeeling.The analyst added, “There is a possibility that many will show up tomorrow despite Gurung’s warning. The 104-day strike (demanding a separate state of Gorkhaland) was a bit too much for the people to take and led to a lot of sufferings.”“From what I have heard, the Tamang faction has also penetrated into Tukvar. Many GJM co-founders have switched over to the Tamang faction — Dawa Lhama, Jyoti Rai and Diwakar Gurung — just to name a few. There were around 90 members in GJM’s central committee and 35 have already switched over to the Tamang faction,” the analyst said.\r\nSources said that in the coming days, the Tamang faction is likely to reconstitute its central committee, inducting more members into it.',real
'A set up against a man he’d never lost to, Roger Federer looked to be cruising toward a shot at a seventh ATP Finals title. David Goffin had other ideas.The Belgian rallied in the semifinals on Saturday to claim the biggest win of his career and stun the favorite 2-6, 6-3, 6-4.“It is the best win of my career, for sure,” Goffin said.“I started to feel the ball better at the end of the first set, so I wanted to be more aggressive. It paid off. I started to serve well. My forehand was going much better.”Federer was on course to reach his 11th final at the elite season-ending tournament when he cruised through the first set, but Goffin took advantage of a drop in his play to force a third set.Despite having lost all six of his previous encounters with Federer, Goffin was able to execute better in the decider, breaking in the third game and producing a nerveless display of serving.In the final on Sunday he will face Grigor Dimitrov or Jack Sock. They play later Saturday.“I just think he raised his game,” Federer said. “I couldn’t follow any more. Maybe my game dropped naturally a little bit because he was playing better.”Having won all three of his round-robin matches at the O2 Arena, Federer continued his fine form to break twice in the first set.However, the match turned in the second game of the second set. Federer wasted two game points on his serve before Goffin produced a forehand passing shot to take his first break point of the match.“It was a tough game to get broken at 1-0,” Federer said. “I had I think multiple game chances to get out of the game and go 1-1, keep the pressure up. I think things really turned around for him at that moment.”The winners flowed from Goffin’s racket, unsettling Federer, who coughed up uncharacteristic errors.Goffin needed just the one break in both the second and third sets and displayed a previously unseen grit to deny Federer his lone break point opportunities in either set.The match was typical of Goffin’s inconsistent week on his full debut at the tournament, after he played one match as an alternate a year ago.After defeating a wounded Rafael Nadal in his opening match, he was thrashed in just 74 minutes by Dimitrov, before qualifying for the semis with a comfortable win over Dominic Thiem.“Both are really special,” said Goffin, after becoming only the sixth man to defeat Nadal and Federer in the same tournament. “It was the first time against Rafa. Then the semifinal for the first time for me here, and to beat Roger for the first time here in such a big event, big tournament, it was the perfect moment.”',real
'Title: New Wealth of Nations\r\nAuthor: Surjit S Bhalla\r\nPublisher: Simon and Schuster\r\nPages: 224\r\nPrice: Rs 599The great inflation decline (GID)Today, we are back to the low inflation era of the 1950s and 1960s. For the 17 years following 1951, Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation in the US averaged 1.7 per cent, and the medium inflation in the AEs averaged 2.8 per cent. For the years 2000–2016, US inflation was 2.1 per cent, and in AEs, 1.9 per cent.Inflation jumped in the world in 1972 due to a wheat shortage, and the Yom Kippur war of October 1973 induced double-digit world inflation — the first time in world history, and very likely the last time. Oil prices quadrupled in 1973 and the world experienced a phenomenon which came to be known as ‘stagflation’ — a word invented to describe low output growth and high inflation, something neither the monetarists nor the Keynesians thought possible.Then came Paul Volcker who fought inflation, and won. Volcker was brought in by President Carter to head the US Fed in 1979, with the near explicit mandate to fight double-digit inflation. This, he did. In fact, he was so successful and popular that Republican President Reagan reappointed him in 1983. Volcker’s second term came to an end in August 1987. No necessary causation here, but less than two months after his leaving, the US stock market crashed by 25 per cent in one day.By 1984, OPEC inflation had run its course. From double digit inflation for most of the period from 1973 to 1983, median inflation in the advanced economies (AEs) was reduced to 6.2 per cent in 1984 and 5.7 per cent in 1985. From the early 1990s, median inflation has stayed well below 4 per cent and close to 2 per cent. This is what can be termed the ‘great inflation decline’ (GID), and it’s a phenomenon crying out for an explanation.Economists have tried various explanations for the GID. My favourite explanation is also a favourite among many economists, including officials of the Reserve Bank of India. The reasoning centres around a three-letter word — oil — as it did 45 years ago. But has oil mattered for inflation since the early 1980s? Between 1998 and 2007, oil prices quintupled (from US $14.4 for a West Texas intermediate barrel in 1998 to US $72 in 2007, before peaking at around US $160 in 2008), and inflation in the AEs and in a large number of emerging market economies was lower by half a percentage point.Today, the US economy is as close to full employment as it has ever been, and yet there is no sign of inflation. The GID has caused the central banks in the world to fight a different and unprecedented battle — how to increase the inflation rate. Over the last few years, central banks (the Fed, ECB, and the Bank of Japan) are fighting, clamouring, plotting, and begging to get the inflation rate up to 2 per cent, and ‘obviously’ not succeeding. What could be the reason?The reason is that the world has changed, and the old models do not fit the facts of the new world. And the world changed more than 20 years ago. Misinterpreting this change or not acknowledging it has led central bankers to make big policy mistakes. One such prominent central banker was Alan Greenspan.How one central banker misinterpreted the great inflation declineIn February 1995, barely two months after the large Mexican currency devaluation of December 1994, Fed chairman Alan Greenspan raised interest rates in the US by a half percentage point to 6 per cent. For the uninitiated, half a per cent (50 basis points) is a very large move by the US Fed and not that usual with inflation hovering around 3 per cent.Greenspan was wrong on at least two counts. First, he could not conceive that a large Mexican devaluation of December 1994, affecting at least all of Latin America and most of the East, would or should have an impact on US inflation, and consequently on the US monetary policy and its fight to keep inflation low. Traditional monetary policy was fast declining as an instrument for attacking inflation even then.The second error of the redoubtable Greenspan was in thinking that inflation in the US was a problem. In 1994, consumer prices had increased by 2.6 per cent, having increased by a seemingly large 3 per cent the year before. What Greenspan was apparently attempting to attack was not inflation, but future impending inflation to be brought upon by the higher than inflation-neutral GDP growth in the future. That is a mouthful (my apologies) but it gets to the heart of the puzzle, and how the central bankers have adamantly refused to see the… writing on the wall. In 1994, GDP growth in the US was a high 4 per cent and Greenspan (wrongly) inferred that this high growth would induce higher inflation.It is instructive to see how un-right or un-prescient the leading central banker in the world was about future US events. In 1995, the year of the great strike against impending inflation, US GDP growth recorded 2.7 per cent, and would not record lower GDP growth until the 9–11 year. For the next five years (1996–2000), US GDP growth averaged 4.3 per cent per annum; US CPI inflation averaged 2.5 per cent per annum. During the previous decade, US GDP growth averaged 3.1 per cent, and US inflation 3.6 per cent. This was the first warning sign that ignoring higher education (skilled labour) in the developing world would lead to domestic policy mistakes.Explaining the great inflation decline: The usual suspects fail…Low inflation has been a phenomenon for the last 20 years. That is what we have to seek an explanation for. Topping the list of claimants seeking credit for low inflation, you guessed it, are central banks. These central banks are now more independent of government restraints (and constraints) than ever before, and surely this institutional change has helped decrease inflation. The number of inflation-targeting countries has also increased, and these born-again inflation hawks fight even nonexistent inflation with the tenacity of a raging bull. Hence, inflation is low because of sensible central bank policies.',real
'HUE, Vietnam: The death toll rose to at least 27 on Sunday from the typhoon that pummelled central and southern Vietnam just days before the region is due to host the APEC summit of Asia-Pacific leaders. Typhoon Damrey, the 12th major storm to hit Vietnam this year, made landfall on Saturday with winds of up to 90 km/h (56 mph) that damaged more than 40,000 homes, knocked down electricity poles and uprooted trees. The communist state\'s Steering Committee for Disaster Prevention said 27 people were now counted dead and 22 were missing. It said 626 houses had collapsed entirely in a trail of destruction that has forced the evacuation of more than 30,000 people. Heavy rain and high winds lashed the coastal strip on Sunday. Flooding led to a 30 km (19 miles) tailback on Vietnam\'s main north-south highway in Thua Thien Hue province. Battle tanks were mobilised to help with rescue efforts. \"The floodwaters are rising very fast,\" said Dinh Cong Hoa, deputy commander of the provincial military command in Nha Trang, which bore the brunt of the typhoon. One middle-aged woman in Nha Trang, Vo Thi Tuyet Anh, told state television: \"I\'ve never seen such a strong storm since I was born.\" Danang, where the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit is taking place this week, is around 500 km (310 miles) to the north of Nha Trang. It also suffered. A gateway proclaiming \"Welcome to Danang\" collapsed in the storm, state media said. Authorities in the area called on citizens to volunteer to help clean up. Danang will host U.S. President Donald Trump from Nov. 10, as well as China\'s Xi Jinping, Russia\'s Vladimir Putin and counterparts from other APEC members. The storm moved from the coastal area into a key coffee-growing region of the world\'s biggest producer of robusta coffee beans. Traders had expected the storm to delay harvesting, but were not sure whether it would damage the crop. The government said on Saturday more than 40,000 hectares of crops had been damaged, including sugar cane, rice fields and rubber plantations. Floods killed more than 80 people in northern Vietnam last month, while a typhoon wreaked havoc in central provinces in September. The country of more than 90 million people is prone to destructive storms and flooding due to its long coastline.

'NEW DELHI: US economist and Nobel laureate Richard Thaler thinks that the Indian government\'s decision to demonetize high value currency notes was a \"good\" concept but its implementation was \"deeply flawed.\" Thaler further says that the move to introduce Rs 2,000 notes during the remonetisation exercise was \"puzzling\" and undercut the purpose of the note ban, considering that it aimed to crack down on the parallel economy and transform India into a less-cash society. All this emerged after Swaraj Kumar, a student of the Chicago University professor, approached him for his views on demonetisation. Kumar posted the email conversation with Thaler on his Twitter account. Here\'s what the economist had to say: \"The concept was good as a move to a cashless society to impede corruption but the rollout was deeply flawed and the introduction of the Rs 2000 note makes the motivation for the entire exercise puzzling.\" Kumar\'s tweet was later retweeted by Thaler\'s handle. This is the latest in a series of critiques the Nobel laureate has offered on demonetisation. On November 8, 2016, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi had made the surprise announcement to scrap Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes as legal tender, Thaler had hailed the ambitious move. \"This is a policy I have long supported. First step toward cashless and good start on reducing corruption,\" Thaler had said in a tweet then. This is a policy I have long supported. First step toward cashless and good start on reducing corruption. https://t.co/KFBLIJSrLr — Richard H Thaler (@R_Thaler) 1478617889000 But when he got to know that the government planned to introduce Rs 2,000 notes, he registered his surprise and skepticism in the following two-word tweet.

'For the last few weeks, the social web has been preoccupied with a hashtag and a list. #MeToo has been trending in different parts of the world, as it invites people who have suffered sexual abuse and violence — especially women — to come out and narrate their experience to name the problem that remains a well-known secret. The hashtag is a call for action to break through the taboo of owning sexual abuse and calling out the cultures of silence that protect sexual predators and perpetrators of violence.While there have been many battle calls in the past for victims of sexual abuse to not give in to shame, the response to this hashtag appears unprecedented because of two conditions that digital networks offer. The first is the possibility of anonymity. The victims can, while remaining anonymous, still express their grief, anger, frustration and despair at continued cycles of abuse. The second is the breaking of the isolation chambers, where they no longer feel isolated but realise that they are struggling to fight a larger problem — and that they have allies they can depend on.This digital invitation has generated an inspiring number of people — expectedly, largely women — who have produced the largest consolidated testimony of how everyday experiences of abuse become allowed, condoned, and even defended by institutions like families, markets and governments. The hashtag created a particular furore in India, because it elicited a militant response — #himtoo.There was a suggestion that maybe it is also time to name the perpetrators rather than just reliving grief and facing a politics of despair. A list was curated, first on Facebook and then on an open Google document, which named some very influential names within Indian (and some global) academic institutions. Some of these names already have a history of public accusations and legal cases. Some of the names opened up a stream of accusations, which have been shored up but never released for the power that their institutional positions wield. And a few of the names were shocking because they are people who have positioned themselves as allies in the social justice movements in the country. Indeed, some of the men on the list have made professional academic careers out of their solidarity with women’s and queer rights activism.The list — digital in nature and hence, unforgiving and unforgetting — has performed the act of transgression that digital technologies always offered the scope of. The list isn’t just content, but a potent digital object. It connects, circulates, and finds new relationships of causality and correlation that transcend localised human networks. The list has become a space of huge contention because the digital native feminists who are using social media to find solidarity in numbers and catharsis in naming are using newer strategies. These are particularly different from the pre-digital feminist tactics, which have depended more on secret connections and expanding circles of trust. There is, in the feminist groups within the country, a lot of debate (and some hostile name-calling) for and against the list.While there is much to think about and discuss, something that strikes me is that the debates follow an expected trope in digital activism. Researchers of digitally mediated activism have long warned that digital technologies have a strange way of turning the conversations inwards. Every time there is a digital platform or technology used to effect change, more often than not, the conversations end up being about the digital and its efficacy rather than the problems that are at hand. In this case, the entire debate seems to now be focused on whether the list is valid, whether the anonymous spaces of the social web are the best space for this activism, the potential for abuse if people with false agendas infiltrate these list-making exercises, and the labour of due process that must be performed to give the list credibility. All of these are fair debates. But it’s quite telling that the energy that should have been invested in thinking about systemic injustice and structural abuse is being diverted to thinking about digital technologies, forms, and processes.There are not going to be any easy answers to the list. However, there’s something we need to remember from the history of digital activism: we can’t lose focus of what is really at stake here — cultures of sexual violence that perpetuate themselves in silence — and we need to stop fetishising digital objects and processes as primary objects of our obsession.',real
'Dina Wadia, the only child of Pakistan founder Mohammed Ali Jinnah, passed away at her home in New York Thursday. She was 98.She was the mother of leading Parsi businessman Nusli Wadia who heads the Wadia Group which owns Bombay Dyeing, Britannia Industries and Go Air and is often described as India’s corporate samurai for his propensity to get involved in high power corporate disputes.Jinnah’s marriage to 16-year-old Ruttie Petit at the age of 42 scandalised Bombay society in the early 20th century. Ruttie was the only daughter of Sir Dinshaw Petit, the aristocratic Parsi Baronet, whose family was one of the first to open textile mills in Bombay and was renowned for charities. The Parsi community was up in arms at the impulsive and romantic Ruttie’s elopement and conversion. She was excommunicated from the community for all practical purposes.Author Sheela Reddy, in her recent book Mr and Mrs Jinnah, writes: “A strange flaw in Ruttie’s warm and affectionate personality was that she paid little attention to her only daughter, leaving her at home with nannies and maids.’’ In fact, Ruttie’s daughter was so ignored that she was not given a proper name till she was 10. Her mother passed away in tragic circumstances at the age of 29.Dina was the product of a doomed marriage of complete opposites. Jinnah, who was almost as old as Ruttie’s father, was dour, proud, withdrawn, cautious and from a conservative Khoja Muslim family. Ruttie was pampered, impulsive, emotional, extravagant and reckless.After his wife’s death, Jinnah became increasingly orthodox and preoccupied with his mission to carve out from India a separate Muslim majority country, Pakistan. He permitted Dina’s grandmother, Dinbai Petit, to have a major say in the upbringing of his daughter and even permitted the child to take her grandmother’s name. Despite the early tragedy in her life, Dina had, according to friends, a happy childhood and a friendly, warm and kindly disposition. She was brought up in a largely Parsi milieu.Jinnah was shocked when she informed him at the age of 17 that she intended to marry Neville Wadia, the scion of an equally illustrious Parsi family in the textile business. According to Jinnah’s one-time junior, the late Justice Mahommed Currim Chagla, Jinnah scolded his daughter and told her that there were millions of Muslim boys in India and she could have anyone she chose. Dina, who was more than a match for her father, replied, “Father, there were millions of Muslim girls in India. Why did you not marry one of them?’’For Jinnah, the marriage was a major political embarrassment. He became permanently estranged from his daughter and her family. Before leaving for the soon-to-be-formed Pakistan, he met his daughter for the last time along with her son Nusli and her daughter Diana. Dina made a trip to Pakistan in 2003, the first time since his funeral, to visit her father’s grave along with her son and two grandsons, Ness and Jeh. It came as a shock to most Pakistanis to discover that the descendants of the Quaid-e-Azam were in fact Parsis living in India, since it was kept a closely guarded secret by the Pakistani authorities for many years.In her later years, Dina lived mostly in New York though she made an annual trip to Mumbai to meet her family and friends. She was extremely close to son Nusli who visited her often.Incidentally, Dina was fighting a suit in court to claim legal possession of South Court on Malabar Hill, now usually referred to as Jinnah House. Valued at over $400 million, the stately bungalow, badly in need of repairs, has historical significance for the sub-continent since Jinnah, Jawaharlal Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi met there before the formation of Pakistan.',real
'The good thing about being a rich professional football player is you can afford $100,000 diamond earrings. The bad news is that if you wear them out jet skiing you can lose them in the water. But, as Julio Jones realized recently, there\'s a bonus to that, too: You can always just pay some divers to go looking for the earring.That is exactly what the Atlanta Falcons star wide receiver did recently after losing a massive, expensive earring in Lake Lanier, a lake in northern Georgia. Jones was out jet skiing when, according to WXII in Atlanta (via Deadspin) he hit a big wave and went flying off the jet ski.When Jones got back up on jet ski, he was missing a very expensive piece of jewelry. So he did what anyone else would do. He hired a guy to dive for the earring.So Bobby Griffin went diving into Lake Lanier, looking for the pricey item.\"I\'m getting ready to dive for a diamond,\" Griffin says in the video as he goes into the water. \"A diamond earring.\"One problem for Griffin came in the form of total darkness. WXII describes Lake Lanier as deep, but the divers, Griffin and Robbie Pickering, were only 65 feet down, hardly an unreasonable depth. But it\'s not like diving in the Caribbean -- when you get below about 30 feet in a lake, things get dark in a hurry.And because Lanier is a man-made lake that covered a bunch of communities that were submerged, as Deadspin pointed out, as well as a slew of trees that haven\'t been exposed to sunlight since the 1950\'s. An earring that costs $100K is a pretty big earring, but when it comes to slowly falling through murky water, it\'s a small metallic fish in a big pond.Finding it is a near impossible mission, and, for the diving crew, they ultimately came up short.Falcons training camp begins Thursday and goes through Aug. 4, The Associated Press reports.

'LONDON -- Doctors intending to perform cataract surgery on a 67-year-old woman in Britain found something rather unexpected: 17 contact lenses mashed together in her right eye.In a case report published Monday in the journal BMJ, the doctors said that the woman had worn monthly disposable contact lenses for 35 years; she had \"deep set eyes\" and poorer vision in that eye, which they said might have contributed to a failure to remove some of the lenses.The doctors said the 17 lenses were bound together by mucus. A further 10 were found by the surgeon using a microscope, for a total of 27 contact lenses. Rupal Morjaria, a specialist trainee in ophthalmology, said the \"large mass\" would have caused quite a lot of irritation.The patient had chalked it up to old age and dry eye, Morjaria said.\"None of us have ever seen this before,\" Morjaria told the publication Optometry Today. \"It was such a large mass. All the 17 contact lenses were stuck together. We were really surprised that the patient didn\'t notice it because it would cause quite a lot of irritation while it was sitting there.\"She said it\'s important for people who wear contacts to be conscientious about handling them safely and get regular check ups.\"Contact lenses are used all the time, but if they are not appropriately monitored we see people with serious eye infections that can cause them to lose their sight,\" Morjaria told Optometry Today.',real

'NEW DELHI: The free world\'s leader is not very popular in India. As per a survey conducted by American fact tank Pew Research Center, only 40 per cent of Indians surveyed, approved of US President Donald Trump, down 34 per cent points from 2015 and Barack Obama. Interestingly, this is still better than the average approval ratings for Trump in Europe and Japan, said Bruce Stokes, Director, Pew Global Economic Attitudes at Pew Research Center. Stokes, who led the survey conducted in February-March 2017, said, \"Overall, there is a decline in support for the United States and the US President since 2015, but it\'s still higher than the average in other European countries or Japan. That is very interesting.\" For instance, when asked, 28 per cent Indians felt that Donald Trump was \"dangerous\". This is much less than the average of over 60 per cent in some of the other countries surveyed. On being asked if Donald Trump is \"arrogant\", more than 70 percent in counties in Europe or Japan agreed. In India, the number was 26 per cent. In India though, 41 per cent believe that Trump is well qualified to be the US president. Also, 32 perc ent of those surveyed approves of Trump\'s policies, while 25 per cent backed Trump\'s decision to build a wall between the US and Mexico. 27 per cent also supported US\' decision to withdraw from the nuclear weapons agreement. A much higher number of respondents - 37 per cent - approved of the US president\'s decision to introduce tighter restrictions for those coming from some Muslim-majority countries. On being asked, what could be the reason for the apparent tolerance for Trump, Stokes said one of the factors was that many of those surveyed had no opinion on India\'s relations with the international community. \"One third or more of those surveyed expressed no opinions about other countries or PM Narendra Modi\'s handling of relations with prominent players on the world stage,\" explained Stokes. However, amongst those who did have an opinion, the more tolerant attitude could be because both countries have a conservative government in place, added Stokes. \"But the difference is interesting because it shows how the US or President Trump is perceived in India, and comparing it to his ratings elsewhere is intriguing,\" said Stokes.

'TOKYO: President Donald Trump ratcheted up the pressure on North Korea Monday, refusing to rule out eventual military action and declaring that the United States \"will not stand\" for Pyongyang menacing America or its Asian allies. Trump, on the first stop of his lengthy Asia trip, denounced North Korea as \"a threat to the civilized world,\" and exhorted dictator Kim Jong Un to cease weapons testing like the missiles he has fired over Japanese territory in recent weeks. Though he stood in one of the Asia capitals in range of North Korea\'s missiles, Trump did not modulate his fiery language, declaring that Pyongyang imperiled \"international peace and stability.\" \"Some people say my rhetoric is very strong but look what has happened with very weak rhetoric in the last 25 years,\" said Trump, who stood with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at a Monday news conference. Abe, who has taken a more hawkish view on North Korea than some of his predecessors, agreed with Trump\'s assessment that \"all options are on the table\" when dealing with Kim Jong Un and announced new sanctions against several dozen North Korea individuals. Trump and Abe have struck a strong friendship, forged in meetings, phone calls and on the golf course _ a friendship that was on display at a Monday evening banquet that was the final event of Trump\'s visit. In a toast, Trump told the story of how, after he won the election last November, he was bombarded by phone calls from world leaders offering congratulations. Trump said he\'d returned just a few _ including one from Abe _ who said he wanted to meet with Trump as soon as possible. Trump responded: anytime. Trump, as he told it, wasn\'t aware of the protocol against president-elects meeting with world leaders. By the time Trump called Abe to wave him off, however, Trump said Abe was already on the plane to New York. \"So I saw him and it worked out just fine,\" Trump recalled, saying, from that moment on, they\'d been close. Abe also called Trump his \"dear friend\" and hailed the benefits of what he called \"golf diplomacy.\" The two men on Monday also put a face on the threat posed by the North, earlier standing with anguished families of Japanese citizens snatched by Pyongyang\'s agents. Trump and first lady Melania Trump stood with nearly two dozen relatives, some of whom held photos of the missing. Seeking to increase pressure on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Trump pledged to work to return the missing to their families, saying \"it\'s a very, very sad number of stories that we\'ve heard.\" Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with families of Japanese abducted by North Korea in Tokyo on Nov. 6, 2017. North Korea has acknowledged apprehending 13 Japanese in the 1970s and 1980s, but claims they all died or have been released. But in Japan, where grieving relatives of the abducted have become a symbol of heartbreak on the scale of American POW families, the government insists many more were taken and that some may still be alive. Trump has delivered harsh denunciations of Kim, belittling him as \"Little Rocket Man\" but suggested that it would be \"a tremendous signal\" if North Korea returned the captives. But Trump\'s message on the second day of his five-country Asian tour was overshadowed by another tragic shooting back home. Trump called the Texas church shooting that claimed at least 26 lives \"an act of evil,\" denounced the violence in \"a place of sacred worship\" and pledged the full support of the federal government. He later suggested that the shooter had mental health issues and waved off a question about gun control, saying of the massacre, \"this isn\'t a guns situation.\" Though Trump and Abe repeatedly touted their friendship, looming disagreements on trade could strain the friendship. Trump complained Monday that Japan had been \"winning\" for decades and rebuked the current relationship, saying the trade deals were \"not fair and not open.\" He told a group of American and Japanese business leaders: the United States was open for business, but he wanted to reshape the nations\' trade relationship, though he did not say how he would cut the trade deficit with Japan, which totaled nearly $70 billion last year. He also downplayed the potentially contentious nature of the negotiations, though the Japanese government has not shown much appetite for striking a new bilateral trade agreement. Tokyo had pushed to preserve the Trans- Pacific Partnership, which Trump has abandoned. \"We will have more trade than anybody ever thought under TPP. That I can tell you,\" Trump said. He said the multinational agreement was not the right deal for the United States and that while \"probably some of you in this room disagree ... ultimately I\'ll be proven to be right.\" Abe, for his part, publicly deflected questions about trade. Trump also pushed Japan to buy more American military equipment after Abe was asked at the news conference about a local news report that Trump was disappointed that Japan had not shot North Korean missiles out of the sky. \"He will shoot `em out of the sky when he completes the purchase of lots of additional military equipment from the United States,\" Trump interrupted. Japan\'s constitution was revised after World War II to include a clause renouncing war and the country only spends about one percent of its GDP on defense, though Abe has slowly tried to remove some of its pacifist constraints. Japan orchestrated a lavish formal welcome for the Trumps, complete with military honor guard and an audience with Japan\'s Emperor Akihito and his wife, Empress Michiko, at the Imperial Palace. As part of the pageantry, Trump and Abe took part in a traditional feeding of koi in a pond Monday. At first, both leaders spooned out small amounts of feed into the pond below. Abe then lightly tossed the remainder of his box into the pond below, while Trump more theatrically dumped the rest of his box down to the fish. Abe laughed.

'Ever since I maligned them terribly in one of my books (The Tigers of Taboo Valley) by casting them as villainous terrorists out to exterminate tigers, I’ve felt a bit bad about it, and apologise for hurting any prickly sentiments. But to make up, somewhat, I did give them sweet names such as Col. ‘Cuddles’ Khujlimal — he was an Indian crested porcupine, leader of the dreaded Al Seekh Kebab Atankvaad Andolan.You may cuddle porcupines at your own risk, but tigers, leopards, wolves and hyenas are amongst their number one enemies for one reason: they like eating them. Porcupines protect themselves from becoming dinner by reversing at full speed into the faces of their attackers — sometimes blinding and laming them. Occasionally, porcupines injure them so badly that all they can hunt thereafter are humans — the easiest prey to kill. Thus are born some terrible pain-crazed man-eaters.However, let’s get one thing straight: porcupines (even American ones, which may be armed with up to 30,000 quills) do not shoot their quills at their victims. Porcupines just back into their victims/enemies at top speed, impaling them with dreadfully barbed quills and take off after. The quills stick inside their victims, turning them into pincushions as the porcupine scoots. There’s one more thing in the rodent’s defence: they first give fair warning about what’s to come. Long quills (brown or black, usually 30 cm long) on the neck and shoulder are attached to muscles under the skin, and become erect when a threat looms, to make the porcupine look larger and scarier. Hollow, whitish quills at the base of the tail are rattled as a warning: so the porcupine gives you both a visual and an aural warning (it also growls and grunts) before attacking. The back and rump are equipped with stabbing quills which do the damage. Quills, which are made of keratin, are modified hairs. They are soft and pliable at the time of birth, so as not to add to the agony of the mother’s labour pains. But they harden soon after birth.Porcupines, which are rodents — the third largest after the capybara and the beaver — are found nearly all over the world. The Indian crested porcupine (Hystrix indica) is a heavily built (18 kg), ponderous, rather myopic, nocturnal creature that needs to forage seven hours a night on roots, tubers, vegetable matter, fruit, small insects and vertebrates, augmenting its calcium and mineral intake (to strengthen its quills) by chewing on small bones. Armed with sharp chisel-like incisors, broad feet and long claws, it can play havoc in farmers’ fields with its heavy duty JCB-like nocturnal excavations. But it does spread seeds and pollen too, balancing things out somewhat. It is easy to hunt and is killed for its meat and quills, which are put to various uses, from mumbo-jumbo medicinal concoctions to hair accessories. Though not officially endangered, and of “least concern”, it is said that porcupine numbers are declining by as much as 10 per cent per year, and annual tribal hunts (in places like Assam) account for hundreds of victims.',real

'Paris St Germain’s unstoppable march towards the Ligue 1 title continued when Edinson Cavani’s double inspired them to a 4-1 home win against Nantes on Saturday.Cavani netted either side of half-time as Javier Pastore and Angel Di Maria also scored to put the unbeaten capital side on 35 points from 13 games, six ahead of second-placed Monaco after the champions were held to a 1-1 at Amiens on Friday.Nantes, who are fifth on 23 points, scored through Prejuce Nakoulma as Claudio Ranieri’s team faltered under pressure. The visitors got off to a solid start but cracked before half-time.Cavani opened the scoring with a clinical finish from inside the box after being perfectly set up by Pastore. It was the Uruguay striker’s 14th goal after 13 games in the league, the best tally in the French championship since Dick van Dijk with Nice in the 1972-73 season.Di Maria doubled the advantage three minutes later with a curled cross that nobody could connect with and ended up in the back of the net at the far post.Nakulma reduced the arrears on the hour mark from close range but Nantes’ hopes were short lived. Five minutes later, Pastore restored a two-goal advantage for the hosts with a powerful shot after being set up by Marco Verratti’s through ball.',real

'Book-The Book of Dust Volume 1: La Belle Sauvage\r\nAuthor-Philip Pullman\r\nPublication-David Fickling Books \r\nPages-624\r\nPrice- Rs 599As epic endings go, the final pages of The Amber Spyglass — the last of Philip Pullman’s His Dark Materials trilogy — are difficult to surpass. Lyra Silvertongue and Will Parry put an end to God, a mundane desert that is the afterlife, fall in love to save the multiverse and must live apart for the same reasons. Paradise was lost in Pullman’s fantasy world, and that was welcome, because paradise is a dangerous lie as are the churches that promise it. For those who read His Dark Materials as children (and likely re-read it as adults), La Belle Sauvage is another chance to enter a world where a repressive church and state try to control diversity, sexuality and knowledge.But while Northern Lights (the first part of the original trilogy) began in a baroque Oxford in a parallel universe, La Belle Sauvage is set in the countryside about a decade before the events in the previous trilogy. Malcolm Polstead, the protagonist, (quite unlike Lyra) is the ideal boy: His parents run a pub in Oxford, he loves his canoe – the La Belle Sauvage, is curious about literature and science and is quite the handyman.Malcom gradually gets involved with an anti-Church espionage unit through Dr Hannah Relf and with Lyra, a baby that is the product of scandal and intrigue in the highest political circles. The spectre of Dust — an elementary particle that disproves the idea of soul/spirit — haunts the book. We learn more about characters from the original trilogy and exactly how Lyra came to be raised at Jordan college in Oxford, her parents’ separation and the political rivalries that define her world, the nature of the alethiometer — a truth-telling device that operates through Dust. Figures like Farder Coram, wise and decrepit in the original, are seen in their prime as spies. Pullman’s affinity for biblical metaphors makes itself felt through the second half of the book. The La Belle Sauvage turns into Noah’s Ark and Malcolm and Alice (a working-class girl who turns a friend) try to get Lyra to safety through a flood of magical and mythical proportions.The plot and pace of La Belle Sauvage pale in comparison to Northern Lights. As a hero, Malcolm is simply too white-bread, although there are portends of the character going down dark, complex paths in the future. The book feels like a long setup to the sequel, which one hopes will move a little faster, go a little deeper. There is also the fact that for those who haven’t read His Dark Materials, much of the context of La Belle Sauvage will be difficult to decipher. Simply put, Pullman needed a better editor. But what makes The Book of Dust worth reading, especially for young people, is that Pullman has lost none of his courage when it comes to dealing with sexuality and how politics and religion seek to control it.In Pullman’s world, personhood is divided in two — the human form and an animal (ever-changing for children and fixed post-puberty). People’s “daemons” represent their sentience and sexuality, which are in some ways for all of us, inextricably linked. The villain in La Belle Sauvage, for example, is a manipulator and abuser of children. He hates his hyena-daemon and abuses and beats her mercilessly.With remarkable subtlety and skill, Pullman manages to convey the nervous excitement of receiving sexual attention from a practised predator, especially when one is ignorant of the ways of such people, and the wave of queasiness that comes when we realise what happened, what was at stake. He explores the cruelty of children, the wilderness that is adolescence without knowledge, safety and friendship and does so with honesty. Two-thirds through the book, in a moment of anger and vulnerability, Alice uses a barrage of f-words. It displays her weakness, her rage and Pullman has the sense to know that his young readers need not be shielded from that. That in the correct context, teenage readers can make sense of most things.Pullman has matured in his understanding of religion since His Dark Materials as well. He has moved from a Richard Dawkins-like dismissal of religion to a more nuanced take. While the church-state is still the villain, a priory run by kind, accepting nuns also finds pride of place in La Belle Sauvage. Pullman shows how religion is a refuge for those defeated by life, that piety need not make one conservative and controlling.',real

'CLEVELAND -- Whoever broke into an Ohio museum late Friday and stole a solid-gold replica of the Apollo 11 lunar module likely intends to melt it down for the value of the gold instead of trying to sell what could be a collectible worth millions of dollars, said a Texas attorney and retired federal agent with NASA who has helped recover and locate stolen moon rocks worth millions of dollars.The 5-inch high replica was discovered stolen after an alarm sounded just before midnight Friday at the Armstrong Air and Space Museum in Wapakoneta, the boyhood home of astronaut Neil Armstrong, the first person to set foot on the moon in July 1969.Replicas made by the French jeweler Cartier were presented to Armstrong and fellow Apollo 11 space voyagers Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins in Paris shortly after they returned to Earth.The NASA agent, Joseph Gutheinz Jr., tells The Associated Press in an interview Sunday there\'s a moon rock in the museum from the Apollo 11 mission that\'s much larger than other rocks given away or loaned to museums or foreign countries that could easily be smuggled out of the country, where a geologist could verity its authenticity. He said it would be worth millions of dollars to a collector into space items.\"Either they didn\'t have easy access to the moon rock, or they weren\'t into collectibles,\" Gutheinz said of the thief or thieves. \"They were into turning a quick buck.\"Gutheinz ran an undercover sting operation in 1998 that led to the recovery of a moon rock from the Apollo 17 mission originally given to the Honduran government. The seller offered the rock to Gutheinz for $5 million. He more recently has led a group of criminal justice students from the University Phoenix in a project that has identified 79 missing lunar samples and rocks from the Apollo 11 and Apollo 17 missions.At an auction of space items on July 20 at Sotheby\'s in New York a lunar collection bag Armstrong carried on the moon sold for $1.8 million, a value enhanced by tiny amounts of moon dust engrained in the bag.It will be difficult to catch the thief if the replica is melted down, which Gutheinz said would be a \"damn shame.\" It\'s unclear how much gold the replica contains.The FBI and Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation are assisting Wapakoneta police in the theft investigation. Police have said they aren\'t able to place a value on the replica lunar module. No updates on the investigation have been released and authorities haven\'t said whether there were surveillance cameras in or around the museum that might have recorded the theft.Armstrong died in 2012 at the age of 82.',real
'Book- Barefoot to boots: The many lives of Indian football\r\nAuthor- Novy Kapadia\r\nPublisher- Penguin\r\nPages- 345 \r\nPrice- 399Hyderabad has unearthed some of Indian football’s biggest superstars. But its contribution goes way beyond the football field. If not for a local team from the city, Delhi’s most famous eating joint might never have been discovered.Football expert Novy Kapadia’s latest book, Barefoot to boots: Many Lives of Indian Football, is an eye-opener is many ways. But it also surprises you with tales beyond the football pitch, underlining the cultural influence the sport had before it went into a freefall.Back in the day, Karim’s was just another restaurant in Old Delhi that served Mughlai food and provided cheap, basic accommodation for those who couldn’t afford a more luxurious stay in the capital — until it was made famous by Hyderabad City Police, the erstwhile heavyweights of Indian football.Since 1950, when they were in Delhi for the Durand Cup, the team’s players stayed at the Karim Hotel due to its proximity to the Jama Masjid. The fans flocked to interact with their heroes and while waiting for them, they would order food from the restaurant. “The reputation of its mouth-watering dishes spread far and wide by word of mouth… Creditably, the owners of Karim Hotel acknowledge the role played by the Hyderabad City Police football team in popularising their restaurant,” Kapadia writes, adding that the former players of the team get 50 per cent discount even today.As former India captain Baichung Bhutia says in his foreword, Kapadia is “the grand old man of Indian football”. As a fan, journalist and commentator, he has followed the sport for close to 60 years, writing for multiple newspapers and appearing on television channels as an expert. He belongs to the rare breed of followers who can remember the right back from India’s 1962 Asian Games squad and even the wingers from Bengaluru FC’s AFC Cup final last year.Kapadia has experienced first-hand the heady days of the country’s dominance in Asia to the current dismal state where they struggle to qualify for the continental championships. But this book isn’t a rant. Instead, it transports you back to a time in Indian football where the players were treasured and there was genuine passion for the local game. It drips with nostalgia, reminiscing about famous players, matches and tournaments but also takes a pragmatic look at the current state of affairs.My first meeting with Kapadia was on the upper tier of the Ambedkar Stadium where he sat under the harsh summer sun commentating on an under-16 boy’s match. Even today, Ambedkar — earlier called the Delhi Gate Stadium — has an old-world charm to it, which Kapadia beautifully captures in his chapter on the capital, once the hub of national football.Kapadia recalls the celebrations that followed City Club’s remarkable victory over Indian Nationals in the Old Delhi derby of July 1964. City Club’s main man, Aziz Qureishi, “was given free glasses of milk by happy supporters for the rest of the year; for a fortnight after the match the team was invited for sumptuous daawats by delirious fans.”There are personal stories of Kapadia attending Mohun Bagan’s Durand Cup quarterfinal against Bangalore’s Chief of Inspectorate Lines in 1965, hours after the death of his grandmother. Kapadia snuck out without informing anyone, but when the family got to know he had skipped the funeral for the match, his father, uncle and even the priest were curious to know if Bagan had won.Through the 345 pages, Kapadia marvels and mourns the rise and fall of the sport in traditional pockets such as Goa and Kerala through a series of anecdotes. But at the same time, this isn’t just a recollection about the good old days.Indian football is going through an identity crisis like never before. The brash, in-your-face Indian Super League (ISL) has shaken the old, established order and created what AIFF president Praful Patel called a “disruption” that has left the country without a proper domestic league.The ISL, de facto first division, kicked off on Friday without East Bengal and Mohun Bagan, who will continue to play in the I-League, the federation-organised league that is kicked into oblivion. Kapadia warns it would be “a catastrophe if these two clubs and therefore this derby match declines…Indian football with a downgraded or non-existent East Bengal or Mohun Bagan would be like Agra without the Taj Mahal.”Such warnings, alas, have fallen on deaf ears. In the last few years, hundreds of players lost employment as the clubs stopped competing in major tournaments such as the Durand Cup while the once-glamorous Santosh Trophy has lost its relevance. And, even though the national team is steadily rising in international rankings, India’s dream to reclaim its lost continental glory remains just that — a dream.',real

The chip on his shoulder is so huge that the smallest criticism of Hinduism, Hindus or Hindustan sends him (and her) into an apoplectic fit, especially on Twitter. The rage vented is so petty, putrid and pathetic that I believe that instead of being the proud patriots these chippy Indians profess to be, they are secretly ashamed of being Indian. I find myself permanently at war with these ‘Hindu nationalists’, so I warn you in advance that I absolutely refuse to be counted among them when you finish reading this piece.I belong to an older, more confident genre of Indians. We never needed to wear nationalism or faith as shining cloaks of our identity because we knew who we were and were proud of it. The India I grew up in had more Indians of my kind than of the new kind, and rarely did they become enraged by what foreign newspapers wrote about India. On a personal level, I discovered from more than a decade of writing for a foreign newspaper that the levels of ignorance among my British colleagues were so deep, there was no point in arguing with them. The India they were interested in belonged in books they may have read in school…snake charmers, starving millions, Mowgli and tigers.So I could sell them a story on the Dom Raja of Benares any time, but when I suggested that I go to Ayodhya, when the forces of Hindutva gathered there to tear down the Babri Masjid, the foreign editor did not think it was an important story. Another example of dazzling ignorance was when he insisted that it was impossible for ‘someone as good looking as Rajiv Gandhi to lose the election (in 1989) to a funny little man in a funny cap’. I tried to explain that looks mattered less in India than in sophisticated western democracies but it was useless.So I learned long ago that the people who wrote about India in foreign newspapers were nearly all too ignorant to argue with. This week if I take issue with the absurd New York Times article on Hindutva and the sari, it is because the article seems to have been written by an Indian and because this newspaper is too important to ignore. I take issue also because nearly every political story I have read in the The New York Times in recent years has been based on prejudice and ignorance. Anyone who can write, as the writer did last week in ‘Politics, India style’, that Har Har Mahadev means everyone is Lord Shiva, needs to never write another word about India as long as he lives. But, it is exactly this kind of ignorance that finds its way into almost any political article that The New York Times publishes on India.At the risk of sounding a little like a chippy, Hindutva type, I have to point out that there has been much more ignorance and prejudice about India evident in The New York Times since Narendra Modi became prime minister. The best example of this prejudice is that he is often made to sound as if he were the only chief minister who presided over communal riots in which the victims were mostly Muslim. In older times, it was hard to remember the exact number of times in which horrible riots have occurred in India since 1947. Now all you need is Google to get a detailed list, and yet this myth continues to be perpetuated by a newspaper that is today possibly the most important in the world.',real

'A group of firefighters in the U.K. saved a group of piglets from a large barn fire and were rewarded with sausages made from the rescued swine.BBC News reports 18 piglets and two sows were saved from a farm in Wiltshire in February after 60 tons of hay caught fire. Firefighters from the Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service battled the blaze, which was started by an electrical issue.The piglets were given a brief stay of execution but met their inevitable fate six months after the fire. Rachel Rivers, the manager of the farm, told BBC News the pigs were slaughtered and turned into sausages, which were delivered to the firefighters.\"I\'m sure vegetarians will hate this,\" Rivers said.The firefighters barbecued the sausages at the Pewsey fire station, calling them \"fantastic.\" The firefighters posted images of the barbecue to their Facebook page, which have since been taken down.Rivers defended the gesture, saying the move \"was a good way of saying, \'Thank you.\'\"\"I gave those animals the best quality of life I could ever give until the time they go to slaughter and they go into the food chain,\" she said. \"You do feel sad at the end of it.\"A spokesman for the fire service thanked Rivers \"for her generosity\" in comments to BBC News, saying the sausages were \"highly recommended.\"\"We can tell no porkies, the sausages were fantastic,\" the spokesman said Tuesday.A spokeswoman for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) criticized the incident, telling BBC News the piglets were \"no better off\" for having been rescued from the February fire.\"We\'ll be sending Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service packs of vegan sausages so that they can see how easy it is to truly be heroes for pigs -- by sparing them all suffering,\" PETA\'s Mimi Bekhechi said.',real
'Last Updated Jun 12, 2017 8:48 PM EDTRENDON, Texas -- Firefighters who tried to save a Texas home that was struck by lightning ran out of the one thing they really needed: water, CBS Dallas/Fort Worth reports.After lightning struck the peak of a two-story home in Rendon on Friday morning, flames raced through through the attic.Firefighters realized the 3,000 gallons of water they brought with them wasn\'t enough. They turned to the closest hydrant -- somewhat surprised to see one in the area -- and got close to nothing. The water pressure was less than 10 psi, which is not nearly enough to stop a fire.\"With all these hose, we actually, what we tried to do was set up a fire truck there and boost the pressure,\" said Captain Steve Gutierrez, with the Rendon Fire Department. \"But there wasn\'t even enough water. We would have actually pulled the hydrant out of the ground.\"A tanker was eventually sent to another fire hydrant, and it shuttled water back to engines at the scene.Texas health and safety codes set a standard for hydrants to provide a minimum of 250 gallons of water per minute for two hours. They\'re supposed to have at least 20 pounds of pressure per square inch.But the hydrant near the burning home was installed with a four-inch water main, which is used for flushing lines rather than firefighting.No injuries were reported.The cause of the fire remains under investigation.',real
'FERNANDINA BEACH, Fla. -- A message in a bottle that sat dormant for more than three decades in Florida has connected two strangers.WXIA-TV reports Ryan Burchett found the brown glass bottle while he was fishing on Little St. Simons with friends and family. The group was walking along the shoreline, looking for seashells, when Burchett spotted the bottle.\"I knew it looked a little different,\" Burchett told WXIA-V. \"When I held it up to the sun, I could see a note inside.\"He proceeded to open the top of the bottle, but the swing top separated from the cork and fell apart. The note remained trapped inside the glass, but eventually, Burchett was able to wrap the handwritten letter around a stick and pull it out.The message read: \"This bottle was set adrift off Fernandina Beach, Florida on the 10th of June, 1981. To the finder, I would appreciate it if you would respond as to where, when and found by whom. My permanent address is as follows on the back. Thanks, Douglas H. Stephens.\"Burchett was determined to follow through with Stephens\' request. He traced the address back to Chamblee, Georgia, but there was one problem -- public records showed the property had been bought and sold several times since the letter was written.Burchett was unable to look for Stephens on social media because he does not use Facebook. So instead, Southeast Adventure Outfitters posted a note to their Facebook page on Burchett\'s behalf.The post received more than 1,500 shares and hundreds of comments and tags. But Stephens didn\'t see the message since he is not on Facebook either.Eventually, Stephens was put in touch with Burchett by phone. The men talked for quite some time, sharing stories about the island where Stephens had vacationed growing up.The men say they plan to meet up in person later this summer.',real
'SANIBEL ISLAND, Fla. -- Several fishermen recently reeled in a 12-foot hammerhead shark on the shoreline of a beach in Florida, CBS Miami reports.Joe Pope and his friends caught the shark just 100 yards from the beach in Sanibel Island on Friday night.\"Something just nailed one of our baits. As soon as we set into it, we just knew it was something huge,\" Pope said. \"It\'s a fish of a lifetime when you get something like that.\"Beachgoers were stunned after learning that such a large shark was caught so close to shore. They said they were nervous about going into the water.\"I may go out up to my knees tomorrow, that\'s it,\" said Jen Elkins.Experts say more people in the water at Florida beaches is a recipe for increased contacts with sharks.Researchers documented 35 shark attacks in Florida in 2016. The state of Florida has more shark attacks in recorded history than all other states combined.\"They\'re out in the water already. People forget it, you could see from the sky, they\'re swimming around you,\" shark angler Richard Jones said.Since it is illegal to keep a hammerhead shark, Pope immediately released it after snapping a few photos.',real
'Last Updated Jun 15, 2017 8:09 PM EDTFishermen catch all sorts of things from the ocean: fish, garbage, sometimes even sharks, but some Dutch fishermen weren\'t prepared for what they caught in the North Sea last month -- a two-headed porpoise.The rare creature turned out to be a set of conjoined newborn twins that shared a single body.Sadly, the small mammal was already dead when fishermen hauled it out of the chilly waters off the coast of the Netherlands. Fearing it would be illegal to keep the dead porpoise, the fishermen decided to throw it back to sea.But before they did, a fisherman snapped some photos of the surreal sight.The pictures of the odd-looking creature eventually made their way to Dr. Erwin Kompanje of the Natural History Museum Rotterdam. Kompanje has been studying dolphins, whales and porpoises for more than 20 years, but he\'s never seen anything quite like this.The two-headed creature \"is extremely rare,\" Kompanje told CBS News via email. \"Normal twins are extremely rare in cetaceans, conjoined twins even more rare.\"So rare, in fact, Kompanje said out of the 700,000 harbor porpoises in the world -- with about half of them living in the North Sea -- this was the first case of conjoined twins in the species on record.There have been only nine other cases of conjoined twinning in a cetacean species, which consists of whales, porpoises and dolphins. The most recent, in 2014, was a two-headed conjoined set of dolphins that washed ashore in western Turkey. Like the two-headed porpoise, the dolphins were also already dead upon discovery.\"Dolphins have to be able to swim, directly after birth,\" Kompanje explained. \"Conjoined twins are unable to swim with these complex anatomy.\"In one of the photos of the two-headed porpoise, researchers were able to spot an umbilical opening, which suggests the twins died shortly after birth, according to the Online Journal of the Natural History Museum Rotterdam.Some researchers are lamenting the two-headed porpoise was thrown back into the sea, because it could have provided some unique information about the creatures\' anatomy.\"As cetaceans are mammals anatomically adapted to complete life in the sea, we are curious how the anatomy in conjoined twins is,\" Kompanje said. \"Especially the development of the spinal musculature. Cetaceans have highly developed spinal musculature as they use their spinal column for movement.\"',real
'While a good education abroad works wonders for an individual’s career prospects, it also ends up burning a large hole in their pocket. It is not always easy to ask for money back home from your parents, yet the experience of living with a low supply of funds can be excruciating.In such a scenario, looking for part-time jobs can emerge as the ideal choice, as it reduces the excess burden on parents while inculcating a sense of responsibility and discipline in students and providing them with a chance to gather some unique experiences.Enlisted below are a few part-time jobs that are suitable for Indian students looking to substantiate their financial resources while simultaneously pursuing their studies:1. Canada According to the Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) department’s latest ruling, an international student is now allowed to work off-campus without a work permit if they are full-time students with a valid study permit and pursuing a course that will continue for at least six months, earning them a degree, diploma or a certificate.\r\nStudents can work as interns or research scholars in their area of academics or as servers in restaurants, consumer representatives, garage workers etc up to 20 hours per week.2. New Zealand One of the most beautiful places in the world, New Zealand has consistently ranked in the top 20 in terms of the quality of education provided in the island country. New Zealand was among the first few countries to implement a ‘code of practice’ for institutions admitting foreign students. International students on a hired visa are allowed to work part-time for up to 20 hours a week during classes and full-time on scheduled holidays. Data-entry work, translation assignments, interlocutors, attendants in super-markets, lab help are some of the popular part-time job options for students in New Zealand.3. United States of America Twenty hours per week is the cap on any on-campus part-time job undertaken by an international student. The visa guidelines specify that international students cannot work off-campus, but that should not be considered a hindrance as the campus offers plenty of options.\r\nFrom library monitors, research assistants, crèche handlers for children of the staff to peer tutors or bookstore assistants, campuses offer a variety of jobs that pay a decent wage while keeping the student near his/her place of residence.4. Australia International students are allowed to work 40 hours per fortnight on their student visa in Australia, while during semester breaks a person is allowed to work unlimited hours. Here the work is available in a variety of areas such as retail, hospitality, services, industry, it is important for students to open an Australian bank account and apply for a tax file number to ensure that they are taxed at the correct rate. This also helps and develop a propensity to save.5. The United Kingdom Indian students studying in the UK are allowed to work for up to 20 hours per week during a study-term. During vacation period, they are allowed to work full-time. However, students who are pursuing any course less than six months in duration are not allowed to work in the UK in most cases. Online portals are a very popular option for securing part-time work in the UK and most Indian and international students enlist on a variety of portals to allow them to find a job that matches their field of study.Being a restaurant staff is also a popular option as London is filled with restaurants serving Indian and a host of cuisines from multiple countries. Working in these establishments guarantees a student a free meal in the evenings apart from substantial savings.',real
'BEIJING -- Chinese airlines aren\'t exactly known for flying on time. Four of them ranked among the worst last year when it comes to on-time arrivals and departures.Not all delays are the airlines\' fault, of course. For instance, it wasn\'t China Southern airline\'s fault this week when a Guangzhou-bound flight was delayed for more than five hours at Shanghai Pudong International Airport.The culprit was a woman in her 80s, who was just trying to keep everyone safe.The woman, identified only by her last name, Qiu, is apparently a Buddhist who, like many of the faith, put a lot of stock in good luck.Another passenger saw Qiu behaving strangely around their plane as they boarded -- throwing a handful of coins straight at the jet\'s engine. She did it, it turns out, with a little prayer for good luck, hoping to bring herself and the other passengers in for a safe landing at their destination.Police have said only one of the nine coins (with a total value of about 25 cents) actually made it into the engine, but that was enough to force the airline to pull everyone off the flight while engineers ensured no damage had been done and the jet engine was clear.Chinese passengers have some history with disrupting air travel. In 2016, a Chinese woman was arrested for common assault after throwing orange juice at a flight attendant. Another flier poured hot water and threw noodles at a Thai AirAsia flight attendant.They also can\'t seem to stop opening emergency exit doors, for a variety of reasons, including simple curiosity, innocently mistaking it for the toilet, and a misguided attempt to get some fresh air.With a booming economy and a fast-growing middle class, Chinese are traveling more than even. The country\'s tourists spent more money overseas last year -- $261 billion -- than travellers from any other single nation, according to the United Nations World Tourism Organization. That represents an increase in Chinese tourism spending of 12 percent over the previous year.The problem of misbehaving, or simply inexperienced Chinese fliers who then went on to cause problems at their destinations got so bad a couple years ago that the national tourism regulator had to step in.A \"blacklist\" of offenders, those who have demonstrated illegal or inappropriate behavior abroad, was established in 2015.Banned behavior includes \"acting antisocially on public transport, disrespecting local customs, sabotaging historical exhibits or engaging in gambling or pornographic activities.\" In the two years since the domestic travel ban went into effect, 29 Chinese nationals have been blacklisted.As for Mrs. Qiu, police pulled her aside and asked some questions, but they let her go without filing any charges, and there\'s no indication she will be blacklisted for her well-intended coin toss.',real
'LAKELAND, Fla. -- A Florida man has been charged with killing an alligator and trying to sell its butchered remains, reports CBS affiliate WKMG-TV.The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said it received a report Sunday afternoon from concerned Lakeland, Florida residents, who said 33-year-old Shaun Sparks was trying to sell them an alligator tail.A licensed trapper responded and found the seven-foot alligator\'s carcass.

'LONDON -- Social media users in London are buzzing about an apparent swarm of flying insects that has descended on one part of the city.Videos posted to Twitter Tuesday show people ducking as the insects descend on Greenwich in southeast London.

'MINERAL WELLS, Texas -- For $125,000, you can be the proud owner of a three bedroom, two bathroom home that sits in the heart of Mineral Wells, Texas.But there\'s a catch -- you need to be comfortable with the idea of sharing the property with paranormal spirits. The current owner, Phil Kirchhoff, says as many as nine inhabitants call the place home.\"When we bought the house, we had no idea that it was haunted,\" Kirchhoff told CBS Dallas / Fort Worth. \"I wasn\'t involved in the paranormal [activity] at that point. The neighbors all started talking about it. They started telling us stories.\"The 2,800-square-foot home sits in the shadow of the historic Baker Hotel. It\'s about a block and a half away.Becky Foley, with Source 1 Real Estate, says this is her most unique listing to date. She herself doesn\'t delve into the paranormal activity, but confesses to witnessing some odd occurrences.\"A client got literally nauseously ill and thought she was going to pass out and ran out,\" Foley said. \"She kept saying, \'I can\'t go back in there. Something hit me the moment you opened the door. I cannot go back in there.\'\"According to Kirchhoff, that\'s not unusual. He says the \"spirits do not want some people in this house\" and \"they\'ll chase them out\" if that\'s the case.The home\'s many living spaces are furnished with relics from different eras that belonged to the people who live there. Lone toy carousels and stuffed animals eerily sit on the floorboards.At one point, the home had three bathrooms, but one room was sealed up for an unknown reason. The closed-off room comes equipped with a unique safety feature that resembles burglar bars.\"We\'ve heard it could have been a brothel,\" Foley said. \"We wonder if some of the people were maybe kept against their will, hence the bars. We don\'t know.\"Even though the home has been appraised at just over $26,000, Foley says the $125,000 price tag reflects the business opportunity that resides there.Currently, the property attracts brave souls interested in investigating paranormal activity. On weekends, groups explore the house and often share their findings with a community of enthusiasts on the Haunted Hill House\'s Facebook page. Tours are booked through September.Foley says Kirchhoff does not live at the residence, but hopes the right buyer will embrace his passion for the property.\"His hope is whoever takes it and buys it will have the love for what he loves,\" Foley said. \"I think it will make a cool bed and breakfast. We\'ll just have to see what its future holds.\"',real
'LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- A former beauty pageant winner from Kentucky has been accused of smuggling marijuana into an Ohio prison for an inmate.Media outlets report a grand jury in Allen County, Ohio, indicted 28-year-old Kia Hampton of Louisville earlier this month.Officers from the Ohio State Highway Patrol said recorded phone calls gave them enough evidence to get a warrant for a cavity search, the Courier-Journal reported, citing an affidavit.Hampton reached into her pants as officers were interrogating her, pushing a white balloon down to the floor, the affidavit said.Assistant Allen County Prosecutor Kenneth Sturgill said Hampton was carrying nearly 3 grams of marijuana into the jail, according to the Courier-Journal.The third-degree felony charge of bringing drugs onto government facility grounds carries a maximum three-year prison sentence upon conviction.Hampton was served a search warrant upon arriving at the Allen Correctional Institution on May 26 for an inmate visit.Hampton was crowned Miss Kentucky USA in 2011 and was the first black woman chosen to represent Kentucky in the Miss USA Pageant.',real
'NEW DELHI: Former prime minister Manmohan Singh will receive the Indira Gandhi Prize for Peace, Disarmament and Development this year for his leadership of the country between 2004 and 2014 and for enhancing India\'s stature globally. According to a statement from the Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust, Singh was unanimously chosen for the award by an international jury chaired by ex-president Pranab Mukherjee. \"The Indira Gandhi Prize for Peace, Disarmament and Development is awarded to Manmohan Singh for his leadership of the country and his achievements during the momentous 10 years from 2004 to 2014, for his contributions to the cause of economic and social development, for improving India\'s stature in the world and its relationship with the neighbours and the leading nations of the world, and for his dedication to the security and well being of ordinary citizens regardless of their faith, caste, region or language,\" a statement from the Trust\'s secretary Suman Dubey said. The Trust said Singh is only the third Indian prime minister to complete two full terms as the PM between 2004 and 2014. His tenure witnessed the path-breaking nuclear agreement with the US and the Copenhagen Climate Change agreement, the statement said. Singh, who as the governor of the Reserve Bank of India and the finance minister in the government headed by P V Narasimha Rao, played a pivotal role in ushering economic reforms, it said adding that as prime minister he led India in achieving the highest sustained rate of economic growth since Independence. The Trust said Singh has been responsible for making India\'s voice heard more effectively at international forums. \"The 10 years of his premiership were not only a period of rapid economic and social changes, they witnessed the lowest terrorist violence, prolonged period of communal harmony, peace on the country\'s borders and a globally acknowledged rise in India\'s standing in the global community of nations,\" the statement said. The international award named after former prime minister Indira Gandhi was instituted in 1986. The award has been announced on the eve of Gandhi\'s birth anniversary, which falls tomorrow. The last two recipients have been the Indian Space Research Organisation and the UN High Commission for Refugees.

'Moving away from old trends, young women are now opting for preservative-free products for a long-lasting glow and balanced health ahead of their wedding day. The Indian wedding sector is reportedly estimated to be around $40-50 billion in size. So, it turns out to be an important market for many brands. Sheena Jain, founder of India’s first fresh almond milk brand SAIN, says the uptrend of going organic and vegan is more likely a result of current health and wellness trends which are fast catching up with women in the age group of 18 to 40. “Weddings are huge in India and every bride wants to achieve the right balance of internal and external beauty. Pre-bridal detox is a huge trend overseas and now it’s fast catching up in India. The consumer rates back-to-basics food attributes like ‘all natural’, ‘no artificial colours or flavours’ and ‘plant-based’ as the most important,” Jain told IANS.Almond milk is one of the food items that can help people maintain natural glow as it is a good source of Vitamin E, an antioxidant which has natural skin healing properties. Chef Swasti Aggarwal, Food Strategies at Foodhall, says eating organic and vegan is a huge trend in the market and a lot of brides are doing detox diets to look good and glow on their D-day. “Veganism is great as it provides all the nutrition we need with plant sources and avoids the intake of excess fat and protein that meat gives,” Aggarwal told IANS of the diet, which excludes meat, eggs, dairy products and all other animal-derived ingredients.She said the impact is great if the diet becomes a lifestyle and people eat healthy for life.Supriya Chopra, Founder, The Salad Story, is equally excited about the trend.”I think eating healthy is a huge fad in the market and a lot of brides and their families are doing detox diets for the glow and to look the best and attractive on their big day. For instance, we offer a complete, healthy package of fresh vegetables, variety of leaves and right proteins to fulfill your intake of important vitamins and minerals,” Chopra told IANS.She also said that eating fresh and healthy is expensive, and preparation is not easy — with ingredients like balsamic vinaigrette, honey, olive oil, yogurt, feta cheese and berries. “But it’s always better to invest in right and balanced eating than spend later on some lifestyle disease,” said Chopra. Brides-to-be also have no qualms in opting for extreme vegan and organic diets for best results.',real
'ORLANDO, Fla. - What should have been a smooth landing turned scaly when a pilot at Orlando Executive Airport hit an 11-foot, 500 pound alligator that was crossing the runway, reports CBS Orlando affiliate WKMG-TV.Local pilot Brad Pierce posted a photo on Facebook Tuesday showing the lifeless reptile and explaining the information he was given about the incident.\"I was told the pilot was flying a Navajo and the gator jumped up and struck the wing during his landing. The gator was killed instantly and the aircraft sustained damage to the wing,\" Pierce wrote.Pierce\'s post has been shared more than 2,000 times.The Greater Orlando Aviation Authority said a Piper PA 31 was landing around 2:15 a.m. on Thursday when the plane fatally struck the reptile. The gator was killed on impact. The pilot wasn\'t injured but the aircraft did sustain some damage.Traffic at the airport wasn\'t impacted after the collision or when a trapper removed the animal.The last time a plane in Florida hit an alligator was in 2013 at Southwest Florida International Airport in Fort Myers, according to the Federal Aviation Authority wildlife strike database. Locally, an alligator was struck at Orlando International Airport on Sept. 12, 2012.Four total plane versus alligator collisions have been reported at OIA since 1998, the FAA says.The agency has no record of any prior alligator strikes at Orlando Executive Airport.One animal has been hit at that airport in the past year, a bird on Jan. 28, 2016.A total of 147 animals have been struck at Orlando Executive Airport since 1990, the vast majority of which were birds, including owls, hawks and one bald eagle.',real
'Last Updated Aug 10, 2017 4:08 PM EDTThough gone now, the White House has an unusual onlooker Wednesday -- a large, inflatable chicken with golden orange hair.The inflatable chicken, situated on the Ellipse facing 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, is a visual that organizers of the Tax Day March have used in the past to coax President Trump to release his tax returns. Tax Day March events in cities from D.C. to Chicago to San Francisco this year have featured the large poultry prop as they protest Mr. Trump\'s decision to break with the tradition of recent presidents to release their tax information.Mr. Trump has released some scattered information about his tax history, but nothing close to full returns. The president, however, isn\'t in town to see the bird in his backyard. He is at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, on a 17-day working vacation.The existence of the orange-haired chicken delighted the Internet on Wednesday.Then, the chicken -- or rather, someone running the chicken\'s account -- began to tweet.But there is more than one chicken -- protesters across the country have ordered them online. Ebay lists several available inflatable Trump chickens. A 10-foot chicken from China sells for $500. China is, in fact, where the chicken appears to have originated.The northern Chinese city of Taiyuan used a 23-foot statue to celebrate the Year of the Rooster, shortly before Mr. Trump\'s inauguration, the New York Times reported in December. Relations between China and the U.S. were jittery then, and haven\'t improved much since.The issue of the president\'s tax returns isn\'t likely to disappear soon. Mr. Trump and Congress intend to move forward with tax reform this fall, and the topic of the president\'s own taxes will likely resurface.',real

'Euphoric crowds of several thousand people have gathered in Zimbabwe’s capital to demand the departure of President Robert Mugabe after nearly four decades in power. In a colorful gathering that even days ago would have drawn an immediate police crackdown, Zimbabweans giddy with joy raced through intersections, raising their arms in triumph. Young men shouted, laughed and embraced.Some had posters with an image of the military commander who swept in earlier this week and put Mugabe under house arrest, with the slogan: “Go, go, our general!!!” Marchers handed flags to soldiers, who accepted and waved.“It’s like Christmas,” said one marcher, Fred Mubay, who said Zimbabweans have been suffering for a long time.The 93-year-old Mugabe, the world’s oldest head of state, is said to be asking for more time amid negotiations with regional leaders that seek his exit with a veneer of dignity.But he is virtually powerless and deserted by most of his allies, with others arrested, and the crowds in Harare on Saturday were making it clear the country was impatient to move on without him.Even as concerns remained about who next would be in charge and what freedoms might be available if the military lingered in power _ or if Mugabe’s longtime but recently fired deputy led a new government _ people reveled in the rare chance to speak out.The demonstrators, in the event approved by the military, hope a big turnout will speed up the official end of Mugabe’s rule, which is widely blamed for the collapse of an economy that was once one of Africa’s wealthiest.Veterans of the long liberation war against white minority rule, once close allies of Mugabe, took part, along with opposition activists who have faced police crackdowns by the Mugabe government.At an intersection, a vendor held up a newspaper with the headline: “Mugabe cornered.”One driver was so jubilant that he got out of his moving car and danced in front of it for a couple of minutes as the empty vehicle coasted slowly down a street lined with cheering crowds.Some white Zimbabweans joined the crowd at Harare’s Freedom Square, also known as Robert Mugabe Square. Some whites and blacks hugged each other.Soldiers began approaching the demonstrators and urging them to head to the Zimbabwe Grounds, where speeches were set to be delivered.The Zimbabwe Grounds were chosen for the symbolism. The location is where Zimbabweans gathered to cheer Mugabe’s return from exile in 1980 after the liberation war from white minority rule.Now the crowds wish to meet there and urge Mugabe’s departure.The 37-year-old Talent Mudzamiri was born soon after Zimbabwe’s independence.“It’s like a relief,” he said. “Our voices have not been heard for a long time. The trend in Africa, when the people speak, they are not heard.”',real

We thought that we could give them the funeral they deserved one day.\"Udry-Dumoulin is the youngest of seven children born to Marcelin and Francine Dumoulin. The couple went to milk their cows on a meadow above their home in Switzerland\'s Valais canton on August 15, 1942, according to the Reuters news agency, and never came home.Local rescue teams had spent more than two months searching crevasses before giving up, The Associated Press reports.The regional police force told local media the bodies were discovered last week, near a ski lift on the Tsanfleuron glacier, by a worker for an adventure resort company.\"The bodies were lying near each other. It was a man and a woman wearing clothing dating from the period of World War Two,\" Glacier 3000 director Bernhard Tschannen told local media, according to Reuters. \"They were perfectly preserved in the glacier and their belongings were intact.\"Tschannen told the Tribune de Geneve that his staff believed the couple likely fell into a crevasse, \"where they stayed for decades.

'NEW DELHI: The government is considering offering a \"rolling contract\" for road development that will see toll collection end ahead of the contracted period if the investment and profit has been recovered, in order to blunt criticism that surfaced over Delhi-Noida-Direct (DND) flyway and Delhi-Gurgaon projects. Conversely, the contract period may be extended if the contractor, due to certain circumstances, is unable to recover expected dues. Though the proposal offers some succour to contractors, NHAI will reserve the right to take over the project to stem public opposition over \"super profits\". The ministry had a detailed discussion on this model-variable build operate and transfer (V-BOT)-on Saturday. Cases like that of DND and other highway projects where contractors are a llowed to collect toll for years have prompted the government to explore this new public-private partnership (PPP) model for road construction. There have been several instances of protests in states including Delhi, UP and Maharashtra against the existing practice. Even a parliamentary committee had pointed out this flaw while examining the contract period and total toll collection on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway. \"The real-time toll collection in each project rolled out under V-BOT will be verified using the electronic toll collection data and other IT-enabled assessments, the parametes of which will be defined clearly,\" said a ministry official. Under this model, the projects will be bid out on the basis of total cost (including construction, financing, operation and maintenance) for a defined contract period. The lowest bidder will get the project and will build, operate and collect toll. \"If toll collection increases beyond the projection due to high traffic growth, the contractor will recover the cost before the quoted period and NHAI will terminate the contract. NHAI will then collect toll to recover the land cost. When that amount is recovered, toll will be slashed by 40\%,\" another official said. All such projects will compulsorily have 100\% electronic toll collection, installation of automatic traffic count and classifier system, video image detection and other systems. The model has been conceptualised to address all the risk factors, another official said.

'CANBERRA, Australia -- A 73-year-old Australian fisherman said Monday that he caught a far bigger fish than he hoped for when a 9-foot great white shark leapt into his boat, knocking him off his feet.Terry Selwood was left with a badly bruised and bleeding right arm where the airborne shark struck him with a pectoral fin as it landed on him on the deck of the 15-foot power boat Saturday off Evans Head, 450 miles north of Sydney.Selwood sprung up on the gunnel at the bow of the boat to avoid the thrashing shark and steadied himself by clinging to the tubular metal frame of the sun shelter, known as a bimini.\"I didn\'t give it a chance to look me in the eyes. I wanted to get up and get on top of the gunnel because it was thrashing around madly,\" Selwood told Australian Broadcasting Corp.\"Flash Gordon wouldn\'t have caught me,\" he said, referring to the athletic science fiction comic book hero of the 1930s.Selwood used a hand-held radio to call the Evans Head coast guard and stayed on the gunnel until a rescue boat arrived.Coast guard skipper Bill Bates said he misread the danger when Selwood reported his predicament.\"He said, \'I\'m injured, I\'ve broken my arm, I\'ve got lacerations and there\'s a shark in my boat,\'\" Bates said.\"Often a fisherman will bring a small shark on board - maybe 2 or 3 feet - and they\'re still ferocious. That\'s what I was expecting, but I was totally wrong,\" he added.The coast guard crew rescued Selwood, but left the shark alone.\"We offloaded the owner into our boat and gave him immediate first aid and stabilized the bleeding,\" Bates told the BBC.The shark was estimated to weigh 440 pounds.\"The shark was thrashing inside the boat, taking up the entire deck area - there was no way you\'d put a foot in there,\" Bates said.The coast guard took Selwood to paramedics at Evans Head, where his badly swollen arm was cleared of any fracture.The coast guard later towed Selwood\'s boat with the shark into Evans Head just before nightfall.\"We think it was already dead at that stage, but no one was game to put their finger in to find out,\" Bates said.Why the shark flung itself over the motor and into the anchored boat is a mystery.Selwood said he was sitting on a cooler, known generically in Australia by the popular brand name Esky, with two hand lines off the port and starboard sides of the boat when he saw one of the lines move as if a fish was hooked.\"I hopped up off the Esky, I touched the hand line and I just caught a blur coming in the corner of me eye and just out of instinct,\" Selwood said. \"I threw me right arm up and this thing hit me in the forearm and spun me around and knocked me off me feet.\"\"This thing was beside me and I looked over and thought, \'Oh, a bloody shark.\' So I just climbed -- he was doing a mad dance around, he was thrashing everywhere,\" he added.Selwood said he\'ll have to replace destroyed equipment, including buckets and coolers, before returning to the fishing spot he\'s visited for more than 50 years.\"He didn\'t do anything structural to me boat, it just smashed anything that was in his road.

'NEW DELHI: With the Goods and Services Tax in place, 20 judges from 12 high courts brainstormed with experts and top government officials on identifying grey areas in the new regime that may throw up litigations in coming days. Top domain experts and officials from the GST Intelligence and the Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC) briefed judges about the new tax system recently, according to documents available in the public domain. The deliberations took place at a recent national judicial conference for high court judges on the GST regime organised by the Bhopal-based National Judicial Academy. Topics ranging from \'potential areas of conflict and litigation under GST\' to \'comparative analysis of concepts: GST vis-a-vis Central Excise, Service Tax and VAT\', were discussed. The conference assumes significance as litigations have already started surfacing before various courts. During the 3-day exercise, judges from Allahabad, Andhra Pradesh, Bombay, Calcutta, Delhi, Gujarat, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh and Madras high courts interacted with nine resource persons on various issues related to the GST set-up. The resources persons included officials from GST Intelligence and CBEC drawn from across India, according to the documents. A senior law ministry official said the Academy had discussed the GST issue in one of its programmes in 2015. \"The academy had been sensitising judiciary about the new tax regime,\" he said. Last week, the Delhi High Court had asked the Centre that if bindi, sindoor and kajal are kept out of the ambit of the GST, why cannot the sanitary napkin, which is an essential item, be exempted. A bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar said sanitary napkins are a necessity and there cannot be any explanation for taxing them and exempting other items by bringing them in the category of necessity. The court expressed unhappiness over absence of any women in the 31-member GST council. The court was hearing a petition challenging the levying of 12 per cent GST on sanitary napkins. The plea has termed it illegal and unconstitutional. The central government standing counsel Sanjeev Narula said that if they will exempt sanitary napkins from tax, the cost of the product will go up.

'Storming into a huge gathering at Mansa, in Gandhinagar district, Patidar quota agitation leader Hardik Patel on Saturday evening took the attack to the ruling BJP, blaming the party of trying to weaken the Patidar agitation. Mansa is the hometown of BJP president Amit Shah.On Saturday, Patel was first given permission to hold a meeting, and then denied it. The district authorities eventually allowed him to hold the meeting. Daring the ruling party, Hardik said, “You want to fight us (Patidar movement)? Then there are two ways: fight us legally, or if you want to do goondagardi, we are ready for that, too.”“We need to write on our foreheads, hun Gujarati pan murkh chu (I am a Gujarati but I am a fool),” he said, mocking the BJP campaign slogan “hu chhu vikas hun chhu Gujarat (I am vikas, I am Gujarat)”. While the BJP Saturday announced that three more members of Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) have joined the party, including Ketan Patel, who had turned approver in the case against Hardik, the PAAS convenor said, “What do you mean, saying PAAS members have joined the BJP? Bhai, is the election between the BJP and Congress, or between BJP and PAAS?”While Hardik told the crowd that if the BJP wins “it will mean 6 crore people (of Gujarat) are defeated”, he did not once ask people to help, or vote for, the Congress. Once elected, he alleged, MLAs either get government plots in state capital Gandhinagar or sell themselves for crores against casting their votes.Calling it a fight for “self-respect”, Hardik, referring to the recent video that surfaced online, purportedly showing him with a woman in a hotel room, said, “Gujarat’s people want to see CDs of vikas (development), not of a young boy..

'THE BJP’s first list of 70 candidates, including 42 constituencies that to go to the polls in the first phase on December 9, has Congress turncoats, rebels, and repeats most ministers, MLAs and candidates of 2012.

Sanghani was involved in alleged irregularities in awarding fishing contracts in the state and was defeated by Paresh Dhanani from Amreli. He will contest the December 9 polls from Dhari seat in Amreli district, overlooking sitting MLA Nalin Kotadiya.Kotadiya, who had won the 2012 polls from Dhari on a Gujarat Parivartan Party (GPP) ticket, had joined the BJP after GPP merged with the ruling party later. The MLA had openly supported the Patidar agitation and exhorted the community to defeat BJP in the 2015 local body elections. Later, he toed the BJP line. On Friday, Kotadiya released a video statement saying he had decided not to contest the Assembly election this year, and that he had not sought ticket for any seat.Twenty-eight candidates were announced for the second phase of polling on December 14, even as severe infighting surfaced as soon as the list was made public on Friday. The party gave tickets to all five opposition MLAs who joined the BJP in the run-up to the high-pitch Rajya Sabha elections in August — five of the Congress and one from JD(U). Senior leaders, the five hold influence in their respective constituencies.The BJP also announced candidates for the districts of Patan and Banaskantha, which were severely affected by floods in July. They go to the polls in the second phase.Of nine seats in Banaskantha, BJP had won three in 2012; the remaining six are with the Congress.

Although leaders express confidence, the decision to repeat almost all MLAs indicates the party does not want to “waste time” in placating those who would be disgruntled at being dropped. Both Narendra Modi, when he was the Gujarat chief minister, and party president Amit Shah have dropped dozens of sitting MLAs in order to counter the anti-incumbency factor.Shah, in fact, had faced criticism of aspirants and ire of their supporters, who demonstrated on the streets, in the run-up to the Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls.

'AHMEDABAD: It was a rollercoaster Sunday with Congress and PAAS reaching an agreement on quota and seat sharing only to see it hit a last-minute hurdle late in the night after the main opposition party announced its first list of 77 candidates, including two PAAS leaders. PAAS and Congress workers clashed near the office of Praful Togadia, Congress candidate from Patel-dominated Varchcha Road seat in Surat. PAAS members said that they had been ignored in ticket distribution+ . Dharmik Malaviya, Surat PAAS convener, said they would not allow the city Congress office to operate unless PAAS got a proper share in seat sharing. Clashes were also reported from Surat ans elsewhere. \"Congress announced tickets to PAAS members without consulting our core committee. We will register a strong protest by attacking Congress offices,\" said Dinesh Bambhania, co-convener of PAAS, who was nominated as chief negotiator of quota talks by Hardik Patel+ . Earlier, PAAS had agreed to contest five seats. The first list declared by Congress on Sunday night included two PAAS leaders - Lalit Vasoya from Dhoraji in Rajkot and Amit Thummar from Junagadh. Following a \"positive and cordial meeting\", quota warrior Hardik Patel was nominated by both PAAS and Congress to officially announce the alliance, including the nitty-gritties of the complex \'quota formula\' on Monday in Rajkot - the day when CM Vijay Rupani files his nomination papers from here. However a late night report said that Hardik Patel\'s programme at Gondal near Rajkot has been cancelled. Hardik could not be reached for a comment on whether he will officially announce the alliance given the widespread protests erupted within PAAS over seatsharing. Sources said PAAS scaled down its demand of seven to nine seats after hard bargaining by Congress following Hardik\'s alleged sextapes scandal. The development is considered significant ahead of polls as the alliance could allow Congress to tap into the resentment of Patidars whipped up by PAAS against BJP. Patidars constitute 14\% of Gujarat population. Bharatsinh Solanki, state Congress president, said, \"All issues raised by PAAS have been resolved.\" Both Congress and PAAS denied that Patel quota leaders had demanded tickets from the party. Senior Congress leader Siddharth Patel, who headed the quota talks however said, \"There was no demand for tickets. However, good candidates from the Patidar outfit will be fielded.\" Read this story in Gujarati Bambhania, who, on Friday night, had issued a 24-hour ultimatum to Congress to \'decide on quota or face protests by Patidars\', said, \"Congress has assured us a constitutionally tenable quota and an agreement has been reached over all major issues.\" Bhambania refused to disclose the details of the \'quota formula\' suggested by Congress, reiterating it will be \'exclusive from the existing reservation system for SC, ST and OBC\'. \"Congress has assured to provide 6\% quota for all nonreserved categories, including Patidars,\" a PAAS leader said.

'AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat Congress and Hardik Patel led-Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) on Sunday said that they have reached an agreement over the issue of granting reservation to Patels, if the Congress is voted to power in the state Assembly election. \"Earlier, we had asked the Congress to clarify how they would grant Patidars a constitutionally valid reservation. Today, we held a crucial meeting on that issue and finally reached a consensus on various options offered by the party to us. Official announcement of this agreement will be made by Hardik tomorrow in Rajkot,\" said Bambhania, a key aide of Hardik Patel. \"I can say that we are in agreement with the Congress about their formula of granting reservation. We have not talked about giving tickets to PAAS. Hardik would announce tomorrow whether PAAS would support the Congress during the polls or not,\" he told reporters after the crucial meeting on the issue. Hardik Patel did not attend the meeting. The meeting with PAAS leaders was attended by Gujarat Congress chief Bharatsinh Solanki and senior Congress leaders Siddharth Patel and Babubhai Mangukia. Solanki claimed the meeting yielded a \"positive outcome\". \"The meeting was successful and yielded a positive outcome. We both agreed to implement this agreement in coming days,\" he said. A week ago PAAS leaders and senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal held a meeting over the issue, following which, Hardik Patel had said he was satisfied with the three options submitted by the Congress on how the party would grant reservation to Patels if voted to power. Hardik Patel had earlier set a condition that he would support the Congress in the Assembly polls, due next month, only if the party committed to reservation in education and government jobs for his community. The polling for the two-phase elections in Gujarat will take place on December 9 and 14 and votes will be counted on December 18.

'AHMEDABAD: The Congress conceded the demand of Hardik Patel-led Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) and replaced two candidates to end the logjam with the quota warrior. In all, three PAAS nominees found their way into the Congress list Congress-PAAS talks had hit a roadblock late on Sunday, reportedly due to the exclusion of Surat diamantaire and BJP rebel Dhiru Gajera from the first list of 77 candidates announced by the chief opposition party. Cornered by protests from PAAS, the Congress on Monday replaced Praful Togadia with Gajera from the Patel-dominated Varchcha constituency of the diamond city. The other two PAAS nominees on the Congress list were Saurastra convener Lalit Vasoya from Dhoraji and Ashok Jirawala from Kamrej. Congress had earlier fielded Nilesh Kumbani from Kamrej seat in Surat. All through Monday, both Congress and PAAS leaders maintained a studied silence even as PAAS leader Hardik Patel remained largely incommunicado but for his emotional tweets urging his aides to remain united at least out of respect for Patel \'martyrs\'. Sources said PAAS pressed hard for the inclusion of Gajera, who has been supporting the quota stir. Gajera is the younger brother of Vasant Gajera, one of the trustees of Khodaldham in Rajkot\'s Kagvad -- an influential and revered religious center of Leuva Patidars. Congress, however, gave the mandate to Praful \'Pappan\' Togadia, nephew of VHP leader Pravin Togadia, who has a long association with Congress. This triggered turbulence among PAAS\", said top PAAS and Congress sources. Late on Sunday night, Patidar leaders had come to blows with Congress workers in Surat, while a furious co-convener of PAAS, Dinesh Bhambania, knocked on Gujarat Congress chief Bharatsinh Solanki\'s house in vain. Finally, Congress agreed to renominate candidates on some seats including Varachcha, even as its list of remaining 12 candidates for the first phase of polls on December 9 was awaited, to buy peace with PAAS. Congress, however, knocked out another PAAS leader, Amit Thummar, who was earlier given the ticket from Junagadh, to be replaced by Bhikhabhai Joshi. On being quizzed if there could be changes in the first list of 77 candidates declared earlier, Gujarat Congress chief Bharatsinh Solanki said, \"The talks have concluded on a positive note.\" Earlier, there was a buzz that the Congress may give telephonic mandate to candidates in order to avoid dissidence. Congress had, in 2012, given telephonic mandate to seven candidates to file nomination on disputed seats a few hours before filing nomination was to end in order to avoid ruckus by dissidents. Gajera, a former BJP MLA who had unsuccessfully contested polls from Varachcha in 2007 as an independent and later in 2012 as a Congress candidate confirmed he wished to fight. \"I can win from any seat including Katargam and Varaccha. I have heard that the party is revising its list to include my name,\" Gajera had told TOI earlier in the day. Dharmik Malviya, Surat PAAS Convener, who had come to blows with Congress workers on Sunday night said, \"Dhirubhai is the best candidate for the Varachha seat as he has a huge following. So we wanted the Congress to replace Togadia with him.\" Also, Nilesh Kumbani was replaced by textile trader and PAAS supporter Ashok Jirawla. \"Both Gajera and Jirawala were continuously supporting our quota movement as they also have a huge public support in the respective areas,\" said Malviya.

However, by late Friday evening, PAAS leaders gave a 24-hour ultimatum to Congress for a final decision on the quota formula or face statewide protests. \"We have put forward our demand for nine tickets from Congress, especially in Patidar-dominated areas in Ahmedabad, north Gujarat and Saurashtra.

'Even as talks between the Congress and Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) to work out a quota formula remained inconclusive, four Congress municipal councillors from Surat, who come from the Patidar community, on Saturday announced that they would go with PAAS’s decision on whether to support the Congress in the elections.

'Haiti’s president on Saturday heralded the re-establishment of the country’s military after 22 years, a divisive issue in the impoverished Caribbean nation which has a history of bloody coups and political instability.Haiti has been without military forces since 1995, when former president Jean-Bertrand Aristide disbanded the army after returning to power following a coup, leaving the national police responsible for security.The army’s comeback has been a divisive topic in a country still suffering from a catastrophic earthquake and a fierce hurricane in recent years, with critics and activists concerned that armed forces would meddle in politics and rob essential resources from education and health care.Haitian President Jovenel Moise on Thursday named former army colonel Jodel Lesage as acting commander-in-chief, moving troops closer to full operation. The appointment still needs to be approved by Haiti’s senate.On Saturday, Moise welcomed the army’s anticipated return with a parade featuring dozens of camouflaged soldiers toting rifles in the northern coastal city of Cap-Haitien, calling on Haitians to recall the Battle of Vertieres won against French colonialists exactly 214 years ago.“The army is our mother,” he said. “When your mother is sick and wears dirty clothes, you do not kill her. You take her to the hospital. So let us join forces to provide needed care to our mother.”After Haiti’s independence, the military mounted dozens of coups and its forces were accused of rampant human rights abuses.Moise acknowledged that history, but vowed that the new military would be different.The United Nations has called for increased support for the Haitian National Police (HNP) with about 15,000 members.A U.N.-backed mission to aid Haiti’s justice system and law enforcement arrived in October, replacing a much larger peacekeeping mission that had focused on stability efforts since 2004.“Having demonstrated its ability to maintain stability and guard against security threats, the HNP has emerged as one of the most trusted governmental institutions in Haiti,” U.N. spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement last month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\tif(typeof(jQuery)==\"function\"){(function($){$.fn.fitVids=function(){}})(jQuery)};\r\n\t\t\t\tjwplayer(\'jwplayer_kCkuXbQJ_75WCcFmf_div\').setup(\r\n\t\t\t\t{\"playlist\":\"http:\\/\\/vidshare.indianexpress.com\\/jw6\\/kCkuXbQJ.xml\"}\r\n\t\t\t);\r\n\t\t\r\nHaitian defense minister Herve Denis told Reuters the army will begin with 500 soldiers in engineering, medical and aviation corps, but is still working to fill its ranks.A recruiting process was well underway by last July, attracting many young men in a country that is the poorest in the Americas.Denis said the government plans to ultimately expand to 5,000 troops working to protect Haitian borders, fight terrorism, curb ilegal trade and aid Haitians affected by natural disasters.Government opponents fear the Moise administration could use the military to crack down on foes despite the president’s claims that troops will steer clear of politics.',real

'BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- In a hidden room in a house near Argentina\'s capital, police believe they have found the biggest collection of Nazi artifacts in the country\'s history, including a bust relief of Adolf Hitler, magnifying glasses inside elegant boxes with swastikas and even a macabre medical device used to measure head size.Some 75 objects were found in a collector\'s home in Beccar, a suburb north of Buenos Aires, and authorities say they suspect they are originals that belonged to high-ranking Nazis in Germany during World War II.\"Our first investigations indicate that these are original pieces,\" Argentine Security Minister Patricia Bullrich told The Associated Press on Monday, saying that many pieces were accompanied by old photographs. \"This is a way to commercialize them, showing that they were used by the horror, by the Fuhrer. There are photos of him with the objects.\"Among the disturbing items were toys that Bullrich said would have been used to indoctrinate children and a statue of the Nazi Eagle above a swastika.Police are trying to determine how the artifacts entered Argentina and came to be in the room hidden behind a library in the house, she said. The raid that found them was carried out on June 8.The main hypothesis among investigators and member of Argentina\'s Jewish community is that they were brought to Argentina by a high-ranking Nazi or Nazis after World War II, when the South American country became a refuge for fleeing war criminals, including some of the best known.As leading members of Hitler\'s Third Reich were put on trial for war crimes, Josef Mengele fled to Argentina and lived in Buenos Aires for a decade. He moved to Paraguay after Israeli Mossad agents captured Holocaust mastermind Adolf Eichmann, who was also living in Buenos Aires. Mengele later died in Brazil in 1979 while swimming in a beach in the town of Bertioga.While police in Argentina did not name any high-ranking Nazis to whom the objects might have originally belonged, Bullrich noted there were medical devices.\"There are objects to measure heads that was the logic of the Aryan race,\" she said.',real
'Independent India’s first voter, Shyam Saran Negi (101), kept his date with the elections this time too and cast his vote at Kalpa, where he received a special welcome at the booth. For years, Negi has been hailed as an example of keeping the democratic spirit alive in the mountains, especially high altitude valleys, by religiously turning up to vote in every election.“Maine apna farz nibhaya (I performed my duty),” he said as he walked out of the polling booth with help of officials of the district administration.“(PM Narendra) Modi accha aadmi hai, woh desh-hit ki baat karta hai..(Modi is a good person, he speaks for the country’s betterment),” he said.Negi has not skipped voting in a single election since October 25, 1951 — the day on which he became the first person to vote in Independent India’s first general election. He is the only surviving voter of Kinnaur in Himachal Pradesh, which went to the polls much before rest of India in 1951. “That time the polls were advanced by five months before rest of India voted.

'CENTRAL BOARD of Film Certification chairman Prasoon Joshi said on Saturday that the CBFC sent back the movie Padmavati to the filmmakers without certification because it did not contain a disclaimer specifying whether it was a work of fiction or a historical.Joshi also hit out at the fimmakers for holding a preview screening without obtaining a CBFC certification. “In this specific case, the film’s application only came up this week for review. The makers know and admit that the paperwork is not complete. The very disclaimer, whether the film is a work of fiction or a historical, was left blank and not stated. On simply and legitimately being asked to provide important documents, they have targeted the CBFC for the delay. This is truly surprising,” said Joshi.The film, directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali with Deepika Padukone in the title role, is scheduled to release on December 1. The movie has faced widespread protests by the Karni Sena in Rajasthan over “distortion of historical facts”, and the UP government has asked the I&B Ministry to defer its release to prevent an “adverse effect” on the law and order situation in the state.Responding to reports of a preview screening, Joshi said, “It’s disappointing that the film Padmavati is being screened for the media and getting reviewed on national channels without the CBFC having seen or certified the film. This compromises the role of systems and balances that are part of a functioning industry.”Joshi said it was “myopic” to treat the official certification process “haphazardly to suit one’s convenience”. “On one hand, holding the CBFC responsible and pressurising to accelerate the process and, on the other hand, attempting to subvert the very process, sets an opportunistic precedent… The CBFC is a responsible body and has the best interests of the industry and society. Let’s not let convenient and casual methods be brought into the practice. We must all have a responsible, mutually respectful and balanced approach,” he said.Vivek Agnihotri, film director and CBFC member, said, “We (the CBFC) haven’t denied anything. Every film has to go through due process for certification. The producers had sent us the script of the film. But each film has to have a disclaimer in the beginning, which cites whether the film is based on true events, is a work of fiction or is inspired. The script did not have that. They need to complete the paperwork, that’s all.”Describing the certification process, Agnihotri said, “It’s a computer-based algorithm, which is similar to that of a passport form or Aadhaar card… if your paperwork is incomplete, they reject your application. They have to send a complete thing, and once everything is in place, we shall view it like any other film.”Agnihotri said that “people need to stop giving into the demands of those who hold the film fraternity to ransom”. “The industry is equally to be blamed. Every time, somebody armtwists you, we succumb to their demands. At the time of Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, I had said that Karan Johar should not have apologised. As a film fraternity, we should have taken a stand and not released any film till this phenomenon stops,” he said.',real
'WASHINGTON: The hackers who upended the US presidential election had ambitions well beyond Hillary Clinton\'s campaign, targeting the emails of Ukrainian officers, Russian opposition figures, US defence contractors and thousands of others of interest to the Kremlin, according to a previously unpublished digital hit list obtained by The Associated Press. The list provides the most detailed forensic evidence yet of the close alignment between the hackers and the Russian government, exposing an operation that stretched back years and tried to break into the inboxes of 4,700 Gmail users across the globe -- from the pope\'s representative in Kiev to the punk band Pussy Riot in Moscow. \"It\'s a wish list of who you\'d want to target to further Russian interests,\" said Keir Giles, director of the Conflict Studies Research Center in Cambridge, England, and one of five outside experts who reviewed the AP\'s findings. He said the data was \"a master list of individuals whom Russia would like to spy on, embarrass, discredit or silence.\" The AP findings draw on a database of 19,000 malicious links collected by cybersecurity firm Secureworks, dozens of rogue emails, and interviews with more than 100 hacking targets. Secureworks stumbled upon the data after a hacking group known as Fancy Bear accidentally exposed part of its phishing operation to the internet. The list revealed a direct line between the hackers and the leaks that rocked the presidential contest in its final stages, most notably the private emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. The issue of who hacked the Democrats is back in the national spotlight following the revelation Monday that a Donald Trump campaign official, George Papadopoulos, was briefed early last year that the Russians had \"dirt\" on Clinton, including \"thousands of emails.\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the notion that Russia interfered \"unfounded.\" But the list examined by AP provides powerful evidence that the Kremlin did just that. \"This is the Kremlin and the general staff,\" said Andras Racz, a specialist in Russian security policy at Pazmany Peter Catholic University in Hungary, as he examined the data. \"I have no doubts.\" The new evidence Secureworks\' list covers the period between March 2015 and May 2016. Most of the identified targets were in the United States, Ukraine, Russia, Georgia and Syria. In the United States, which was Russia\'s Cold War rival, Fancy Bear tried to pry open at least 573 inboxes belonging to those in the top echelons of the country\'s diplomatic and security services: then-Secretary of State John Kerry, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, then-NATO Supreme Commander, US Air Force Gen. Philip Breedlove, and one of his predecessors, US Army Gen. Wesley Clark. The list skewed toward workers for defence contractors such as Boeing, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin or senior intelligence figures, prominent Russia watchers and -- especially -- Democrats. More than 130 party workers, campaign staffers and supporters of the party were targeted, including Podesta and other members of Clinton\'s inner circle. The AP also found a handful of Republican targets. Podesta, Powell, Breedlove and more than a dozen Democratic targets besides Podesta would soon find their private correspondence dumped to the web. The AP has determined that all had been targeted by Fancy Bear, most of them three to seven months before the leaks. \"They got two years of email,\" Powell recently told AP. He said that while he couldn\'t know for sure who was responsible, \"I always suspected some Russian connection.\" In Ukraine, which is fighting a grinding war against Russia-backed separatists, Fancy Bear attempted to break into at least 545 accounts, including those of President Petro Poroshenko and his son Alexei, half a dozen current and former ministers such as Interior Minister Arsen Avakov and as many as two dozen current and former lawmakers. The list includes Serhiy Leshchenko, an opposition parliamentarian who helped uncover the off-the-books payments allegedly made to Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort -- whose indictment was unsealed Monday in Washington. In Russia, Fancy Bear focused on government opponents and dozens of journalists. Among the targets were oil tycoon-turned-Kremlin foe Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who spent a decade in prison and now lives in exile, and Pussy Riot\'s Maria Alekhina. Along with them were 100 more civil society figures, including anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny and his lieutenants. \"Everything on this list fits,\" said Vasily Gatov, a Russian media analyst who was himself among the targets. He said Russian authorities would have been particularly interested in Navalny, one of the few opposition leaders with a national following. Many of the targets have little in common except that they would have been crossing the Kremlin\'s radar: an environmental activist in the remote Russian port city of Murmansk; a small political magazine in Armenia; the Vatican\'s representative in Kiev; an adult education organization in Kazakhstan. \"It\'s simply hard to see how any other country would be particularly interested in their activities,\" said Michael Kofman, an expert on Russian military affairs at the Woodrow Wilson International Center in Washington. He was also on the list. \"If you\'re not Russia,\" he said, \"hacking these people is a colossal waste of time.\" Working 9 to 6 Moscow time Allegations that Fancy Bear works for Russia aren\'t new. But raw data has been hard to come by. Researchers have been documenting the group\'s activities for more than a decade and many have accused it of being an extension of Russia\'s intelligence services. The \"Fancy Bear\" nickname is a none-too-subtle reference to Russia\'s national symbol. In the wake of the 2016 election, US intelligence agencies publicly endorsed the consensus view, saying what American spooks had long alleged privately: Fancy Bear is a creature of the Kremlin. But the US intelligence community provided little proof, and even media-friendly cybersecurity companies typically publish only summaries of their data. That makes the Secureworks\' database a key piece of public evidence -- all the more remarkable because it\'s the result of a careless mistake. Secureworks effectively stumbled across it when a researcher began working backward from a server tied to one of Fancy Bear\'s signature pieces of malicious software. He found a hyperactive Bitly account Fancy Bear was using to sneak thousands of malicious links past Google\'s spam filter. Because Fancy Bear forgot to set the account to private, Secureworks spent the next few months hovering over the group\'s shoulder, quietly copying down the details of the thousands of emails it was targeting. The AP obtained the data recently, boiling it down to 4,700 individual email addresses, and then connecting roughly half to account holders. The AP validated the list by running it against a sample of phishing emails obtained from people targeted and comparing it to similar rosters gathered independently by other cybersecurity companies, such as Tokyo-based Trend Micro and the Slovakian firm ESET. The Secureworks data allowed reporters to determine that more than 95 per cent of the malicious links were generated during Moscow office hours -- between 9 am and 6 pm Monday to Friday. The AP\'s findings also track with a report that first brought Fancy Bear to the attention of American voters. In 2016, a cybersecurity company known as CrowdStrike said the Democratic National Committee had been compromised by Russian hackers, including Fancy Bear. Secureworks\' roster shows Fancy Bear making aggressive attempts to hack into DNC technical staffers\' emails in early April 2016 -- exactly when CrowdStrike says the hackers broke in. And the raw data enabled the AP to speak directly to the people who were targeted, many of whom pointed the finger at the Kremlin. \"We have no doubts about who is behind these attacks,\" said Artem Torchinskiy, a project coordinator with Navalny\'s Anti-Corruption Fund who was targeted three times in 2015. \"I am sure these are hackers controlled by Russian secret services.\" The myth of the 400-pound man Even if only a small fraction of the 4,700 Gmail accounts targeted by Fancy Bear were hacked successfully, the data drawn from them could run into terabytes -- easily rivaling the biggest known leaks in journalistic history. For the hackers to have made sense of that mountain of messages -- in English, Ukrainian, Russian, Georgian, Arabic and many other languages -- they would have needed a substantial team of analysts and translators. Merely identifying and sorting the targets took six AP reporters eight weeks of work. The AP\'s effort offers \"a little feel for how much labor went into this,\" said Thomas Rid, a professor of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins University\'s School of Advanced International Studies. He said the investigation should put to rest any theories like the one then-candidate Donald Trump floated last year that the hacks could be the work of \"someone sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.\" \"The notion that it\'s just a lone hacker somewhere is utterly absurd,\" Rid said.

'Eighteen-year-old Zakir Ali Tyagi was just kidding when he asked, on Facebook, exactly how the river Ganga was a \"living entity\". He also went on to discuss the BJP\'s Ram Mandir plans. For these random comments on Facebook, the Muzaffarnagar teen was made to spend 42 days in jail, paying bribes even to use the toilet. He was picked up by the police this April, and booked under Section 420 (cheating) of the IPC and Section 66 of the IT Act. He was brutally beaten, and called a terrorist. By the time he emerged from jail, he had lost his job at a nearby steel plant. Across Indian states, citizens like Tyagi are being picked up by the police for unguarded comments on social media, and the arbitrariness of these arrests has created a climate of anxiety. In most cases to hit the news, those charged have been ordinary people, without the clout to incite mass violence. On November 2 this year, Meerut-based journalist Afghan Soni was charged with defamation and \"computer-related offences\" (Section 66 of the IT Act) for posting a derogatory video of Narendra Modi. What was the \"offensive\" video? Modi asking a rally about \" achhe din \", and getting his response not from a crowd of people, but a herd of goats. Social media arrests are not new, and nor are they a uniquely Indian form of repression. The UPA-era Section 66A of the IT Act, scrapped by the Supreme Court in 2015, was broadly worded enough to book you if you caused annoyance, inconvenience, insult or injury online. In 2012 and 2013, a girl from Palghar, Maharashtra was arrested for criticising Bal Thackeray\'s state funeral+ on Facebook, another girl for merely \"liking\" that comment; a professor from Kolkata was arrested for forwarding a cartoon about Mamata Banerjee; as was a man who tweeted about Karthi Chidambaram\'s disproportionate wealth. But now, even though Section 66A is gone, the muzzling of speech continues unabated. And perhaps more than political dispensation, this is about the misplaced zeal of the criminal justice system, its general disregard for free speech, and its hypersensitivity to speech that irritates the political establishment. India, like every other country in the world, places reasonable fetters on free expression. These include a threat to public order, dangerously stirring up religious sensitivities, caste slurs, defamation, child pornography, and so on. \"But the real problem is the misuse of these legal provisions by police officials going overboard,\" says N Ramachandran, a former DGP and president of the Indian Police Foundation. \"Rather than rushing to arrest, the police should weigh the culpability and potential impact impartially, with utmost caution,\" he says. Other sections of the IT Act, including clauses on obscenity and morphing, are being used to arrest people, says lawyer and internet freedom advocate Apar Gupta. The morphing of images may be a concern when women are misrepresented, but \"by itself, a morphed image in a political caricature or piece of satire is not an illegal or criminal act\", he says. Similarly, lying and cussing are human activities that also exist online; they do not inherently deserve criminal sanction. Even rumours are not illegal by themselves, the CrPC should kick in only in instances where they might incite violence or have other criminal implications. WhatsApp is where these tensions are strongest. Given that the technology can be used to make trouble on a wide scale, the police has good reason to keep an eye on the platform. But increasingly, WhatsApp administrators have been booked even for harmless remarks. \"There\'s a trend of using Section 144 of the CrPC, which applies to unlawful assemblies, to WhatsApp discussions,\" says Gupta. Recall the Indore collector who invoked it to deter any conversation about demonetisation, or the Varanasi DM who said that any false content on a WhatsApp group was grounds for arrest. \"This is a threat, rather than a fair legal warning,\" says Gupta. \"Of course, these charges will not hold in a court of law. But the person booked has to endure the system for a while, and deal with the harassment,\" says lawyer Akhil Sibal. In his view, the internet is a uniquely liberating space, one that is harder to regulate, but it cannot be exempt from the laws that govern the offline world. \"This is the crossroads that the world is at, different jurisdictions are grappling with these questions,\" he says. These social media arrests are just symptomatic of a larger invasion of free speech, in Sibal\'s view. \"Look at the way everyone is outraging about the movie Padmavati without anyone having seen it. It\'s the same with the trigger-happy criminal justice system,\" he says. Still, these arrests create a chilling effect on speech, says Gupta. The likelihood of someone, somewhere, taking legal action constrains you to watch your words more than necessary. Rather than a lively, democratic public sphere, we could end up with the hushed, wary conversations of a police state.

'If someone thanks you “soooo” much on WhatsApp, there is no reason to mark it as a sloppy message. New research has found that “textisms” – emoticons, irregular spellings and exclamation points in text messages – help convey meaning and intent in the absence of spoken conversation.“Textisms” is not a sign that written language is going down the tubes, according to the study published in the journal Computers in Human Behavior.“In contrast with face-to-face conversation, texters can’t rely on extra-linguistic cues such as tone of voice and pauses, or non-linguistic cues such as facial expressions and hand gestures,” said Celia Klin, Professor at Binghamton University, State University of New York.“In a spoken conversation, the cues aren’t simply add-ons to our words; they convey critical information. A facial expression or a rise in the pitch of our voices can entirely change the meaning of our words,” Klin pointed out.It has been suggested that one way to add meaning to the words in text messages is by using “textisms”– things like emoticons, irregular spellings (sooooo) and irregular use of punctuation (!!!), Klin said.A 2016 study led by Klin found that text messages that end with a period are seen as less sincere than text messages that do not end with a period.Klin pursued this subject further, conducting experiments to see if people reading texts understand textisms, asking how people’s understanding of a single-word text ( such as yeah, nope, maybe) as a response to an invitation is influenced by the inclusion, or absence, of a period.“In formal writing, such as what you’d find in a novel or an essay, the period is almost always used grammatically to indicate that a sentence is complete. With texts, we found that the period can also be used rhetorically to add meaning,” said Klin.The study concluded that although periods no doubt can serve a grammatical function in texts just as they can with more formal writing — for example, when a period is at the end of a sentence — periods can also serve as textisms, changing the meaning of the text.The researchers believe that with electronic communication, scientists can observe language evolving in real time.“What we are seeing with electronic communication is that, as with any unmet language need, new language constructions are emerging to fill the gap between what people want to express and what they are able to express with the tools they have available to them,” said Klin.“The findings indicate that our understanding of written language varies across contexts. We read text messages in a slightly different way than we read a novel or an essay. Further, all the elements of our texts — the punctuation we choose, the way that words are spelled, a smiley face — can change the meaning,” Klin said.',real
'BOULDER, Colo. -- Weather could be to blame for hundreds of dead fish found in a Boulder lake, CBS Denver reports.The dead fish were spotted floating in Tantra Lake over the weekend, causing confusion and alarm for people living in the area.\"It\'s pretty strange,\" said Trevor Pellerite, a resident of the Tantra Lake apartments. \"I was just fishing here early last week and it looked to be in order.\"Pellerite said he often goes fishing in the man-made lake, but he\'s now worries that whatever caused the fish to die could affect him and his dog.\"I\'m confused and it\'s pretty scary,\" he said.Water quality experts with the City of Boulder took samples from the lake Monday to determine what caused the fish to die.

'With the IBPS Clerk exam just about two weeks away, we are sure that your preparation levels are at an all-time high. While it is necessary to work hard and prepare diligently, it is also important to prepare smartly. One should keep in mind that exams such as IBPS clerk do not require a person to score 100 per cent marks to succeed. In fact, all that one needs to do is to clear the cut-offs and maximise their scores.In this post, we bring to you an analysis of previous year’s cut-offs of the IBPS Clerk examination in order to help you prepare more efficiently.IBPS clerk cut-offs: 2016 prelims and mainsPlease note that these cut-offs will be applied in two stages:(i) Sectional cut-offs: These are the marks a candidate needs to score in each section in order to qualify.(ii) Overall cut-offs: The overall or category-wise cut-offs are the qualifying marks a candidate has to score in order to be eligible for the subsequent stage. The overall cut-offs are different for each category (general, SC, ST, OBC, PWD etc).Apart from these, the IBPS also releases state-wise cut-off marks. These vary as per the state a candidate has applied from. The state-wise cut-off is different for each state and can be higher or lower than the overall cut-off range.IBPS Clerk – 2016: Sectional cut-off marks for the prelims1 Numerical Ability 10.75 for general category, 6.75 for OBC, 6.75 for SC and 6.75 for ST\r\n2 Reasoning Ability 10.25 for general category, 5.75 for OBC, 5.75 for SC and 5.75 for ST\r\n3 English Language 7.75 for general category, 4.25 for OBC, 4.25 for SC and 4.25 for ST*Note that these may vary from state to state.State-wise overall cut-offs for IBPS Clerk Prelims 2016 Andhra Pradesh 73 for general category and 73 for OBC\r\nBihar 67.5 for general category and 67.5 for OBC\r\nChandigarh 61.5 for general category\r\nChhattisgarh 63.75  for general category\r\nDelhi 67.25  for general category and 61.75 for OBC\r\nGujarat 58.75 for general category\r\nHaryana 68 61.5 for general category\r\nHimachal Pradesh 66.5\r\nJ&K 68.75\r\nJharkhand 70.75\r\nKarnataka 58.25 for general category and 53.75 for SC\r\nKerala 71\r\nMadhya Pradesh 65.75 for general category, 67.5 for OBC and 41.5 for ST\r\nMaharashtra 59.25 for general category, 59.25 for OBC\r\nMeghalaya 65.75 for general category\r\nOrissa 70.75 for general category\r\nPunjab 66.5 for general category\r\nRajasthan 66.75 for general category\r\nTamil Nadu 58 for general category and 58 for OBC\r\nTelangana  65\r\nUttar Pradesh 67.75 for general category and 63.75  for OBC\r\nUttarakhand 71.25\r\nWest Bengal 70.5Go through the following important topics to crack IBPS Clerk Prelims 2017 with a good score:Reading Comprehension\r\nExpect about 10 questions of the RC type. In IBPS clerk the RC would mostly be story based. It is advisable to practice different levels of reading comprehension regularly to master this question type.Close test\r\nHere, a scenario or story may be given as a passage which would have blanks in between. The one thing you have to take care of is that all words you fill the given blanks with must fit in with the context of the passage.Error spotting\r\nOne can expect 5-10 questions from this topic. Articles, conditional sentences, tenses, singular, plurals, subject-verb agreement are some of the most important concepts for error spotting questions.Para-jumbles\r\nExpect about 5 questions of this type in clerk prelims. Try to identify the first and last line of the jumbled paragraph first, as they’re comparatively easy to single out.Odd one out\r\nThis is another important question type. Try finding the common theme among the given sentences and then it would be easy to pick the one that does not talk about the same thing.Para completion\r\nIt is a rather new but an extremely important topic in clerk prelims.

'UNITED NATIONS: India\'s nominee to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) Dalveer Bhandari was today re-elected to the last seat of the world court after Britain withdrew its candidate from the election. Bhandari received 183-193 votes in the General Assembly and secured all the 15 votes in the Security Council after separate and simultaneous elections were held at the UN headquarters in New York. The elections were held after United Kingdom, in a dramatic turn of events, withdrew out of the race for the Hague-based ICJ, thus paving the way for Bhandari\'s re-election to the prestigious world court. Bhandari and Britain\'s Christopher Greenwood were locked in a neck-and-neck fight for re-election to the ICJ. The permanent members of the Security Council- the US, Russia, France and China -- were understood to have been throwing their weight behind Greenwood. Britain is the fifth permanent member of the Security Council. In a dramatic turn of events, the British Permanent Representative to the UN, Matthew Rycroft, wrote identical letters to the presidents of the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council, before the two chambers were scheduled to meet at 3 pm (local time) for the 12th round of voting. Read out simultaneously by both the presidents of the General Assembly and the Security Council, Rycroft said that its candidate Judge Christopher Greenwood had decided to withdraw from the election to the 15-membered ICJ. He along with Bhandari were seeking re-election for the nine-year term. In the 11 rounds of voting, Bhandari had got nearly two-thirds of the votes in the General Assembly and in Security Council Greenwood consistently received nine votes as against five for his opponent. This resulted in a stalemate. As per the letter read out simultaneously in the General Assembly and the Security Council, Rycroft said the current deadlock is unlikely to be broken by further rounds of voting. As such he announced withdrawal from the race. With Bhandari being the only candidate left in the race, the General Assembly and Security Council still went through the formal motion of voting to complete the formalities. The voting in the General Assembly which overwhelmingly favours India is reflective of the new global order, which is not pleasant to the world powers. India has been seeking that the democratic process need to be played its full course in both the Security Council and the General Assembly and there should not be an intervention or adoption of a process that has never been used before or the one that undermines the voice of the majority.

'UNITED NATIONS: The permanent members of the UN Security Council are \'unnerved\' by the prospect of India\'s nominee Dalveer Bhandari winning against Britain\'s candidate in the election to the last seat of the World Court as it would set a precedent that may challenge their power in the future, observers here feel. Bhandari and Britain\'s Christopher Greenwood are locked in a neck-and-neck fight for re-election to the Hague-based International Court of Justice+ , the sources say. The permanent members of the Security Council -- the US, Russia, France and China -- appeared to have rallied behind Greenwood. Britain is the fifth permanent member of the Security Council. In the 11 rounds of election so far, Bhandari has been receiving support of nearly two-third of the members of the General Assembly, but is trailing by three votes against Greenwood in the Security Council. The 12th round of elections has been scheduled for Monday. Britain on Friday in an informal consultation of the UN Security Council members mooted the idea of joint conference mechanism as it feels that this could be their only face saving exit strategy, informed sources said. As shared with other members of the Security Council during informal consultations, Britain would prefer to stop voting on the ICJ elections+ after the first round as it fears that otherwise India could well cross the two-third mark. In that scenario it would be very difficult for the UN Security Council stop India\'s candidate from being elected to the ICJ. However, the prospect of India winning against a P5 member through democratic means is something that this elite club of veto-wielding countries - Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States - are unnerved with, because this would set a precedent that they do not want to be repeated. \"Today it is Britain, tomorrow it could be any one of us\" is the argument which has brought all these five countries together, sources say. \"If the one (of the P5) is going to be knocked off today, the other fear that they might be knocked off tomorrow,\" according to a source. Such an assessment of the UN insiders is based on informed sources, as voting for the ICJ election in both the Security Council and the General Assembly are based on secret ballots and there is no way to know who voted for whom. In all the rounds of the election so far, Greenwood has consistently got nine votes and Bhandari five in the Security Council. It is likely that on Monday India might increase its tally. It is understood that both New Delhi and Permanent Mission of India to the UN have been working overtime to convince the members of the Security Council on the need to go by the voice of the majority of the General Assembly. But by Sunday evening it appeared that Britain was ready to execute its plan, as per which after the first round of voting they would call for a meeting of the Security Council and would seek a mandate to stop any further round of voting, and would call for adoption of joint conference mechanism, which was last adopted in 1921. However, this might come as a silver lining for India, sources said. This is because the Security Council vote to stop further rounds of the ICJ election would be open and not through a secret ballot. As a result, countries, many of whom have been pledging friendship with India but secretly voting against its candidate would be exposed in the open of raising their hands against India. This is something that members of the Security Council would avoid. Of the Permanent Five members, the US under President Donald Trump has just come out a 100-year plan of friendship with India and renamed Asia-Pacific and the Indo-Pacific region. Incidentally, hours before the ICJ election, Trump would be meeting Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and his Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley at the White House. It is not sure, if Trump plans to weigh in on this issue in favour of India. Trump has repeatedly called himself as the \"best friend of India and Indian Americans\" in the White House. Russia is an all-weather tested friend of India. Over the past several decades, France has emerged as a reliable friend of India. The stand of China on a lot of issues is well known including India\'s membership to the Security Council and Beijing vetoing a move to designate Azhar Masood as a global terrorist by the UN. So, it would be quite a surprise, if China favoured an Indian candidate. \"When chips are down, you always get support from developing countries,\" commented one India watcher at the UN. The voting in the General Assembly which overwhelmingly favours India is reflective of the new global order, which is not pleasant to the world powers. Despite best of the British effort, their vote tally in the General Assembly has decreased with every other round of voting. \"That\'s why they are trying to find a face saver to get out of this,\" a source said. India has been seeking that the democratic process need to be played its full course in both the Security Council and the General Assembly and there should not be an intervention or adoption of a process that has never been used before or the one that undermines the voice of the majority. The British move to stop voting after the first round might create bad blood between two important wings of the world body, which could have a long-term implication. The General Assembly might think that it has been denied its right to vote. Hours ahead of the scheduled vote the UN General Assembly president and Security Council president is likely to hold another round of consultation with the stakeholders to explore what are their options.

'NEW DELHI: As the world remains riveted by an epic battle between India and the UK for the post of a judge at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the government is going all out to thwart a bid by the UK to stall voting at the UN General Assembly where India\'s candidate Dalveer Bhandari+ enjoys support of more than 120 countries. As first reported by TOI on Sunday, the UK is instead looking to invoke a mechanism of GA and Security Council Joint Conference, which has never been used in the history of ICJ+ , to choose the judge and, in the process, invalidate popular support for Bhandari. The UK\'s candidate Christopher Greenwood holds on to a slender lead in the 15-member Council and, under the present rules, this is enough to offset the nearly two-thirds support for Bhandari in the GA. For India, the election has now reached a tipping point and, as India\'s permanent representative to the UN Syed Akbaruddin said on Friday, the election was no longer about an individual. \"It is now about whether the outcome of the election of the World Court... that is what it is, the ICJ is the World Court... reflects the sentiments of \'we the peoples of the world\'? Does it reflect the democratic spirit of our times? The only gauge of that is the General Assembly of the United Nations,\'\' he had said. The UK, which fears that more voting in the GA will only see Bhandari\'s lead increase, needs nine votes from the Security Council for its proposal to stall the process of voting for the ICJ judge. In the Council, Greenwood has the votes of nine nations but it remains to be seen if the same nine support what India sees as a clearly undemocratic move by the UK. As Indian officials pointed out, a joint conference, which comprises three members each from the GA and the Council, has never been used in the entire history of seven decades of the ICJ to select a judge. \"The only time it was used was prior to the establishment of the United Nations in 1921, when deputy judges for the Permanent Court of International Justice were selected,\" said an official. Agency reports from New York quoted official sources on Sunday that UK was playing \"dirty politics\" to deny Bhandari victory. In all past cases of deadlock, it has always been the candidate with majority in the GA that has gone on to be elected judge at the ICJ.

'AROUND 11.45 every night, ‘Kumar Anna’ pulls in on a bicycle next to Inorbit Mall in Goregaon, three large steel cans and a stack of paper cups hanging from the handlebars. In the shadows of the mall, under a streetlight, he props up his bicycle, sets up his idli-wada shop and waits for business to begin. He has been doing this almost every night for 14 years now and that has earned him a string of loyal customers.By 12.15 am, a crowd gathers around him. “I didn’t always sell idlis and wadas. For almost a decade, I hawked coffee at night. But always at night,” said Kumar, who refuses to be identified by his actual name. “The idea to sell at night came out of desperation,” he added.When he moved from Tirunelveli to Mumbai in 1994 looking for a job, he couldn’t find one. Kumar started to borrow utensils from a tea vendor at night and making coffee. He would sell the coffee at night and return the utensils in the morning. “Near the footpaths in Marve where I stayed, I met a tea vendor who shut his shop by 10pm. That’s when the idea struck and eventually, I realised there was a demand for food and tea at night,” he said.“I am aware it is illegal to hawk at night. But people work round-the-clock in the city and need to eat. As long as I am careful about my business, I can manage,” Kumar said.Today, Kumar has a dedicated workspace where a team of two prepares idlis, wadas, sambhar and chutneys.\r\nOn a good day, he sells food to almost 200 customers between 12 midnight and 3 am. “There are a bunch of call centres in the area that work late in the night. So, there are customers every day. But business is better on weekends,” said Kumar.Apart from call centre employees, he has a few regular customers from the garbage collection unit of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). An employee of the BMC’s solid waste management department said: “For those of us on the night shift, there is hardly any option as most food outlets are shut. When we are hungry, we drop by Kumar Anna’s idli shop. He has always maintained his quality and it is affordable.”A plate of idlis or wadas costs Rs 35 and tea and coffee are priced at Rs 15.',real
'MANILA: President Rodrigo Duterte crooned a hit Filipino love song at a dinner in Manila for leaders from across Asia, explaining later that it was \"on the orders of US President Donald Trump\". Trump and Duterte were among 19 leaders at a glittering gala in the Philippines capital on Sunday ahead of an annual summit, and at one point Duterte took the microphone to sing \"Ikaw\" (You), in a duet with local pop diva Pilita Corrales. One of the song\'s verses, translated from Filipino, begins: \"You are the light in my world, a half of this heart of mine\". \"Ladies and gentlemen, I sang uninvited, upon the orders of the commander-in-chief of the United States,\" Duterte said later, according to the ABS-CBN news channel. Duterte, who is sometimes described as the \'Trump of the East\' because of his brash style, is due to meet the US president on the sidelines of the summit on Monday. The United States and its former colony, the Philippines, have been strategic allies since World War Two. But their relations have been strained by anti-US outbursts from Duterte and his enthusiasm for better ties with Russia and China. More than 3,900 Filipinos have been killed in a war on drugs that Duterte declared when he took office last year. His government says the police act in self defence, but critics say executions are taking place with no accountability. Duterte said last week he would tell the US president to \"lay off\" if he raised the issue of human rights when they met. But Trump, who has been criticised at home for neglecting rights issues in dealings abroad, praised Duterte in May for doing an \"unbelievable job on the drug problem\". Trump and leaders of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, China, Russia, Japan, Canada, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand were entertained by singers and dancers at the dinner. Each of the men sported a cream-coloured barong, a traditional Philippines shirt made of fibre from the pineapple plant, hand-embroidered and worn untucked. They were served a four-course Filipino-Asian fusion meal curate and prepared by Chef Jessie Sincioco, who also designed the menu for Pope Francis when he visited the Philippines in 2015.

'On October 7, a boulder the size of house broke off a mountain in the Araku Valley region in Andhra Pradesh and fell on a 50-year-old railway bridge, destroying one of its piers for good and rendering the country’s highest broad-gauge freight line useless.Within five days, Indian Railways started the work of restoring the bridge, including building a 28-metre pier rooted in the rocky range from scratch, diverting a waterfall that has a sharp eight-degree curve, and restoring the steep tracks. The deadline: 60 days.While the government has brought in the Army to build three foot over bridges in Mumbai suburban stations for “faster execution of work”, this project being executed by the East Coast Railway Zone is not just an engineering challenge but also requires time-bound execution on a “war footing”. The work is being monitored 24X7 with drones and other wireless camera feeds, right up to the level of the Railway Board.“We are on schedule. Traffic will be restored by December 12, as targeted,” Umesh Singh, General Manager of East Coast Railway, told The Sunday Express.The 445-km Kothavalasa-Kirandul line, known simply as the KK line, running through the dense mountains of the Eastern Ghats, is the steepest broad-gauge freight line in the Indian Railways, connecting the NMDC’s iron ore mines in Chhattisgarh with Vishakhapatnam’s steel plants and port. The line and bridge were commissioned in the late 1960s, with financial and technical assistance from Japan, to aid India’s push towards industrialisation. It has 58 tunnels and 84 major bridges, including the 85-metre ‘Bridge 249’ that is now being rebuilt.In the absence of the line, freight is currently being moved on the Koraput-Rayagada-Vizianagram line, which is a 150-km diversion. The boulder weighing nearly 700 tonnes that fell on the bridge not only shattered its pier but also dislodged the iron girders. In the dense mountains, the access to the site of the bridge to carry out the work is blocked by a waterfall.“From the day the damage was discovered, we have been on war mode, so to speak. An emergency single tender was given out within a couple of days. We are losing around Rs 2 crore per day in the absence of the line, so the timeline for the job is non-negotiable,” said Mukul S Mathur, Divisonal Railway Manager (DRM) of Waltair Divison of East Coast Railway, which is carrying out the work. The entire Indian Railways network is divided into 68 divisions, each headed by a DRM.It involved first breaking the damaged pier that held the bridge upright, removing the girder, and making a fresh pier, while negotiating the topography that is treacherous not just for the workers but also the heavy machinery. Apart from the waterfall that has to be diverted, the bridge is flanked by tunnels on both sides.The Waltair Division estimates the restoration will cost Rs 7 crore. The engineers laid out a 500-metre approach to get the men and machinery to the base of the pier, while the waterfall was diverted using pipes and channels to reach the bridge. The damaged pier was broken using short-fuse controlled explosives and special chemicals, and the girder was carried away while holding up the remaining bridge with a temporary crib structure.',real
'Twelve years after you wrote The World is Flat, globalisation and its certainties seem to have been overturned.\r\nThe book was about how we had created a global economic playing field, where more people can connect and collaborate. The technologies that were flattening and integrating the world are alive and well. They are even more powerful than when I wrote the book. Some people are trying to resist the implications of that and shaking their fists at change.But something like Brexit is a big blow.\r\nThose are real big blows. But the world is more interconnected than ever. And in such a world, you get a geopolitical inversion: your rival’s fall is more dangerous than its rise. If China takes six more islands in the South China Sea, I couldn’t care less. But if China loses six per cent growth, this hotel [in Bengaluru] will be affected. Those forces are very much at play. It does not mean that no one will resist them, but the price you pay in resisting them will be bigger than ever.Your most recent book, Thank You For Being Late (2016, Allen Lane), tries to understand the future of work in an age of “accelerations”.\r\nOnce a vast majority of us worked with their hands, then came a time when we worked with our hands, and in the age to come, we will work with our hearts. Because that’s the only thing a machine will never have.In the book, I interview Vivek Murthy, the Indian-American surgeon general who Donald Trump fired. I asked him what the most lethal disease in America was. Cancer, heart disease or diabetes? He said, ‘None of those. It is isolation.’ If that’s the case, connecting hearts to hearts will be a big industry.What does that mean?\r\nFor example, take Paint Nite, the fastest growing restaurant chain in America in 2015. It allows adults to come together in bars, they paint by numbers and have a drink together. The thing is that people want to be connected. The more we are online, the more we want to rub up against another human. And I think that’s the next growth industry.You write that the worker of the future has to be someone who is constantly updating herself. Isn’t this just the kind of psychological pressure that people are unable to keep up with and that led to the anger against globalisation?\r\nYes, no question. One of my teachers, Heather McGowan, says that the days when you would get a four-year degree and then expect to dine on it for the next 30 years are over. Because what you learn in your first year is going to be outdated by your fourth year. So, the single-most important competitive advantage is to be a lifelong learner. She also says that you should never ask a kid today what you want to be when you grow up. Because whatever it is, unless it is a cop or a fireman, the job isn’t going to be there. Only ask: how are you going to be who you are? Are you predisposed to be a lifelong learner? A lot of people are built to do what they are told. But doing what you are told is not going to be enough. That has a lot of people freaked out. And I think it is frightening to people to be in a constant learning mode. And that’s going to be a challenge.But can this be something left to the individual alone? What role do governments and corporations have to play in this?\r\nVery good question. The reason my book ends in my hometown of Minnesota is not because of nostalgia. I believe that as the world accelerates, national governments are not going to be fast enough to cope with this pace. At the other extreme, the single family is way too weak to resist these accelerations. So, I am arguing that the proper government for the 21stcentury is the healthy community. There is a lot more civic trust at that level. If I were running for president, which I am not, I would run as a progressive localist…In the book, I talk about AT&T. The tech company has created in-house nano degrees and is giving its employees money to take the courses and train themselves. Its social contract with its employees is that you can be a lifelong employee but only if you are a lifelong learner. And that is the social contract coming to a neighbourhood near you.How does education cope?\r\nI have written about Opportunity@Work, an NGO which uses an intelligent algorithm to match what you can do to a job available. Many employers are no longer interested in your pedigree, but if you can do a job. And if someone can badge you — saying yes, you have this skill — an employer will say, I am going to hire you. It is a great avenue for those who started but could not finish college. These are all ways to accelerate learning.How far can globalisation go without fixing its inequality problem?\r\nYes, the top one per cent is getting fantastically rich. But the bottom is also rising, and I see that whenever I am in India. The gap is not getting bridged. That’s what tax policy is for, what governments are for. But I don’t think you tear the whole system down.How divisive has the Trump presidency been?\r\nI knew it was going to be bad, I didn’t know it was going to be this bad. It is a full-blown disaster. I believe Donald Trump is a disturbed person and he is also an indecent man. We have never had someone who is such a casual liar as our president. I see a steady breakdown of norms, which keep a society in check and moving forward.How do you see the press holding up?\r\nWe [The New York Times] are standing up. Our digital subscriptions are through the roof, and that’s partly thanks to Trump. Because people don’t want fake news, they want real news. The Washington Post is thriving. The war between the NYT and WaPO is a beautiful thing to watch. Two outstanding newspapers, based on real news value, every day going head to head, breaking stories.In the future, will we need oped writers?\r\nCan you programme a robot to have an opinion? I am sure you can but the idea to write The World is Flat came when I was talking to a bunch of human beings. I don’t think a computer can do it. It doesn’t have that kind of intuition.',real
'NEW DELHI: India and China have to \"live side by side\" whether they like it or not, Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama said on Sunday and asserted that the two countries can together work towards making a more compassionate world. The 82-year-old Buddhist monk also said Tibetans are not seeking independence or separation from China but meaningful autonomy, and added that he \"admired the European Union spirit\". The Tibetan spiritual leader appreciated the idea of the \"Union of India\". Citing his recent visit to Manipur where he learnt that some politicians wanted independence for the state, he said they needed to \"think broadly, more holistically\". He said that though India and China have their differences, Nalanda thoughts are not alien to them. Nalanda university, the ancient seat of learning in Bihar, attracted scholars from China, Korea, Japan, Tibet, Mongolia, Turkey, Sri Lanka, among other countries. These scholars have left records about the ambience, architecture and learning of this unique university. India and China can \"do something for a more compassionate world, more compassionate humanity\", the Nobel Peace Prize Laureate said. \"And then India and China, at a practical level also, neither one has the ability to destroy others. Whether you like it or not, you have to live side by side,\" he told reporters when asked about the strain in bilateral ties over the Doklam issue. Earlier during an interaction with children at an event here organised by the Smile Foundation, the Dalai Lama said many Chinese people appreciate Tibetan scholars\' knowledge of Nalanda. He said the Nalanda school of thought, a shared heritage of India, China and Tibet, can help resolve the Tibetan crisis. \"Many Chinese Buddhists are very very eager to learn from Tibetan masters. And, we are not seeking separation from China ... I really admire the European, the EU spirit ... of national sovereignty,\" he said. Amid all the linguistic and cultural diversity in India, it is a country that is the \"most stable, more peaceful\" of the Asian nations, he said. \"Here you have east India, north India and west India and south India ... different India, different scripts, different languages, but spirit of one India, which is wonderful,\" the Dalai Lama said. \"At a meeting, someone told me that some Maipur politicians want independence (for the state). I think they need to think broadly, more holistically. Union is important. Of course, I have no right to criticise,\" he said. Making a veiled reference to the Catalan movement, he said, \"In Spain, I think it was too short-sighted.\" \"It was time to think of one Europe. And, here (in India), you already have one nation... time to think long- sighted, about the wonderful Union of India,\" he said. Hailing India\'s ancient knowledge system, especially the one based on the Nalanda school of learning, the Tibetan spiritual leader appealed to India to lead the world in shaping an education system which will inspire students to think \"outward as much as inward\" and be wary of \"materialistic outlook\". At the event, he also announced that his philanthropy body will grant endowment to the Smile Foundation over the next five years.

'According to the latest data released by Dubai’s Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing (Dubai Tourism), India has retained top spot on Dubai’s list of source markets for inbound tourism, with 1,478,000 Indian tourists arriving in the city between January and September, registering a significant 20 per cent rise over the same period in 2016.This increase affirmed the effectiveness of various innovative promotional activities driven by Dubai Tourism in the market, including highly successful influencer-led collaborations with Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, a statement said.Saudi Arabia and the UK also retained their positions as Dubai’s second and third largest feeder markets.“The sustained growth ahead of the global average that we have witnessed so far this year is indicative of the positive impact yielded by our consolidated strategy across regulatory measures, promotional efforts, trade initiatives and partner programmes. Even as we continually work to ensure Dubai’s proposition remains stellar and globally competitive, drawing on the concerted cross-industry efforts of all stakeholders, our priority remains the delivery of the highest levels of visitor satisfaction.“Ultimately, our aim is to make every satisfied Dubai visitor our customer for life and our strongest advocate, in order to drive not only higher repeat traffic but also acquire newer audiences most efficiently, as we strive towards our 20 million target by 2020,” Helal Saeed Almarri, Director General, Dubai Tourism, said in a statement.Dubai’s hotel sector also saw significant growth, with the city’s total number of hotel and hotel apartment keys standing at 106,167 at the end of the third quarter of 2017. A total of 11.58 million international overnight visitors arrived in Dubai during the first nine months of 2017, reflecting a 7.5 per cent increase over the same period last year.And, in line with the 10X Agenda set by Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, “we are focused on continuously innovating, harnessing the power of data, redefining the customer journey and amplifying the voice of the traveller, to ensure that Dubai is a decade ahead of any other global city from a travel and tourism perspective,” Almarri added.',real
'Lahiru Thirimanne and Angelo Mathews were a study in contrast, batting wise. Thirimanne was fluent; Mathews, the former Sri Lanka captain, was tentative for long periods. But the tenacity to dig in provided the common thread.At 34 for two, Sri Lanka were in trouble, notwithstanding the fact that India’s first innings folded for 172. The sun eventually peeped out, but even a third day Eden Gardens pitch had been offering enough seam movement. Thirimanne surprisingly wasn’t picked for the home Test series against India three months ago. Mathews missed the Pakistan series that preceded Sri Lanka’s ongoing tour of India, because of a calf injury.On Saturday, Thirimanne and Mathews put on 99 runs for the third wicket and although they both got out in the final session, the visitors finished the day just seven runs shy of India’s first innings total, with six wickets in hand.India made early breakthroughs that were, as head coach Ravi Shastri might have said, just what the doctor ordered. The in-form Dimuth Karunaratne looked out of sorts, survived once on referral and then, shouldered arms to a Bhuvneshwar Kumar delivery that cut back into him sharply. The ball struck him on the knee-roll and the ball-tracking showed it was hitting the stumps.Kumar then removed Sadeera Samarawickrama with a back-of-a-length ball that seamed away and took the outside edge to Wriddhiman Saha. That was in the seventh over of Sri Lanka’s first innings. For the next 30 overs though, Thirimanne and Mathews remained unseparated and tilted the balance in their team’s favour.The Sri Lankans supposedly took a leaf out of Cheteshwar Pujara’s book. On this pitch it was important to play the ball on merit — without thinking about the previous delivery or what will come next. Pujara was the only Indian batsman to score a half-century in the Indian innings. He played the line, played close to his body and never tried to push at the delivery. The only time he erred, Pujara was bowled through the gate.Impatient bowling\r\nThirimanne and Mathews did just that. They were unfazed about getting beaten outside the off stump. They tried to wear down the bowlers and succeeded. The Indian fast bowlers became a tad impatient and tried to put in extra effort. Boundary balls started to arrive.Umesh Yadav strayed down the leg side and Thirimanne clipped it to the fine leg boundary. Kumar bowed a half-volley and the left-hander caressed it to the cover fence. An on drive to an inswinger was even better.Mathews, on the other hand, was scratchy to start with. A thick edge flew between the slips and gully as Mohammed Shami made one rear. Another one went past the second slip, with the Shami delivery moving late. Short of game time, Mathews was battling hard to get into the groove. He used all his experience. “Coming from an injury layoff, it wasn’t easy to have the same rhythm. I prepared well, but I had to use my experience,” Mathews said after the day’s play.Thirimanne was dropped by Shikhar Dhawan at first slip off Yadav when he was on 27. Sri Lanka were on 70 for two then. The partnership started to swell, threatening to take the game away from the hosts. A seemingly desperate Virat Kohli brought on R Ashwin. Thirimanne promptly dispatched a faster delivery from the offie to the square leg fence. India needed the tea break to rethink.Post-tea, Umesh and Shami fired on all cylinders. Two bowlers at 90 mph, movement and bounce — cricket in the fading light became engrossing. Thirimanne got to his fifty but failed to see through a fiery spell from Yadav. A rising delivery took the outside edge to Kohli at second slip.Mathews got out tamely, after 52 off 94 balls. A slower delivery tempted the batsman to attempt a cover drive and KL Rahul at short cover took an easy catch. It was outside the off stump and in the context of the game, Mathews played a poor shot.A close shave\r\nNiroshan Dickwella and Dinesh Chandimal never looked convincing against pace. The former tried to pull one off Yadav but apparently got a tickle, with Saha running towards his left to complete the catch.The on-field umpire upheld the appeal, but the Snicko didn’t pick a spike and the keeper-batsman survived. The Hot Spot wasn’t part of the DRS.Sri Lanka finished at 165 for four, with bad light once again forcing an early close of play. But Yadav’s spell after tea – 7-1-25-2 – still kept India in the game. Both Shami and Kumar complemented him well.',real
'A top Indian diplomat\'s five-year-old son was briefly held hostage in Durban after armed robbers invaded his official residence on Thursday. Official sources here confirmed the incident but said no physical harm was caused to anyone. India has officially taken up the issue of security for its diplomats with the South African government. According to agency reports, the family of India\'s consul-general in Durban, Shashank Vikram, members of his domestic staff and a visiting teacher were held up at their residence on Innes Road. Among them were two children, aged five and 10. \"They are OK but they were obviously traumatised,\" said consul S K Pandey. \"Nobody suffered physical harm,\" he said. A domestic worker\'s cellphone, which was robbed, could provide clues to the incident of the robbery in the home of India\'s consul-general in Durban, the Independent Online reported. \"A catastrophic lapse in security for such a high-profile diplomatic family is now being investigated at the highest levels after the consul general\'s official residence, India House, in Morningside, was breached for the first time in its long history, and seemingly so easily,\" it said in its report. The robbers reportedly gained entry by derailing the entrance gate, a strategy used often in a spate of brazen robberies recently in affluent suburbs north of Durban. In response to queries on the armed intrusion, MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said, \"Ensuring the safety and security of Indian diplomats/officials posted abroad and their families is a matter of highest priority for us.

'A top Indian diplomat\'s five-year-old son was briefly held hostage in Durban after armed robbers invaded his official residence on Thursday. Official sources here confirmed the incident but said no physical harm was caused to anyone. India has officially taken up the issue of security for its diplomats with the South African government. According to agency reports, the family of India\'s consul-general in Durban, Shashank Vikram, members of his domestic staff and a visiting teacher were held up at their residence on Innes Road. Among them were two children, aged five and 10. \"They are OK but they were obviously traumatised,\" said consul S K Pandey. \"Nobody suffered physical harm,\" he said. A domestic worker\'s cellphone, which was robbed, could provide clues to the incident of the robbery in the home of India\'s consul-general in Durban, the Independent Online reported. \"A catastrophic lapse in security for such a high-profile diplomatic family is now being investigated at the highest levels after the consul general\'s official residence, India House, in Morningside, was breached for the first time in its long history, and seemingly so easily,\" it said in its report. The robbers reportedly gained entry by derailing the entrance gate, a strategy used often in a spate of brazen robberies recently in affluent suburbs north of Durban. In response to queries on the armed intrusion, MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said, \"Ensuring the safety and security of Indian diplomats/officials posted abroad and their families is a matter of highest priority for us. In the context of the incident, we have taken up the matter with the relevant authorities, and investigations are currently ongoing. We expect that the intruders will be arrested soon.

'An Indian-origin pharmacist on trial for the murder of his elderly father by injecting him with a lethal dose of morphine has been freed by a UK judge, who ruled that he had acted out of “mercy and pure compassion”.Bipin Desai had denied the murder charge but admitted to assisting his 85-year-old father Dhirajlal Desai commit suicide at their home in Surrey, south-east England, because he had been depressed and wanted to end his life.“Your acts of assistance were acts of pure compassion and mercy. Your father had a solid and firm wish to die. Being assisted to die would be fulfilling his wish of going to heaven to see his wife and being put out of his misery,” Justice Green told Desai during a sentencing hearing at Guildford Crown Court yesterday.The court heard how Desai’s father had begged daily for help in ending his life after his wife and dog died. Finally, the 59-year-old pharmacist put morphine stolen from his pharmacy into his father’s smoothie in August, 2015.Then he gave his father the drink and kissed him goodnight and goodbye and later injected insulin to speed up the fatal dose.“We have a man who wanted to die, not because he was terribly ill but, sadly, because he had just had enough of life,” Desai’s defence lawyer told the court.Justice Green directed the jury to bring in a not-guilty verdict and handed Desai a nine-month suspended sentence for his assisted suicide plea, which means he would not have to spend any time behind bars as long as he does not breach the court’s conditions.A letter to the judge written by Desai’s wife Dipti was read out in court by their lawyer, which explained that her husband had also tried to kill himself on several occasions.“Since August 2015 our lives have been turned completely upside down and have never been the same for any of us,” she wrote.One of their two sons, Samir, told the court, “My dad is the best person I know. He was left with an impossible choice and chose the road which gave my grandfather peace”.Desai had pleaded guilty to two counts of theft relating to stealing the two drugs, morphine and insulin, from his workplace of Vaughan James Chemist in Farnham but the judge ruled those as trivial.“The thefts are trivial and only form part of the fabric of the wider case. The owner of the pharmacy said in his evidence that you were an honest, respectful and decent man,” the judge noted.After the verdict, Bipin Desai said he now wants to properly grieve for his father. “The past two years have been a time of immense stress for our family and it is a huge relief this ordeal is over,” he said.',real
'TOKYO: The US Navy carrier, the USS Ronald Reagan, conducted three days of drills with a Japanese destroyer and two Indian warships in the Sea of Japan, Japan\'s navy said on Tuesday. The exercise involving five ships, which ended Monday, came amid heightened tension in the region over North Korea\'s ballistic missile and nuclear tests+ and as US President Donald Trump began a 12-day tour of Asia beginning in Japan on Sunday. \"The exercise helped improve fighting skills and deepened cooperation with India,\" Japan\'s Maritime Self Defence Force said in a press release. The 100,000-ton Reagan, which is based in Japan carries around 70 combat aircraft and is the US Navy\'s most powerful warship in Asia.

'INDIANAPOLIS -- An Indiana woman who called off her $30,000 wedding threw a party Saturday for the homeless at the swanky event center she had booked for the reception.Sarah Cummins told the Indianapolis Star she called off the wedding a week ago, but declined to give a reason.She was left with a nonrefundable contract for the Ritz Charles in Carmel and a plated dinner for 170 guests.Cummins says she decided that rather than throw away the food she would bring some purpose to the event and contacted area homeless shelters.A school bus pulled up Saturday from one organization and about a dozen homeless veterans stepped off to join the party. They were greeted by Cummins in a sleeveless top and pastel pants rather than a wedding dress.\"For me, it was an opportunity to let these people know they deserved to be at a place like this just as much as everyone else does,\" Cummins said.Several local businesses and residents donated suits, dresses and other items for the guests to wear.Charlie Allen, who\'s spent three months at a homeless mission, received a donated jacket.\"I didn\'t have a sport coat,\" he said, tugging gently at the lapels. \"I think I look pretty nice in it.\"Three of Cummins seven bridesmaids, along with her mother and aunts, came to support her at the event. Guests dined on bourbon-glazed meatballs, goat cheese and roasted garlic bruschetta, chicken breast with artichokes and Chardonnay cream sauce and wedding cake.Cummins, a 25-year-old Purdue University pharmacy student, said her ex-fiance, Logan Araujo, footed most of the bill for the wedding contract, with Cummins and her parents, along with one of Araujo\'s family friends, paying the rest.Cummins said she is not sure yet what she will do with the wedding dress.\"It\'s too painful to think about.\"',real

The incident involving lawyer Krishna Sarma happened on Sunday wherein her mobile phone was allegedly snatched by a staff to delete certain pictures clicked by her. Regretting the \"unpleasant experience\" of Sarma with its airport staff, IndiGo said, \"based on her complaint, has suspended the two employees involved in the incident pending investigation\".

'NEW DELHI: On the birth centenary of Indira Gandhi, Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Sunday described her as a Prime Minister for whom there was only one religion - that all Indians were equal children of the motherland. The Congress president said Indira Gandhi was \"one of the greatest\" as she fought for secularism and against all those forces seeking to divide the people on the lines of religion and caste. \"For her, as the prime minister, there was one religion, a sacred creed passionately held - that all Indians were equal children of the motherland,\" Sonia Gandhi said at a function at 1, Safdarjung Road, the official residence of the former prime minister. The former prime minister fought not for her personal ascendancy but for her principles and against vested interests, the Congress president said. \"She fought for secularism, against all those forces seeking to divide the Indian people on lines of religion and caste. She gloried in the rich diversity of India, its profound democratic and secular values,\" Sonia Gandhi said. The Congress chief, who along with former president Pranab Mukherjee and ex-prime minister Manmohan Singh, was present at the event, said Indira Gandhi fought for the poor and the weak wherever they were being oppressed and denied their rights and toiled for their material well-being. \"I have heard Indiraji being referred to as the \'Iron Lady\'. But iron was only one of the elements in her character; generosity and humanity were just as prominent traits,\" Sonia Gandhi said. \"She fought, yes - but not for personal ascendancy. She fought for her principles, against vested interests and agendas. She could not tolerate any form of bullying, coercion and unfairness. That was fundamental to her character. That is what inspired her in all her battles -- those she took on and those that she faced,\" the Congress president said. At the event, Manmohan Singh unveiled a special catalogue on Indira Gandhi, bringing out her fond memories. On the occasion, an exhibition on the former prime minister titled \'A Life of Courage\' was organised by the Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust. Sonia Gandhi said in the 16 years that were given to Indira Gandhi to lead the country, she had to confront many challenges, from the endemic problems of combating poverty and inequality to the critical ones of war and terrorism. She faced them all with courage, fortified by her dedication to making India strong, united and prosperous. In all her efforts she was sustained by the faith reposed in her by her fellow countrymen and women, the Congress president said.

'Some years ago, I spent several months studying the official correspondence of P.N. Haksar, who was principal secretary to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi from 1967 to 1973. In his letters and reports, Haksar came across as a man of patriotism and erudition. He deeply loved his country and fervently wished for its progress and prosperity. He was widely read in history and the humanities, and had a serious interest in science and technology as well. At the same time, Haksar was not afflicted at all by self-doubt. Reading his papers, I was impressed, indeed astonished, at how he was so sure of himself while prescribing policies and making appointments in spheres well beyond his domain of expertise.Haksar’s boss — whose birth centenary falls this Sunday — shared both his patriotism and his certitude. Indira Gandhi lived and died for India, and she thought she knew better than any other Indian what was good and best for India. Hence her lack of interest in Parliament, and her barely concealed contempt for the Opposition (this was manifest well before she jailed her opponents during the Emergency). Hence, also, her destruction of the culture of inner-party democracy within the Congress, so that her party, and her cabinet, became entirely subordinated to her will, and whim.The health of a democracy depends on a properly functioning Parliament and a vigorous and effective Opposition. And it depends, as critically, on autonomous and independent public institutions. In the 1950s, ruling party politicians did not determine the allocation of top jobs within the bureaucracy, as well as within regulatory institutions. This changed with the advent of Indira Gandhi, who, actively aided by P.N. Haksar, came up with the idea of the “committed civil servant”, and going further, of the “committed judiciary”. Once, senior public servants in the Government of India were chosen and promoted on the basis of proven competence or track record. Now, whether the prime minister liked or approved of an official also became an important factor in appointments to senior positions.Like Indira Gandhi, Haksar was a Kashmiri Pandit by birth. So were some other key advisors of the prime minister. However, ethnic origin was not really central to career prospects; what mattered more was depth of commitment to the Leader and her ideology. Whether he was Tamil or Bengali, Hindu or Muslim, a “committed” official had to believe in Mrs Gandhi’s brand of state socialism, and tacitly endorse her bypassing of parliamentary procedure. And he had to be utterly loyal to her, even when asked to do things contrary to constitutional practice or the norms and traditions of his office.I do not mean to suggest that we had a fantastically capable civil service before Indira Gandhi became prime minister. In Nehru’s and Shastri’s day, there were officials who were able, focussed and hardworking, as well as officials who were lazy, incompetent and corrupt. But whether good, bad, or indifferent, top officials and judges were appointed and functioned independently of the prime minister. The autonomy of the institution was kept intact, as it must be in a constitutional democracy. It was this that changed with the advent of Indira Gandhi. Now, politics and personality intruded into, and impeded the functioning of, the executive and the judiciary.Once corroded, the autonomy of public institutions could not be restored. After Indira Gandhi’s death, however, the corrosion took different forms. For one thing, it became more decentralised. Later prime ministers were not as powerful as Mrs Gandhi, so individual ministers took to interfering with, and determining, senior appointments. For another, caste and ethnicity began to play a greater role. Personal loyalty to the minister mattered, of course, but it also helped if you shared his caste, religion, language or state.Were this a longer essay, I would provide a more wide-ranging assessment of Indira Gandhi’s career. I would write of her positive contributions, as in the winning of the Bangladesh war, the carrying forward of Shastri’s and C. Subramaniam’s programmes of food security, the establishment of the Indian Space Research Organisation, the promotion of our great craft traditions, and the sponsorship of the successful Festivals of India, soft power at its best. I would also then write of her other negative contributions, as in the further consolidation of the licence-permit-quota raj, and the conversion of the great party of the freedom struggle into a family firm.A short column must have a sharper focus, and the one I have chosen is, I think, extremely pertinent to the present. Unlike Indira Gandhi, Narendra Modi was not born into privilege. He comes from a very different ideological tradition. Yet his political style is markedly similar. Like Indira Gandhi, he dislikes and suspects an independent media; and rarely gives interviews or entertains difficult questions in public. Like her, he does not place a high value on parliamentary debate, and he can be contemptuous of the Opposition (consider his recent characterisation of the Congress as “termites” to be exterminated). Like her, he absolutely dominates his cabinet and party. Like her, when it comes to appointing senior officials, he values personal as well as ideological loyalty — hence the fact, surely not a coincidence, that so many top jobs in the Government of India have recently gone to Gujarat cadre officers.',real

'SEOUL: Parasitic worms found in a North Korean soldier, critically injured during a desperate defection+ , highlight nutrition and hygiene problems that experts say have plagued the isolated country for decades. At a briefing on Wednesday, lead surgeon Lee Cook-jong displayed photos showing dozens of flesh-coloured parasites - including one 27 cm (10.6 in) long - removed from the wounded soldier\'s digestive tract during a series of surgeries to save his life. \"In my over 20 year-long career as a surgeon, I have only seen something like this in a textbook,\" Lee said. The parasites, along with kernels of corn in his stomach, may confirm what many experts and previous defectors have described about the food and hygiene situation for many North Koreans. \"Although we do not have solid figures showing health conditions of North Korea, medical experts assume that parasite infection problems and serious health issues have been prevalent in the country,\" said Choi Min-Ho, a professor at Seoul National University College of Medicine who specialises in parasites. The soldier\'s condition was \"not surprising at all considering the north\'s hygiene and parasite problems,\" he said. The soldier was flown by helicopter to hospital on Monday after his dramatic escape to South Korea in a hail of bullets fired by North Korean soldiers. He is believed to be an army staff sergeant in his mid-20s who was stationed in the Joint Security Area in the United Nations truce village of Panmunjom, according to Kim Byung-kee, a lawmaker of South Korea\'s ruling party, briefed by the National Intelligence Service. North Korea has not commented on the defection. While the contents of the soldier\'s stomach don\'t necessarily reflect the population as a whole, his status as a soldier - with an elite assignment - would indicate he would at least be as well nourished as an average North Korean. He was shot in his buttocks, armpit, back shoulder and knee among other wounds, according to the hospital where the soldier is being treated. \'The best fertiliser\' Parasitic worms were also once common in South Korea 40 to 50 years ago, Lee noted during his briefing, but have all but disappeared as economic conditions greatly improved. Other doctors have also described removing various types of worms and parasites from North Korean defectors. Their continued prevalence north of the heavily fortified border that divides the two Koreas could be in part tied to the use of human excrement, often called \"night soil.\" \"Chemical fertiliser was supplied by the state until the 1970s, but from the early 1980s, production started to decrease,\" said Lee Min-bok, a North Korean agriculture expert who defected to South Korea in 1995. \"By the 1990s, the state could not supply it anymore, so farmers started to use a lot of night soil instead.\" In 2014, supreme leader Kim Jong Un personally urged farmers to use human faeces, along with animal waste and organic compost, to fertilise their fields. A lack of livestock, however, made it difficult to find animal waste, said Lee, the agriculture expert. Even harder to overcome, he said, is the view of night soil as the \"best fertiliser in North Korea,\" despite the risk of worms and parasites. \"Vegetables grown in it are considered more delicious than others,\" Lee said. Limited diets The medical briefing described the wounded soldier as being 170 cm (5 feet 5 inches) and 60 kg (132 pounds) with his stomach containing corn. It\'s a staple grain that more North Koreans may be relying on in the wake of what the United Nations has called the worst drought since 2001. Imported corn, which is less preferred but cheaper to obtain than rice, has tended to increase in years when North Koreans are more worried about their seasonal harvests. Between January and September this year, China exported nearly 49,000 tonnes of corn to North Korea, compared to only 3,125 tonnes in all of 2016, according to data released by Beijing. Despite the drought and international sanctions over Pyongyang\'s nuclear programme, the cost of corn and rice has remained relatively stable, according to a Reuters analysis of market data collected by the defector-run Daily NK website. Since the 1990s, when government rations failed to prevent a famine hitting the country, North Koreans have gradually turned to markets and other private means to feed themselves. The World Food Programme says a quarter of North Korean children 6-59 months old, who attend nurseries that the organisation assists, suffer from chronic malnutrition. On average North Koreans are less nourished than their southern neighbours. The WFP says around one in four children have grown less tall than their South Korean counterparts. A study from 2009 said pre-school children in the North were up to 13 cm (5 inches) shorter and up to 7 kg (15 pounds) lighter than those brought up in the South. \"The main issue in DPRK is a monotonous diet - mainly rice/maize, kimchi and bean paste - lacking in essential fats and protein,\" the WFP told Reuters in a statement last month.

Some three decades ago, lawyers had an unwritten code fixing a maximum fee limit per hearing in the Supreme Court and the High Court. This rule was broken by some senior lawyers who insisted that they would charge whatever they deemed fit. Now sky is the limit as far as legal fees are concerned. Often, even when the senior counsel does not show up in court, the poor client still has to cough up. Payments are often made in cash.Elephantine exerciseThe Income Tax raids on Sasikala and her nephew T T V Dinakaran were aptly named Operation Elephant.

But she mysteriously lost out each time. Initially, her name was proposed from the Rajya Sabha nominated category but was dropped at the last minute.

Kalam in turn said the PM had requested him not to sign on the file as a senior woman ministerial colleague had reservations. Then, Haryana CM Om Prakash Chautala gave the nomination to the very person who had egged Jaya on to try for the same seat.

'BERNE/NEW DELHI: Paving the way for India to get instant access to details on Indians with Swiss accounts, a key parliamentary panel in Switzerland has approved an automatic information exchange pact between the two countries. The Commission for Economic Affairs and Taxes of the Council of States approved the proposed pact with India as also with 40 other countries, but suggested strengthening the provisions for individual legal claims. It has asked the Swiss government to submit to Parliament an amendment \"to strengthen concrete individual legal protection and to ensure that no exchange of information can take place for individual cases where a violation of essential legal claims is likely\", as per the minutes of its last meeting on November 2. The proposal will now be submitted for approval from the upper chamber of Swiss Parliament. The pact will help provide a continuous access to details about alleged black money hoarders in once-all-secret Swiss banks. The information that could be exchanged under this framework would include account number, name, address, date of birth, tax identification number, interest, dividend, receipts from insurance policies, credit balance in accounts and proceeds from sale of financial assets. The exchange will work like this - If an Indian has a bank account in Switzerland, the bank concerned will disclose the financial account data to authorities there; the Swiss authority will forward the information to its peer in India who can then examine the person\'s details.

'NEW DELHI: Even as Indian agencies and J&K police verify the alleged Islamic State claim owning up the November 17 attack in Srinagar that killed a J&K policeman, officials doubt any direct involvement though they are concerned over the outfit\'s capability to attract self-radicalised recruits. \"IS does not have a presence or any resources in Kashmir to carry out an attack, even though its online propaganda may be followed by the Valley\'s youth. It is more likely that an IS franchise or Pakistan-based elements influenced or owing allegiance to IS could be involved. However, this too needs to be verified,\" a senior intelligence operative told TOI. The officer added that while the IS may not have planned, financed or deployed its men for such an attack, which it has claimed to be its first strike in J&K, the outfit may be seeing this as propaganda to rope in Kashmiri youth and promote their radicalisation. \"As long as IS is making its presence felt in Pakistan, we are not bothered. But if these groups start getting to Kashmir, it is a cause for worry,\" the official said. According to sources, the IS claiming responsibility for the Zakura attack also seems to fit into the global pattern of the outfit owning up to any lone-wolf or jihadi attack in non-IS territory, whether or not there exist any linkages, just to make its presence felt globally. \"For example, IS owned up to Las Vegas shooting though the US investigators are yet to find an IS link. It has similarly claimed responsibility for the July 1 attack last year at a Dhaka eatery, even as investigators in Bangladesh insisted that the attack was carried out by those linked to terrorists affiliated to the local outfit Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen.

'* Analysts say the election is crucial for India, as it is a litmus test for the support it enjoys in the world body where New Delhi has been campaigning for reforms, including for a permanent seat in the powerful UN Security Council+ . * A win for Bhandari will also be a measure of the backing that India enjoys in the UN General Assembly, said former foreign secretary Kanwal Sibal, to PTI. * \"There is an element of prestige to have an Indian elected to such a position,\" said Shashi Tharoor, Congress party MP and former UN undersecretary general. Taking to Twitter to support Bhandari, Tharoor said, \"India is a country of consequence and weight in the world.\" * Bhandari\'s election is also important because India, earlier this year, took Pakistan to the ICJ to seek consular access to Kulbhushan Jadhav, who has been in Pakistani custody over allegations of being an \"Indian spy\". The final judgment on that will be delivered in December. Pakistan has recently appointed an ad-hoc judge to the ICJ for the case. If Bhandari loses, India will be without its own judge in the court. Jadhav has been sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court. * Bhandari\'s opponent in voting for the last seat at the ICJ is Britain\'s Christopher Greenwood. The contest pitches a declining UK and a rising India in a high-voltage diplomatic battle. It demonstrates the inexorable shift of power to countries like India and the extreme reluctance of the ancien regime to accept the change. The world is watching. * Congress MP Tharoor - an alumnus of the UN system - says the election is no longer about the judge or the country she hails from, but about the UN General Assembly standing up against a member of a privileged club who has lost comprehensively among the members at large but still leads 9-6 in the Security Council. What he\'s referring to is the fact that in successive rounds of elections spread over two days in the last two weeks, Bhandari, 70, enjoyed nearly two- third majority in the 193-member General Assembly. Greenwood, 62, received nine votes as against six by Bhandari in the Security Council. As per ICJ rules, the candidates need to gain a majority in both the General assembly and Security Council to be declared elected. * Also at stake for India and the world is the fact this contest is ultimately about the idea of justice, of equality and fairness. \"It is about the future we envisage for the United Nations and the conduct of multilateralism. The time for reform is now. I call on SC members to vote for India\'s candidate,\" said Tharoor.

'CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- A newly discovered object from another star system that\'s passing through ours is shaped like a giant pink fire extinguisher.That\'s the word this week from astronomers who have been observing this first-ever confirmed interstellar visitor.\"I\'m surprised by the elongated shape -- nobody expected that,\" said astronomer David Jewitt of the University of California, Los Angeles, who led the observation team that reported on the characteristics.Scientists are certain this asteroid or comet originated outside our solar system. First spotted last month by the Pan-STARRS telescope in Hawaii, it will stick around for another few years before departing our sun\'s neighborhood.Jewitt and his international team observed the object for five nights in late October using the Nordic Optical Telescope in the Canary Islands and the Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson, Arizona.At approximately 100 feet by 100 feet by 600 feet, the object has proportions roughly similar to a fire extinguisher -- though not nearly as red, Jewitt said Thursday. The slightly red hue -- specifically pale pink -- and varying brightness are remarkably similar to asteroids in our own solar system, he noted.Astronomer Jayadev Rajagopal said in an email that it was exciting to point the Arizona telescope at such a tiny object \"which, for all we know, has been traveling through the vast emptiness of space for millions of years.\"\"And then by luck passes close enough for me to be able to see it that night!\"The object is so faint and so fast -- it\'s zooming through the solar system at 40,000 mph -- it\'s unlikely amateur astronomers will see it.In a paper to the Astrophysical Journal Letters, the scientists report that our solar system could be packed with 10,000 such interstellar travelers at any given time. It takes 10 years to cross our solar system, providing plenty of future viewing opportunities, the scientists said.Trillions of objects from other star systems could have passed our way over the eons, according to Jewitt.It suggests our solar system ejected its own share of asteroids and comets as the large outer planets -- Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune -- formed.Why did it take so long to nail the first interstellar wanderer?\"Space is big and our eyes are weak,\" Jewitt explained via email.Anticipating more such discoveries, the International Astronomical Union already has approved a new designation for cosmic interlopers. They get an \"I\'\' for interstellar in their string of letters and numbers. The group also has approved a name for this object: Oumuamua which in Hawaiian means a messenger from afar arriving first.',real

'IN A major breakthrough for security forces in Kashmir, six “foreign” militants, including the nephew of Lashkar-e-Toiba chief and alleged mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai attacks Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, were killed in a gunbattle on Saturday in north Kashmir’s Hajin area.Officials said the operation also resulted in the death of an IAF Garud commando and injuries to a soldier from 13 Rashtriya Rifles. J&K DGP S P Vaid said, “Six LeT terrorists including two commanders, Mehmood and Zargam, were eliminated, and weapons and ammunition recovered from them.’’Vaid confirmed that one of the militants killed was Owaid alias Osama, 25, the son of Lakhvi’s brother Zaki-ur-Rehman Makki. Police sources said Owaid had entered the Valley last year through Kupwara or Gurez, along with a group of militants. He was active in north Kashmir before zeroing in on the Hajin area this year, they said.Another of the militants killed was identified as Mehmood Bhai, the in-charge of LeT operations in north Kashmir and operating in the Hajin area over the last year. Police and the Army had launched several operations in Hajin and Bandipore to trap Mehmood and other LeT militants active there. Sources said that a third militant who was killed, Zargam, was active in the Ganderbal area. Mehmood and Zargam are believed to have been active in the Valley since 2015.Police are trying to establish the identities of the three other militants killed. The Garud commando, who died in the gunbattle, has been identified as Corporal Jyoti Prakash Nirala, 31, from Badiladih village in Bihar’s Rohtas district. He is survived by his wife and a three-year-old daughter.Over the last 10 days, J&K Police and Rashtriya Rifles had launched several “cordon and search” operations in Hajin and adjacent villages after receiving inputs about the movement of foreign militants in the area. On Saturday afternoon, officials said, the Special Operation Group of J&K Police and 13 RR established a cordon around Chandergeer village, 5 km from Hajin town. As the forces started moving in, the militants came out firing from a house.The Garud commando died in the gunbattle that ensued before all the six militants were killed. Police sources said the militants may have gathered in the house for a meeting. Defence spokesperon Col Rajesh Kalia told The Indian Express that the operation was launched jointly by 13 RR and J&K Police after specific information about militant presence in the area was received.The Indian Express had reported on September 21 that Owaid alias Osama was the third member of Lakhvi’s family to join the LeT’s ranks and be part of its operations in Kashmir. His elder brother Musaib was killed in an encounter in the Hajin area of Bandipore district in January this year. In 2007, Lakhvi’s 20-year-old son Mohammad Qasim was killed in a gunbattle with the Army and J&K police.In the first week of November, a nephew of Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar was killed in Aglar village along with another local militant, with forces recovering a US-made M4 rifle from the encounter site. This is the first time that two close relatives of Pakistan-based commanders of LeT and JeM were killed by security forces in a month.',real
'The Jammu and Kashmir High Court on Saturday admitted a petition seeking further investigation into the killing of 19 civilians in Sailan village of Poonch 19 years ago. The families of the victims have sought further probe after the CBI closed the case saying that the families were “untruthful”. Acting on the petition filed by the victims’ families, challenging the CBI’s closure report, the court issued notice to the CBI asking it to respond. The case has been reopened for the second time by the court.On the intervening night of August 3 and 4 in 1998, 19 civilians — 13 females and 6 males — were killed inside their homes at point blank range in Sailan. Eleven of them were children. The families alleged that four Special Police Officers (SPOs) of J&K Police and personnel of 9 Para battalion of the Army were responsible for the killings. They alleged that the killers were led by Major Guarav Rishi of Army’s 9 Para. The families had been accusing J&K Police of covering up the massacre.In 2011, the families approached the high court seeking reopening of the case. In 2012, the HC directed the CBI to reinvestigate. On August 27, 2015, the CBI filed a closure report saying the families were not “truthful”. Two years later, the CBI court accepted the investigations.The families again approached the HC challenging the order of the CBI court. They argued that the CBI court ignored the material evidence and that its decision was “arbitrary and perverse”. “The (CBI court) order has resulted in serious miscarriage of justice,” said a spokesman of Jammu and Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society (JKCCS), which is helping the families in the legal fight. “The CBI court accepted the conclusions of CBI and failed to appreciate the detailed submissions made by the family members of the victims that clearly indict the state forces for the crime.”',real

'TOKYO: A Japanese railway operator has issued a deep apology for the \"tremendous nuisance\" caused by a train departing 20 seconds early, surprising even a nation renowned for both punctuality and politeness. The Tsukuba Express train linking Tokyo and the capital\'s northern suburbs pulled out of Minami Nagareyama Station at 9:44:20 instead of 9:44:40. \"We deeply apologise for causing tremendous nuisance to customers,\" said the Tsukuba Express company. \"There was no complaint from customers over this incident,\" said the firm, which added that no one missed the train due to the premature departure. Japanese railway services, including shinkansen bullet trains, are famous for their world-beating punctuality. Even the slightest delay prompts an effusive apology from the train guard, which often lasts longer than the hold-up itself. With trains running the same route every few minutes to cope with huge numbers of passengers, even brief delays can back up the whole network causing overcrowding. Stations in Toyko employ dozens of staff -- with their famous white gloves -- to ensure the prompt departure of trains and to manage the crush during rush hour. The bullet trains in Japan are also famed for their customer service, with one offering passengers an onboard footbath to soothe their travelling woes. The train firm said it was \"surprised\" by the attention the story was getting, saying: \"We have issued similar apologies for trains that departed earlier than scheduled before.\" A spokesman told AFP the apology was issued because strict safety procedures were not followed. \"What matters is not the 20 seconds... The point is that our formal procedure should be this: A sound rings 15 seconds before the departure, followed by an announcement asking for caution due to the closing doors, and then the doors shut,\" he said. Lax management could cause safety problems in the future, the spokesman said. \"There are sometimes passengers who try to jump on the train... they could be caught in doors\" if the doors shut without warning, he said. But the apology had several social media users scratching their heads. \"This is surprising even to Japanese,\" said one Twitter user. \"A weird country in which a 20-second difference prompts a sincere apology while faking quality data on aluminium and steel products or misconduct on car check-ups are done just like that,\" another tweet read. This was a reference to a recent string of corporate scandals that has floored the reputation of Japan Inc. Car giants Nissan and Subaru have admitted that uncertified staff had inspected vehicles while Kobe Steel has been embroiled in a quality data-faking scandal.

'NEW DELHI: Judges from 12 high courts brainstormed with experts from the finance ministry on grey areas in the new goods and services tax (GST) regime and possible litigation related to it at a recent judicial conference at the Bhopal-based National Judicial Academy. At least 20 HC judges participated in the deliberations where they were briefed by senior officials from the Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC) on the new tax system. \'Potential areas of conflict and litigation under GST\' and \'Comparative analysis of concepts: GST vis-a-vis central excise, service tax and VAT\' were some of the topics discussed at the meeting. Those who participated included judges from the HCs of Allahabad, Hyderabad, Bombay, Calcutta, Delhi, Gujarat, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh and Madras. Resource persons included officials from GST intelligence unit and CBEC. Besides finance ministry, CBEC officials gave presentation on difficulties faced by field formations. The National Judicial Academy has been organising such conferences of judicial officers and judges to sensitise them about the new tax regime and prepare them for implementation of the new tax laws. Interpretation of the new tax laws are important in view of the complex nature of taxation. For instance, the Delhi HC had asked the Centre that if \'bindi\', \'sindoor\' and \'kajal\' were kept out of the ambit of GST, why could sanitary napkins not be exempted. A bench of acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar said sanitary napkins were necessity items and there could not be any explanation for taxing them and exempting other items by bringing them in the category of necessity. The court also expressed unhappiness over absence of any women in the 31-member GST Council. The court was hearing a petition challenging the levy of 12\% GST on sanitary napkins.

'Activist and former BJP and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Kanu Kalsariya filed his nomination from Mahuva Assembly constituency in Bhavnagar district as an Independent even as the ruling BJP announced to field its sitting MLA Bhavna Makwana’s husband Raghavaji as its candidate from the seat on Friday. This marks return of Kalsariya to his old backyard of Mahuva after trying to seek support of voters in neighbouring Gariyadhar Assembly constituency in 2012.Accompanied by scores of his supporters, Kalsariya filed his nomination papers with the office of returning officer of Mahuva as an Independent candidate on Friday. This is for the fifth time that Kalsariya, who is a general surgeon, has jumped in the fray for an Assembly constituency. He had won from Mahuva seat as a BJP candidate in 1998, 2002 and 2007. He had contested the 2012 election from Gariyadhar as an Independent but had lost. He had also lost Lok Sabha election from Rajkot as candidate of Aam Aadmi Party in 2014.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\tif(typeof(jQuery)==\"function\"){(function($){$.fn.fitVids=function(){}})(jQuery)};\r\n\t\t\t\tjwplayer(\'jwplayer_ugwZjtaH_xe0BVfqu_div\').setup(\r\n\t\t\t\t{\"playlist\":\"http:\\/\\/vidshare.indianexpress.com\\/jw6\\/ugwZjtaH.xml\"}\r\n\t\t\t);\r\n\t\t\r\nKalsariya had hit headlines in 2008-09 when he opposed a proposed cement plant of Nirma. He went against the line of the BJP government in the state and sided with farmers of his constituency who were opposing the plant on the grounds that it was proposed to be built on a water-body. The matter had reached the Gujarat High Court and eventually Nirma had shelved its plans.After falling foul with the BJP, Kalsariya had floated Sadbhavana Manch in the 2012 Assembly election and the group had fought from five seats spread in Bhavanagar and Amreli districts. However, the group had failed to open its account as Kalsariya himself lost from Gariyadhar seat. In fact, he had come third after Congress in the seat won by the BJP. In the process, the doctor, who is running two charitable hospitals in Mahuva also lost his backyard of Mahuva to Bharati Makwana of BJP.Later on he had joined AAP and was made its convenor for Gujarat. He contested the 2014 Lok Sabha poll as AAP candidate from Bhavnagar but lost out to Bharati Shiyal of BJP.But 62-year-old Kalsariya says he has learnt his lessons. “Leaving my area of Mahuva and instead contesting from Gariyadhar seat was a blunder. May be, I was overconfident. In the Lok Sabha election, those close to me asked me not to contest. But AAP leadership told me that if I would not contest, nobody else will contest in Gujarat.

Being Independent candidate, I will also have full liberty to serve people of my constituency. On top of this, AAP chief Aravind Kejriwal was of the view that the party should not field candidates from Mahuva. Therefore, I had told them in advance that I intend to contest the election anyway.”Kalsariya also said that he may extend support to Congress. “Congress is emerging as the only option which can defeat the BJP. So, I will extend support to Congress provided it doesn’t field its candidate in Mahuva seat,” he said.Meanwhile, the BJP announced Raghavji Makwana as its candidate for the the December 9 poll. Makwana is husband of sitting BJP MLA from Mahuva, Bhavna Makwana. He is also leader of opposition in Congress-ruled Bhavnagar districtd panchayat besides holding the post of vice-president of Bhavnagar district unit of the BJP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\tif(typeof(jQuery)==\"function\"){(function($){$.fn.fitVids=function(){}})(jQuery)};\r\n\t\t\t\tjwplayer(\'jwplayer_IZpEut0j_xe0BVfqu_div\').setup(\r\n\t\t\t\t{\"playlist\":\"http:\\/\\/vidshare.indianexpress.com\\/jw6\\/IZpEut0j.xml\"}\r\n\t\t\t);\r\n\t\t\r\nHowever, soon after Raghavji was declared BJP candidate for Mahuva, former president of Mahuva municipality, Bipin Sanghavi resigned from the saffron party.

'NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday allowed Karti Chidambaram to go to United Kingdom from December 1 to 10 to get his daughter admitted to Cambridge University but directed him to give an undertaking that he would return to face probe in a pay-off case registered against him by the CBI. Chidambaram was barred from leaving the country as CBI had issued \'Look Out Circular\' against him on June 16. He had since been fighting a legal battle against the investigative agency. Although the Madras HC had stayed the LOC, the order was overruled by the apex court. The CBI has alleged that Karti had received commission in irregular FIPB approval for foreign investment to INX Media in 2007, when his father P Chidambaram was the Union finance minister. As Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the CBI, said that Karti could be allowed to go abroad for few days, a bench of Chief Justice Dipak Mishra and Justices A M Khanwilkar permitted him to leave the country. \"Keeping in view the note submitted by Additional Solicitor General wherein he has expressed that he has taken instructions for allowing Karti P Chidambaram to leave the country on certain terms and conditions, it is directed that he is permitted to go to United Kingdom for the purpose of admitting his daughter during December 1 to December 10 and he shall file an affidavit with regard to grant or non-grant of admission after his return before this court,\" the bench said. \"Additionally, he shall file an undertaking within three days indicating his flight details and that he will come back by December 10. Needless to say, if the undertaking is not complied with, he shall face such consequences as may be deemed fit and proper,\" the bench said, making it clear that Karti will have to face contempt proceedings he fails to return. The bench, after perusing CBI\'s confidential probe report against Karti, had said that he could be allowed to go abroad for few days and had sought response from the agency which had expressed apprehension that he might try to tamper with the evidences and might not come back if allowed to go abroad.

'NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday conditionally allowed Karti Chidambara, son of Congress leader P Chidambaram, to visit UK from December 1 to December 10 for his daughter\'s admission at a university there. A bench comprising Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud asked Karti Chidambaram to file an undertaking before it within three days, giving assurance that he will abide by the timeline and return to India on the expiry of the period. Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the CBI, submitted a note to the court in response to its query on the probe agency\'s stand on Karti Chidambaram\'s plea seeking to go abroad. The bench, however, made it clear that its order, permitting Karti Chidambaram to go abroad, will not be cited before any court of law as precedent. A lookout notice issued by the CBI on July 18 prevents Karti from travelling abroad without the investigating agency\'s permission. The CBI had on September 1 told the top court that there were \"good, cogent\" reasons for issuing the lookout notice. Earlier, the apex court had said that Karti Chidambaram would not be allowed to leave India without subjecting himself to investigation in the case. The court had then stayed the high court order putting on hold the lookout notice against Karti Chidambaram. On November 9, the Supreme Court had asked the CBI to apprise it of its stand on allowing the request of Karti Chidambaram to go abroad for a few days. The CBI FIR, lodged on May 15, had alleged irregularities in Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) clearance to INX Media for receiving overseas funds to the tune of Rs 305 crore in 2007 when Karti\'s father P.

'JAMMU: The Centre has taken note of reports about global terror group ISIS claiming an attack in the Kashmir Valley that left a police officer dead, Union minister Jitendra Singh said adding that the future course of action would be adopted after taking an appropriate view. The minister of state in the prime minister\'s office also said that the recent \"back to back\" successes achieved against terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir was the result of the free hand given to security forces to wipe out the nearly three-decade-old militancy which is in its \"last phase\". Singh was asked about the ISIS claiming its first terror attack in Kashmir through its propaganda wing, Amaq news agency. \"The government has taken cognisance of inputs and the concerned agencies, the ministry of home affairs and the security agencies, are taking an appropriate view and will adopt the future course of action accordingly,\" he told reporters here. Three militants in a car opened fire on a police team at Zakura crossing on the Srinagar-Ganderbal road, killing Sub- Inspector Imran Tak and injuring a special police officer (SPO) on Friday. The retaliatory action left a most wanted local militant dead, whose body was wrapped in ISIS flag during the funeral procession. Responding to a question about the killing of six Pakistani militants, including the nephew of Mumbai attack mastermind Zaki-ur Rehman Lakhvi, in an encounter in Bandipora district on Saturday, Singh said this was the result of the \"decisive initiative\" taken by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi led Union government. \"The free hand given to security forces to perform with professional freedom is behind such back to back successes. This is possibly the last phase of militancy in Kashmir,\" he said. The minister said that he had been saying for the last several months that this was the last phase of terrorism in the state but there were people who were not taking the statement seriously. \"The lifespan of any commander has been reduced to a few weeks - 10 to 15 weeks. Once a commander is appointed, the second is being kept ready to take over. The time has gone when they used to live for years,\" he said. He said it was for the first time in the last quarter of a century that there is a government in place in New Delhi which is working on the principle of clarity, conviction and consistency and does not interfere with the professional work being done by security forces. Lauding the local police, he said the manner in which the special operations group performed is a testimony to the fact that if given right opportunity without intimidation, the force is capable of doing wonders. On the surrender of the college student and footballer Majid Arshid, who had joined the LeT a week ago, Singh said the change was already there but it was just a veil of fear which was holding them back. \"Once the Modi government decided to initiate decisive action, this veil of fear has been taken away and the boys and girls are feeling free enough to come forward and express their aspirations,\" he said. He said what Pakistan was doing has never been a secret but what is different today is that the common man in Kashmir, particularly the youth, is now ready to join the mainstream development journey led by Modi. \"This change started actually two years ago and that is the reason today this year also we have 19 young boys and girls qualifying for the IITs,\" he said. On Pakistan\'s role in fomenting terror, Singh said that all the information was already available but it was only Pakistan that was in a denial mode. \"But what has changed now in the past few months is that countries which were hesitant to accept India\'s viewpoint for reasons of their own are now constrained to accept India\'s viewpoint as far as terror and perpetration of terrorism from Pakistan soil is concerned. Pakistan also now feels constrained to no longer continue in denial mode,\" he said.

'HYDERABAD: Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR) has decided to launch a nationwide agitation to seek power for state governments to decide on reservations for Muslims, tribals and other backward classes (OBCs). KCR will organise a dharna in Delhi to press the demand, and is mobilising support from other states that have raised similar demands. The TRS government wants to increase reservations to 62\% - much beyond the SC-imposed 50\% cap - and has sought its inclusion in the Constitution\'s Ninth Schedule to thwart legal challenge. \"KCR has already spoken to the chief ministers of Rajasthan and Maharashtra on the issue. They have also supported the cause. He is planning to sit on a dharna at Jantar Mantar, questioning the Centre\'s bias in allowing state governments to raise quota,\" said a Telangana minister. The CM is holding talks with MPs of Nationalist Congress Party, Trinamool Congress, BJD, JD(U) and JD(S). KCR wants to raise the quota for Muslims from 4\% to 12\% and the state assembly has already passed a resolution. He\'s also calling for a hike in reservations for Scheduled Tribes from 6\% to 10\%, based on the state\'s tribal population. Currently, Telangana also provides 15\% reservation to SCs and 25\% to OBCs under four categories labelled A, B, C and D. In 2007, the Y S Rajasekhara Reddy government of united Andhra Pradesh had enacted a law providing a 4\% quota to economically backward Muslims by creating a separate group, \'E\', under the OBC category, exclusively for minorities. Under this system, 14 classes of Muslims were listed as OBCs, taking the total quota strength to 50\%. However, it was challenged in court and the case is pending before the Supreme Court. \"While Tamil Nadu was allowed 69\% reservations, how can the Centre deny the same to Telangana? When all north-eastern states are enjoying more than 50\% reservations for STs, why not Telangana, where tribal population is more than 10\%?\" asked state minister T N Rao. KCR is preparing a road map to take the issue to the national level and build a forum. Since Rajasthan and Karnataka are also demanding more quota, he is trying to build a platform to mount pressure on the NDA government. Rajasthan has been trying to come out with ways to raise reservations for Gujjars, Haryana for Jats and Gujarat for Patidars. BJP\'s manifesto in UP promised 90\% job reservations for locals and Karnataka is planning a 100\% quota for Kannadigas in non-IT, non-BT blue-collar jobs, and its CM has said he proposes to bring a law to provide 70\% quota to SC, ST, OBCs in the state and push for its inclusion in the Ninth Schedule.

'Sport boasts of glorious tales of overcoming adversity: economic and social hardships, physical impediments, parental opposition, geography and gender. Kidambi Srikanth has not necessarily encountered those. All he dreads is travel — a prerequisite for international sport.Talk of that encumbrance brings a grimace to his face, and leads him to pinch his nose and scrunch his eyes. It might never stop him from ruling badminton some day in the future but, suffice to say, he isn’t the sea-faring Popeye smacking at feathered birds. So, Srikanth will brood a bit and sulk some more before he sets off on yet another round of tournaments.Everyone close to him — his parents, brother Nandagopal, coach P Gopichand and physio Kiran Challagunda — knows that once he fetches up on court in any part of the world, he is capable of staking claim to the title. Opponents and rival coaches remain wary of the 24-year-old hitting a purple patch, shredding reputations of Olympic and World Championship-proportions (he is yet to win those), and playing five sublime matches in a week to pick Super Series championships (he does have six of those).The women, Saina Nehwal and PV Sindhu, have taken off over the last decade; the men now need to catch up and the bets are on Srikanth to deliver the big medals. But how to get this notoriously reticent man cracking (and packing) remains a challenge.We catch him on a particularly bad day in Hyderabad soon after the World Championships. “I’m travelling so much, I have started hating it. I love being at one place,” he mutters. This cribbing comes after he’s made it to the finals of the Singapore, Indonesia and Australian Opens, winning two of those. So, you know he will complain, then pack his bags and push off to eventually win more titles. He promptly claims the Denmark Open a few weeks later — and the French Open last Sunday. In a span of three months, he has travelled and triumphed across three continents. “I didn’t get time to celebrate because I had to take an immediate flight to Paris. I’ll celebrate after I go back to Hyderabad,” he says. Older brother Nandagopal chuckles as he predicts what shape that party will take — the tight-knit family of four, parents and two sons, eating out at a quiet restaurant.Srikanth might have a 100 visa stamps on his passports, but he insists his idea of a perfect holiday is running back home. “I stay away from home so much. Every time I get time, I want to go home,” he had said before coach Gopichand asked his parents to relocate to Hyderabad from Guntur, a little startled by Srikanth’s bouts of homesickness. The family took up a villa in Gachibowli, reuniting almost after a decade of the boys camping out at badminton academies across the state — Khammam, Guntur, Vijayawada and Hyderabad.Srikanth craved Indian food wherever he travelled, and home food when he was at Hyderabad training at the Pullela Gopichand Badminton Academy. “I love to sit back home, relax with a few friends and joke about small things. I enjoy doing nothing,” he says.For all that searing ambition he is expected to feel, Srikanth’s career had started as “timepass”. He recalls the usual fights with brother Nandu for the TV remote and the front seat, but the two were thick and Srikanth followed the older sibling into badminton. His father was a reasonably well-off land-owning farmer in Guntur (then a part of Andhra Pradesh), and though the parents insisted that studies and sport ought to get equal attention, Srikanth was gravitating towards badminton. “I watched the 2001 All England final, the first-ever sport I watched. To be frank, I didn’t know anything about badminton’s history. I only got to know it when I turned pro,” he says.Gopichand would visit Guntur where Srikanth was training under coach Sudhakar Reddy. He was doing well but his laidback attitude meant there was no spark that could prompt Gopichand to take him on board. Nandagopal had shown early signs of what is now a left-handed full-throttle backhand jump smash and left for Hyderabad, while the parents had to step in to ensure Srikanth could follow at the age of 15.“Nandu was senior in everything, even in getting serious about the sport. I started going to the stadium and slowly began enjoying it. Doubles was so different from singles, I used to like it, and win so much,” he recalls. He struck up a long partnership and friendship with another player, Hema Nagendra Babu.“Gopi Sir is a big mentor. He’s not friendly or anything, but there’s just great communication with him. In my junior years, he would shout and get angry because of how I was,” he says. Reluctant is what he was. Or living in a world of his own.Babu remembers a sleepless Srikanth waking up in the middle of the night to narrate his plans. Of becoming a film director. “He would talk about the scenes he would direct in the movies he’d make — not who the hero or heroine would be, but what the shot would look like and where the camera would be,” he says. Deeply impressed by Telugu director Sekhar Kammula, who made the hit Happy Days in 2007, Srikanth would describe entire scenes and storylines. “He used to love imagining screenplays based on what happened at the academy,” he says. Till recently, they would laugh away, casting characters from the academy in Bahubali roles and make merry.Actually, there were three — Srikanth, Babu and Gopi Raju — living in a mini bachelor’s pad. “Room 107 was memorable. It used to be untidy, with clothes thrown all around and cleaned only when Gopi bhaiyya or his mother came for inspections. There was a camera placed right outside,” Babu recalls. It was this camera that once caught their mischief. The tell-tale sign was two empty boxes, with the Domino’s pizzas inside polished off. “We used to successfully order biryani late at night without anyone knowing because Gopi bhaiyya would sleep at 9. The camera caught the empty pizza boxes, and he was furious,” he says.Srikanth and his buddies would be ordered to fetch up on court at 4.30 the next morning as punishment and give multi-shuttle feeding practice to juniors, followed by their own training without a break for six hours. “But he liked our discipline because we never went out or drank and were generally responsible,” Babu says.Room 107 saw other capers too. Srikanth would round up juniors from the academy for a game of cricket in the room. “He would make them bat and bowl because he used to love fielding. He was very good at it,” he says. Srikanth’s big passion back then was carrom. They would play all-nighters, and even had a hot bulb fixed over the table, which would light up just the board.By now, Srikanth, playing at the net, was trading in pushes and half-smashes, adding strength and speed to his defence and strokes. A smash from the back court began to take shape as he started focussing on singles. “I didn’t stick to one partner after Srikanth,” says Babu, who would go on to join the Railways in 2014.It took Gopichand some time and goading — in the middle of shepherding careers of Nehwal, Sindhu and P Kashyap — to steer Srikanth towards singles. The Hyderabadi was first noticed when he beat Thailand’s Boonsak Ponsana at the latter’s home event exactly four Octobers ago. He had collapsed in the washroom from brain fever later, and his recovery and title-winning run later in China had been as much a silent relief as a brass band announcing its arrival.He has made a habit of beating the world’s top names in their backyard, and slowly breaking the hearts of home fans — he snapped shut twice Olympic champ and five-time world champion Lin Dan in China in 2014 and recently schooled the reigning world champ Viktor Axelsen in Denmark.The youngster seemed to remain aloof from fame though. He hadn’t warmed up to it even after claiming his second Super Series title. “I needed to win the last point of the 2015 India Open final in Delhi to really assure myself that I was winning,” he says. When he won the Denmark Open last week, he was self-conscious on his way to court, before shyly giving a high-five to the Donald Duck mascot.If he has been mobbed ever, he hasn’t quite noticed. “No, no, I don’t ever get mobbed,” he says, incredulous. “When people came up to me at a Hyderabad mall, I realised, ‘Oh, people really watch badminton!’”It could be that superstardom comes easily to Nehwal and Sindhu, both affable girls never short on confidence. But be it Kashyap or Sai Praneeth or Srikanth, the men tend to pull on goofball faces and boast an easy, matter-of-fact wit, wearing their celebrity more lightly when going about playing Indian sport’s biggest catch-up.Globally, though, “Ki-daam-bi” is a mini-phenomenon, acknowledged as one of the finest talents in men’s singles today. The knowledgeable badminton world of East Asia and West Europe reckons Srikanth is the young prince in waiting, jostling to take over from the legends of the game, Lin Dan and Chong Wei, who are fading out slowly but surely. Chen Long is the next in line but Kidambi converts neutrals to diehard fans faster than his smash-and-charge-the-net routine that is the talk of the town when he slays his rivals.There is the big smash for everyone to swoon over, the pouncing net taps for those who sit back for a second dekko and, finally, the deception at the net for the aficionados. Nehwal had the power and grit, Sindhu thrives on speed and endurance, but Srikanth came into badminton with sublime strokes — unconventional because some are borrowed from the doubles game, and unreadable for opponents. India has had winners in the last decade, but in Srikanth lies the promise of greatness, if he can rise to the big moments.For better or for worse, he goes about this challenge unrushed, reserving all the flurry and pace only for his formidable attacks. Watching a Srikanth match is savouring every rally and not quite knowing when his layered game, with its deft deceptions and shot selection, will turn the tables on his opponent. Not so much an outwitting of opponents as out-conjuring by a wizard. And because it’s so innate, Srikanth struggles at deconstructing it for muggles. “I’m not really thinking about winning, I only want to be consistent and play my best.”He values precision. “At that particular moment, if I can send the shuttle in a particular direction, I think I’ve played well that day,” he says. Consistency is a desired quality for a shuttler like him. “You don’t really get to smash always,” he wryly smiles as he mulls the transitions from defence to attack. “I put in a lot of effort into understanding my defensive training, because that is the only way I’d know when I can attack,” he says.On days when he is in ominous form, no opponent looks unbeatable. “For me, playing in the zone means when you feel really confident. .. You feel free on court, as if everything is working for you…I’m playing sharp and every shuttle gets into the court.”He talks about feeling free because he’s felt severely constricted at times, when badminton’s gotten overbearing. Brother Nandagopal talks of the Himalayan pressure that Srikanth brought upon himself soon after beating Lin Dan. “Social media had become big then, and he used to be very touchy about everything the press said,” he recalls. Around the badminton league in 2015, he had even snapped when quizzed by the media about his head-to-head with Chong Wei. “When he stopped over-thinking and realised he can control only his badminton and nothing else, he matured. If he wins, he starts preparing for the next tournament. If he loses, he gives credit to the opponent and moves on,” Nandagopal says.The two have shared a room for 16 years now. “I know he was upset after losing in the quarters of the Olympics (to Lin Dan). But he got over it and has won three titles this year. It took time, but he matured,” he says. The loss at Rio had been rough, his pain visceral, but he disappeared from view for a few days and returned wiser. “I’m not worried about losing, I don’t want to be super happy when I win either. I just don’t want to have any regrets after a match. I want to play every stroke that can get me a win,” Srikanth says, shrugging off his loss against Korean Son Wan Ho at the World Championships too.You’d think his fabulous run this season has him setting Tokyo 2020 in his sights. But he shuts off the topic. “First of all, it’s the Olympics, not easy. In a sport like badminton, I need to first qualify for Tokyo. Get rankings, play tournaments, and then everything will fall into place,” he says.Cocooned inside the world of training-tournaments-family-coach, Srikanth’s other interest is checking out the latest creation of Odisha’s sand artist Sudarshan Pattnaik. He grew up a fair bit on India’s quiet eastern coast, and he loved that his Maldives title came at a seafront. He reckons badminton is a bit like sand art — carving mounds of golden dust into something beautiful in that moment, and then letting the waves wash over it to build a new one the next day. Srikanth is building sand castles alright, but on terra firma. “I want to have that mark of being one of the best players in the world. To be known as someone who won every tournament. I want people to say here is someone who won everything and so many world championships,” he states his ultimate goal.What about material possessions? “I don’t shop too much — only when it’s necessary.” Or cars: “I drive, but I’m not obsessed with cars — you just need one car to reach wherever you need to go; not a fleet.” What about money? “I’ll wish I always have enough … but it’s not very important.” On being non-cricket’s Virat Kohli, because of his aggression and all that: “Hahahahahaha, I don’t know. I haven’t thought of that.”He is known to keep to himself at most times, and open up only in the company of friends or family. He watches tennis, digs Roger Federer, and started playing tennis with his brother, as an ode. Dhoni is his gold standard for consistency and temperament, and “getting the job done with minimal fuss.” His equanimity is right from the Dhoni manual of thinking.The closest he’s found magic in life is watching physio Challagunda fix his injuries. “You need to have complete belief in someone, and fully rely on them. He’s been watching over me from day one, he explains to me what my body has gone through.”He sports a variety of amulets, but reckons it’s best to prop up his game, and leave nothing to divinity. “I believe in God, but I’m not someone who’ll leave everything to God. 90 per cent is my hard work.”',real
'SEOUL: A North Korean soldier involved in an extremely rare and dramatic defection to the South was shot six times by North Korean border troops as he dashed over the border, military officials and doctors said on Tuesday. The US-led United Nations Command (UNC), which monitors the Panmunjom border truce village where the defection occurred Monday, said the soldier had driven close to the heavily-guarded, military demarcation line separating the two Koreas in a vehicle. \"He then exited the vehicle and continued fleeing south across the line as he was fired upon by other soldiers from North Korea,\" the UNC said in a statement. An official with the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said the North\'s border guards fired at least 40 rounds. A doctor treating the injured soldier -- who was helicoptered to a hospital for emergency surgery -- said he had been shot half-a-dozen times, including a serious stomach wound. \"He has at least six gunshot wounds on his body and the penetrating wound in the abdomen is the most serious\", the doctor, Lee Cook-Jong, told reporters. It is very rare for the North\'s troops to defect at the truce village, a major tourist attraction bisected by the demarcation line and the only part of the frontier where forces from the two sides come face-to-face. The fact that the defector drove to the border suggests he may not have been a member of the elite corps of North Korean troops posted to Panmunjom, who are carefully vetted and selected for their loyalty. No tourists were present at the time, because tours do not run on Mondays. According to the South Korean military there was no exchange of fire across the border, and the UNC statement stressed that no South Korean or US forces were harmed in the incident, which happened in broad daylight around 4:00pm. Unlike the rest of the frontier, Panmunjom is not fortified with minefields and barbed wire and the border is marked only by a low concrete divider. After racing across the border, the soldier took cover near a building on the South side. The Joint Chiefs of Staff official said he was found collapsed in a pile of fallen leaves and recovered by three South Korean soldiers crawling on their stomachs to his position. In 1984, a Soviet citizen sprinted across the border from North Korea to the South at Panmunjom in a defection bid, sparking a gunbattle that killed and wounded several soldiers on both sides. North Korean soldiers wielding axes hacked two US soldiers to death at Panmunjom in a 1976 brawl over an attempt to trim a tree there.

'SEOUL: When Kim Jong-un sat down in September to order the sixth and largest of North Korea\'s nuclear tests, Hwang Pyong-so sat by his side, his khaki military uniform conspicuous among the suits at the table, photos released by state media at the time showed. Now Hwang, once one of Kim\'s most-trusted advisers, is facing unspecified punishment on the orders of another man who also sat at that exclusive table in September, Choe Ryong-hae, South Korean intelligence officials believe. From left: Kim Jong-un, Kim Yong-nam, Hwang Pyong-so, Pak Pong-ju and Choe Ryong-hae. (Reuters photo) Information on North Korea is often difficult to obtain, and with few hard details and no official confirmation from Pyongyang, analysts said it was too soon to draw any firm conclusions from the unspecified punishments. But the moves, which appear to involve two of Kim\'s top four advisers, are being closely watched for indications of fractures within his secretive inner circle, and come as North Korea faces increasing international pressure over its nuclear weapons programme. Having his advisers compete with each other suits Kim just fine, said Christopher Green, an analyst with the Crisis Group. \"It is hardwired into autocracy to have underlings in competition,\" he said. Hwang, a shy, bespectacled general in his mid-60s, is a close confidante of Kim Jong-un and has had an unprecedented rise to the top rungs of North Korea\'s leadership in the space of a few years. File photo of Hwang Pyong-so (bottom left) while watching an air show by the Korean People\'s Air Force with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un on May 10, 2014. (Reuters photo) In 2014, he became one of the most powerful people outside the ruling Kim family when he was named chief of the General Political Bureau of the army, a powerful position that mobilises the military for the leader. His apparent punishment takes on additional meaning as it was orchestrated by Choe who has competed with Hwang in the past and stands to gain from any demotion, according to South Korea\'s spy agency. Tea with the enemy The two men were last seen in public together early last month as they watched a gymnastics gala, according to state media. Hwang has since faded from public view, whereas Choe was the ranking official who met with a senior envoy from China in Pyongyang last week. Kim has not shied away from removing or punishing even favoured leaders who could become powerful enough to threaten his grip on power, said Michael Madden, an expert on the North Korean leadership at 38 North, a project of the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced Studies in Washington. \"Vice Marshal Hwang Pyong-so could not have continued in the capacity that he was operating in, without it coming back to bite him,\" he said. Both Hwang and Choe came to South Korea during the Asian Games in 2014 - the highest such visit by North Korean officials to the rival South. Dressed in a drab, olive army uniform and his large officer\'s cap, Hwang, who had been promoted to the No. 2 spot behind Kim just one week earlier, had tea and lunch with Choe and South Korean officials and waved to crowds at the games\' closing ceremony. South Korea\'s Prime Minister Jung Hong-won (left), former South Korean minister for national defense Kim Kwan-jin (centre) and North Korea\'s Hwang Pyong So (right) at the closing ceremony of the 17th Asian Games at the Incheon Asiad Main Stadium, October 4, 2014. (Reuters photo) The trip had been announced just one day in advance and took many South Korean observers by surprise. Some suggested there may have been a power struggle between the two men, neither wanting to yield the high-profile visit to the other. Choe, who was subjected to political \"reeducation\" himself in the past, now appears to be gaining more influence since he was promoted in October to the party\'s powerful Central Military Commission, according to South Korean officials. The National Intelligence Service indicated Choe now heads the Organisation and Guidance Department (OGD), the secretive body which oversees appointments within North Korea\'s leadership. \'Clipping wings\' The punishment represents the first time Hwang has faced any major blow to his standing, said Lee Sang-keun, a North Korea leadership expert at Ewha Woman\'s University\'s Institute of Unification Studies. Hwang had a reputation of playing a respectful and careful role around the notoriously unpredictable Kim. Photos released by state media often showed him covering his mouth as he politely laughed with the supreme leader. The punishment may not reflect any specific mistakes on Hwang\'s part but could be part of a wider effort by Kim to ensure that the ruling party retains its control over the military, Lee said. The moves are part of a sweeping ideological scrutiny of the political unit of the military for the first time in 20 years, according to Kim Byung-kee, a lawmaker on South Korea\'s parliamentary intelligence committee. They could also be an effort to prevent a repeat of a major purge in 2013, 38 North\'s Madden said. Kim\'s uncle and second most powerful man in the secretive state, Jang Song Thaek, was executed during that purge after a special military tribunal found him guilty of treason. Preemptively putting Hwang in his place now meant Kim might prevent him from becoming so powerful he could only be dealt with in a similar way, Madden said. \"What (Kim\'s) doing can be described as clipping wings.\" Get latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.',real
'SEOUL: South Korean warships joined three US aircraft carriers Saturday in an unusually strong display of naval force aimed at North Korea, whose nuclear ambitions have been a focus of US President Donald Trump\'s ongoing tour of Asia. The four-day joint exercise in the western Pacific involves three flattops — USS Ronald Reagan, USS Nimitz and USS Theodore Roosevelt — and seven South Korean warships including three destroyers, Seoul\'s defence ministry said. It is the first such triple-carrier drill in the region for a decade. \"The exercise is aimed at enhancing deterrence against North Korea\'s nuclear and missile threats and showing off preparedness to fend off any provocative acts by the North,\" a ministry spokesman said. Nuclear-armed North Korea regularly denounces such military drills as rehearsals for invasion and sometimes conducts its own military manoeuvres or missile tests in response. The US warships will carry out air defence drills, sea surveillance, defensive air combat training and other training operations, the US Navy said. The exercises come on the heels of Trump\'s visits to Seoul and Beijing this week, which were dominated by the question of how to counter Pyongyang\'s nuclear weapons threat. In a speech to the South Korean parliament on Wednesday, Trump warned North Korea not to underestimate the United States, while offering leader Kim Jong-Un a better future if he gives up his nuclear ambitions.

'NEW DELHI: In the backdrop of India\'s interest in leasing out an airport in China-dominated Hambantota, Sri Lankan PM Ranil Wickremasinghe will be in New Delhi this week for talks with PM Narendra Modi. Wickremasinghe arrives on Tuesday and will speak at a key cyber security conference before meeting the Indian leadership. Sri Lanka has become an important partner for India both in the neighbourhood and in the Indian Ocean region. In addition, India is reportedly using Colombo\'s influence over Myanmar\'s Buddhist leadership to help defuse the Rohingya crisis. India has expressed interest in operating the Mattala international airport near the Hambantota port. China recently announced it would pay Sri Lanka $1.1 billion for Hambantota port\'s terminals, which may ease some of the debt Colombo has taken but will mean a virtually permanent Chinese ownership of their real estate. China\'s ambassador to Sri Lanka Yi Xianlang recently said that Chinese firms would invest $5 billion into the SEZ near the port. India wants to lease the Mattala airport for 40 years at something over $200 million - the trouble is, the airport is actually in the middle of nowhere, and is jokingly described as the world\'s \"emptiest\" airport. India wants to operate the airport for its own airlines, which have apparently reported an uptick in tourist travel to southern Sri Lanka. There is also some vague plan of using it as a training space or even as a freight hub. The leasing makes sense from a security/strategic point of view as it will give India eyes on Hambantota.

'LAS VEGAS -- A tourist is suing a Las Vegas Strip hotel, claiming a life-sized mannequin in his darkened room caused him to flee and suffer injuries.Kent Jacobs Boutwell, of Southern California, filed the lawsuit Monday against the Planet Hollywood casino-hotel in Clark County District Court, seeking at least $10,000 in damages.\"I\'ve got some experience handling hotel casino cases,\" said Boutwell\'s lawyer, Richard Johnson. \"This was certainly a new set of facts.\"Caesars Entertainment declined to comment on the lawsuit, citing pending litigation. On the use of mannequins in their nearly 2,500 hotel rooms, a spokeswoman said Planet Hollywood has traditionally been decorated with memorabilia, which is now being removed as part of a renovation that will wrap up this year.Boutwell said he was shocked and surprised by a human figure when he entered his darkened hotel room in the heart of the Strip in May 2015. As he tried to escape the room thinking that there was a person inside who was there to hurt him, he said he suffered serious injuries.It turned out that the human figure was a mannequin wearing a \"Miller Lite\" racing suit that was locked in a glass cabinet.The lawsuit claims he suffered undefined injuries to his body, limbs, organs, mind and nervous systems, resulting in conditions that may be permanent and disabling.The lawsuit claims a life-sized human figure in a darkened room is dangerous and hazardous and that Planet Hollywood should warn its customers about the mannequins.Boutwell said the incident has left him limited in what he can do for work and fun, including a loss of life enjoyment. He\'s seeking damages to cover his medical bills, attorney fees, pain and suffering and wages and earning potential.',real
'NEW DELHI: North Korea\'s \'Supreme Leader\' has kept the world on tenterhooks with a series of daring - and risky - nuclear tests, including one that killed 200 citizens this September. What Kim Jong-un is doing is foolhardy and being termed \'crazy\'. But India too had faced a global backlash when it conducted its nuclear test in 1998. Does the western world think it has the right to monopolise and control access to nuclear power and supplies? The current status of the nuclear balance suggests so. Which country has conducted highest number of nuclear tests? The west today is championing the banning of nuclear tests, but they have conducted the maximum number of nuclear tests. Have nuclear tests rapidly declined after the cold war? The highest number of nuclear tests were carried out between 1961 and 1970 -a period described by some experts as the height of the cold war as it was characterised by events like the Cuban missile crisis that brought US and USSR to the brink of a nuclear war. Since then there has been a steady decline and a drastic drop after the end of the cold war in the early 1990s. Who controls world nuclear fuel? Unlike other minerals, uranium, the main fuel of a nuclear reactor, is not freely traded. Any country wanting to make nuclear weapons or seeking to harness nuclear energy for peaceful purposes cannot buy it on the open market. The technology to build nuclear reactors is closely guarded by a voluntary association of 46 countries called the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), which follows guidelines for supplying uranium as well as the technology to make nuclear reactors. The policies of the group are determined by the industrialised countries and the developing world criticises it for not letting them access an energy source that can help fulfil their growing energy demand. Has any nuclear state given away its weapons? Yes, after signing the Budapest Memorandum (with US, UK and Russia) former Soviet states of Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan gave away their nuclear weapons to Russia. In return they were guaranteed perpetual sovereignty and territorial integrity. Russia, however, annexed the Ukrainian territory of Crimea in 2014 and it remains a matter of debate whether this might have happened had Ukraine retained these weapons. Who has how many nuclear weapons? Although North Korea is the only country that has conducted nuclear tests in this millennium, Russia and the US together have over 92\% of the world\'s total nuclear inventory. Because of the discriminatory nature of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), which is aimed at banning nuclear tests, India is among the major critiques of the pact which, it is argued, is a developed world tool for maintaining its nuclear monopoly. Incidentally, India hasn\'t signed either CTBT or the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).

'ATTLEBORO, Mass. -- - It took nearly 80 years, but a book borrowed during the Great Depression has been returned to a Massachusetts public library.The Attleboro Public Library posted on its Facebook page Thursday pictures of a copy of \"The Young Lady at Home,\" by T.S. Arthur. The book was returned this week. The due date stamped at the back of the book? Nov. 21, 1938.\"From 1938 we have no records of whose book it was, you know we were not searching this person out,\" librarian Amy Rhilinger told CBS Boston.The 19th century book \"seemed to be some type of guide for behavior,\" says Rhilinger.A library regular found the book in a basement in bad shape moldy and torn. Library staff members kept the book secure in an Attleboro archive but decided to get rid of it, fearing the mold could spread to other books.Library staff can\'t help but wonder who checked the book out in 1938. Back then, the world was on the brink of war and maybe the person who checked it out was a young Attleboro woman who wanted to ignore it all.\"Who was it? was somebody sick and there was a family emergency or did they say \'oh I thought my husband was going to return it, I thought Aunt Gertrude was going to return it,\'\" says Rhilinger.These days, the library charges ten cents a day for an overdue book. So, if the person who checked it out in 1938 came forward, they would owe almost $3,000.',real
'TERRE HAUTE, Ind. – A man tried running from a court hearing Monday after learning there was a warrant for his arrest, reports the CBS affiliate here, WTHI-TV.It began when Anthony Williams failed to appear on his originally scheduled court date Friday. That resulted in Judge Chris Wrede issuing a bench warrant for his arrest.When Williams showed up Monday morning, Wrede told a security officer to take him into custody on the warrant.That\'s when Williams ran.The officer -- and Judge Wrede -- ran after him.According to the officer and witnesses, Williams crashed into a locked door, breaking the glass.The officer said Williams opened the other door and stumbled his way past the metal detector at the entry.Williams made it through a first set of doors, but not a second.The officer used his Taser to end the chase.As the officer caught up with Williams, he said it looked like a scene from the Batman movies, because Judge Wrede was still in his black robe.Williams is due back in court on Thursday.',real
'A rarity is on the cards on the fourth day of the first Test between India and Sri Lanka. After a demolition show in Sri Lanka in the three Tests, India are going to concede first innings lead and the islanders would deserve every bit of it. The credit, largely, goes to Lahiru Thirimanne and Angelo Mathews who struck defiant fifties on the third day to put together 99 runs and take Sri Lanka towards a deficit of just 7 runs. At early stumps, due to fading light, Sri Lanka stood at 165/4 – without the duo – and still looking reasonably comfortable. Indian seamers, like their Sri Lankan counterparts, achieved plenty of lateral movement from the word go and are expected to get the same on Sunday.

'LUCKNOW: The UP Shia Central Waqf Board (UPShCWB), rejecting the claims of the UP Sunni Central Waqf Board (UPSCWB) to the Ram temple site in Ayodhya, on Monday unveiled a proposed solution for an out-of-court settlement of the Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri Masjid case: a Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya and a mosque in Lucknow. Shia board chairman Waseem Rizvi said they were in favour of a grand Ram temple at the disputed site, reiterating that the board was the rightful and only claimant to the land on which the demolished Babri mosque once existed. The Shia Board said the state government may in turn allot one acre of land for a mosque for Shia Muslims in Lucknow\'s Husainabad area, \"away from the religious territory of the Hindus\". An application seeking permission to file the said settlement proposal was submitted by the UPShCWB in the Supreme Court on Saturday. The move may revive the rift between the two communities which had led to innumerable sectarian clashes in the past. However, the Sunni leaders and clerics questioned the locus standi of Waseem Rizvi. \"The Allahabad high court in its judgment had allotted one-third of the land to the Sunni Waqf Bard. If anyone has any doubts over the Sunni Waqf Board\'s claim, then they should first challenge the high court order,\" said senior advocate Zafaryab Jilani, the convener of the All-India Babri Masjid Action Committee (AIBMAC) who has also represented the Sunni Waqf Board before the high court and the Supreme Court on the issue. He also claimed that the Shia community has not approved of the out-of-court settlement proposed by Rizvi. \"What Waseem Rizvi has suggested does not reflect the sentiments of the two communities per se as the top Shia clerics and the Shia Personal Law Board have already distanced themselves from it,\" said Sunni cleric Maulana Khalid Rasheed Farangi Mahali. He did not rule out the possibility of such moves leading to misunderstanding and eventually taking its toll on the harmony and cordial relations between Shias and Sunnis that had been restored after years of differences. \'2,000 lives already lost owing to the dispute\' At a press conference in Lucknow on Monday, UPShCWB chairman Waseem Rizvi said the board was of the view that the \"aastha (faith)\" of India\'s Hindus should take precedence over the \"ana (prestige)\" of the Muslim community, and that the proposal was in the national interest. He said 2,000 lives had already been lost owing to the dispute and a peaceful resolution, through talks, was essential for communal harmony. Rizvi was accompanied by Akhil Bhartiya Akhara Parishad chief Mahant Narendra Giri, who said anyone talking of peace was welcome to be a part of the talks, and added, \"History will not forgive those not agreeing to proposals such as the one put forth by the UPShCWB.\" Earlier, Rizvi claimed that the Sunni Central Waqf Board\'s 1944 notification, in which it claimed custody of the Babri Masjid, had been declared invalid by the Supreme Court in 1982. \"Since the Sunni Waqf Board\'s entire claim on the disputed structure is based on an invalid notification, the body cannot be considered a party to the dispute,\" Rizvi said. Quoting unspecified historians, he said Mir Baqi, a Shia commander in Mughal ruler Babar\'s army, had built the Babri Masjid, and his descendants had been \"mutawalli (custodians)\" of the mosque till 1945. Rizvi said the board would give up its claim to the disputed land, where the Babri Mosque anyway no longer exists, so that a grand Ram temple may be built at the site. Rizvi said the UPShCWB has written to the state government to allot 1 acre of \"nazul\" land in Husainabad, a high-density Shia area. He said the board would thereafter form a committee to ensure adherence to guidelines and provide funds for the construction of the mosque. \"The mosque shall be called Masjid-e-Aman (Mosque of Peace) and not named after any Mughal ruler, or even Mir Baqi,\" he said. The proposal document released by the UPShCWB on Monday contains pictures of Hindu religious leaders who it claims have endorsed it. These include, apart from mahant Narendra Giri, chief of Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas, mahant Nritya Gopaldas, VHP leader Rameshwar Das, Ayodhya Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas president Ram Vilas Vedanti, Hanumangarhi mahant Dharmdasji Maharaj, and others.

'HUNTINGDON, Pa. -- A Pennsylvania jury has awarded $870,000 to a man whose surgeon removed the wrong testicle.Steven Haines, 54, sued Dr. V. Spencer Long, whom Haines went to see in 2013 after suffering pain in his right testicle for 15 years. According to The Washington Post, an ultrasound revealed that the testicle had atrophied after damage from a previous injury, and surgical removal of the testicle was scheduled to help alleviate Hanes\'s pain.Long performed the operation, known as orchiectomy, at J.C. Blair Memorial Hospital in Huntingdon -- but removed Haines\' healthy left testicle instead of the damaged right one.A Huntingdon County jury on Wednesday found Long was \"recklessly indifferent\" and awarded Haines $620,000 for pain and suffering plus $250,000 in punitive damages. Long declined to comment after the verdict.Haines\' attorney, Braden Lepisto, told The Washington Post that to this day, \"it\'s still not totally clear\" how the mistake occurred.\"The doctor gave an explanation that really made no anatomical or medical sense,\" Lepisto told the newspaper. \"He claimed that he removed the testicle that was on the right side of the scrotum and the testicle had a spermatic cord that led to the left side of the body.\"Essentially, the doctor claimed that the testicles had switched sides at some point.\"The hospital told the Post that Long no longer works there.Though disturbing, such cases in which surgeons operate on the wrong body part are very rare. According to a 2006 analysis of nearly 3 million operations, the rate of wrong-site surgery was 1 in 112,994 cases.In 2014, one such case made headlines when a Texas man sued his doctors for mistakenly removing his healthy kidney instead of his cancerous one. A similar case happened in 2013 when doctors at a prominent hospital in New York City removed the wrong kidney from a man who been on dialysis because of two diseased kidneys.Haines\' lawyer says the man remains in pain, but has a \"debilitating fear\" of seeking further treatment for his problem. The attorney says Haines will need testosterone treatment for the rest of his life if he loses the remaining testicle.',real

'A day after US-based credit rating agency Moody’s Investors Services upgraded India’s sovereign rating to Baa2 — from Baa3 — with a stable outlook, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Saturday said the government should not be lured into a “false belief” that the economy is out of the woods.At a separate event, P Chidambaram, senior Congress leader and a former Finance minister under Singh, criticised the government’s acceptance of Moody’s ratings upgrade by pointing out that it had questioned the Moody’s methodology not long ago.On demonetisation, Chidambaram said, “I have reason to believe he (Prime Minister Narendra Modi) was not told that 86 per cent of currency was withdrawn. He was not told demonetisation must be followed by remonetisation, (and) in this case there wasn’t enough currency; (that) the RBI has not printed the replacement currency. The RBI board meeting was a farce. It was called on November 7 (2016). We don’t have a copy of the notice of the meeting…we asked for it. There was no background note. It was denied under RTI on grounds of national security. It lasted for all of half-an-hour.”Speaking with the media on the sidelines of a seminar on “Macroeconomic development in India; policy perspectives,’’ at St Teresa’s College in Ernakulam, former PM Singh said, “I am glad that Moody’s have done what they have done but we must not be, I think, lured into false belief that we are out of the woods,” Singh said. Pointing out that crude oil prices are now at $62-64 per barrel, up from about $40-45 a few months ago, the former PM said, “It (rising crude prices) can hurt balance of payment. It can also hurt the fiscal system.”On GST, Singh said, “GST is an idea which had the blessing of the Congress, but we would have implemented it after due care and adequate preparation.”Stating that there is “much to be desired” in both administration and implementation of GST, he said, “The fact that the (GST) Council has met so many times — they have now reduced (tax) rates of 211 items — showed that there was undue haste in implementation, and the bureaucracy had not done its homework. The net impact of hasty implementation of GST is that it led to the slowdown of our economic growth.”Speaking at the Tata Literature Live! The Mumbai Litfest 2017, Chidambaram said, “Just some months ago, (the) government had said the Moody’s methodology was all wrong.. A long letter was written by Shaktikanta Das (then economic affairs secretary), questioning Moody’s ratings methodology, saying… it’s all wonky.”',real
'The Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmulan Samiti (MANS) has filed complaints against a programme held at the PWD Ground in New Sangvi, between November 10 and 12. According to the MANS, speakers at the programme, ‘Deliverance Festival in Pune’, allegedly cheated people by “making unscientific and false claims about curing serious illnesses, such as heart diseases and cancer, by offering prayers”.A poster on the programme, among several put up across the city, purportedly stated ‘come and be delivered from sin, sickness, curses, and bindings of evil spirits’, and mentioned contact numbers of the ‘United Christian Fellowship, Pune’.On Friday, MANS officials held meetings with Pune Police Commissioner Rashmi Shukla and Deputy Commissioner of Police, Cyber Cell, Sudhir Hiremath. They demanded that an offence be registered in connection with this programme under sections of the Maharashtra Prevention and Eradication of Human Sacrifice and other Inhuman, Evil and Aghori Practices and Black Magic Act, 2013, and also under sections of the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954.The matter was brought to the notice of the MANS by Jaywant Jadhav, Anand Raichur and Rahul Bangonde, who claim to be members of pro-Hindutva groups. Nandini Jadhav, district president of MANS, said, “Jaywant Jadhav, a local resident, had filed a complaint with MANS about the programme on the PWD ground. We verified the facts and found that false claims, which spread superstition, were made by the speakers. So, we filed a complaint with the Sangvi police station on November 12. But no offence was lodged… so we filed complaints with the police commissioner and DCP, Cyber Cell… no action has been taken by the Sangvi police station… a proper inquiry should be conducted and an offence should be registered…”.“Videos of the programmes on PWD ground were posted on YouTube in three parts. We submitted all three YouTube links with our police complaint. But soon, the videos were removed from the site. This is suspicious. The Cyber Cell has assured to probe this matter,” said Jadhav.She added, “The MANS does not believe in any religious ideology. We received a complaint against an act of superstition, so we are working on it.” Jadhav, Raichur and Bangonde also accompanied the MANS activists at the Pune Police Commissionerate on Friday. “We approached the police and MANS for help in our individual capacity, and not as a part of any group…The programme was organised on the PWD Ground, which is the property of the state,” said Bangonde.',real

After November 30, 2019, the state will evaluate the computer typewriting courses started in these institutes and then decide on whether manual typewriting courses should continue,” the state government said in a circular.Maharashtra had over 3,500 typing and shorthand training institutes in which over 7 lakh students took the Government Certificate in Computer Typing Basic Course (GCC-TBC) every year. The test helped evaluate the students’ typing skills and the certification came in handy when people applied for government jobs.However, with typewriters becoming outmoded and almost redundant, the government was keen to shut down the course. “Typewriting machines are outdated, manufacturers have shut shop and there are no spare parts available in market. We need computer-trained individuals for government offices as wes adapt to e-governance,” said a GR released in October, 2013 by the department of school education and sports, which laid the grounds for the shutting of such schools.',real
'Just before a Capitol Hill meeting on Tuesday on tax reform aimed at helping families, attended by President Trump\'s daughter and top White House adviser Ivanka Trump, a hug between the eldest Trump daughter and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, left some on social media wondering if the brief encounter was more of a snub.The awkward embrace was captured by photographers, showing Trump appearing to be standing still, clutching her handbag, as Rubio went in for a warmer greeting.According to a statement released by Rubio\'s office, Trump joined Republican lawmakers to discuss tax reform focused on families, in particular, the child tax credit.While Rubio said he was \"glad to see strong support for pro-family policies,\" it was the hug left the greatest impression, sparking running commentary from the two involved.Rubio, seeming to poke fun at the various ongoing Congressional investigations, launched into his own Twitter sleuth mode, after he was informed of the perception of an \"alleged fail hug\" with Trump.\"We are also attempting to acquire multi-angle video which we believe will provide greater insight into this important matter,\" Rubio quipped.Rubio then tweeted out his own smoking gun, releasing two photos of the encounter, showing Trump placing a hand on Rubio\'s shoulder.\"Based on review of evidence and my own recollection, have concluded no hug was even attempted and press covfefe of alleged failed hug is false,\" the Republican senator reported, alluding to President Trump\'s famous Twitter gaffe that evolved into it\'s own debate over the meaning of \"covfefe.\"But Ivanka Trump tweeted her own version of events, saying \"anonymous sources say Marco Rubio planned the alleged failed hug. I have no comment (but I would have hugged him anyway!)\"Ivanka Trump later claimed Rubio\'s reporting was \"fake news\" and that he is an \"excellent hugger.\"Even her brother Donald Trump Jr. chimed in on \"hug gate,\" saying that \"there really needs to be more hugs in politics, even failed ones.\"The meeting on tax relief came after House Speaker Paul Ryan made a speech on overhauling the nation\'s tax code, which he vowed would be completed this year.Mr. Trump\'s daughter is expected to return to the Hill on Wednesday to meet with House Majority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-California, and other members to discuss paid leave and other issues affecting families.',real
'ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- In Alaska, it\'s not uncommon for wildlife like polar bears to wander onto an airport\'s runway, but a lounging seal is far more unusual.But that\'s what workers found at the airport in the nation\'s northernmost city on Monday. A seal estimated to weigh 450 pounds was removed from the runway at the airport at Utqiagvik by way of sled.A photo and video of the bearded seal lounging on the runway in the town formerly known as Barrow was shared by Scott Babcock on Facebook.The state Department of Transportation got in on the fun by warning pilots of \"low sealings\" at the airport.Meadow Bailey, the department\'s communications director, said Utqiagvik, an Arctic Ocean coastal community on Alaska\'s North Slope, experienced heavy storms Monday. Staff found the seal while clearing the runway.CBS News affiliate KTVA-TV reports airport staff commonly sees birds, caribou, polar bears and musk ox on the runway. But the seal sighting was a first.\"Wildlife strikes to aircraft pose a significant safety hazard and cost the aviation industry hundreds of millions of dollars each year,\" Bailey said. \"Birds make up over 90 percent of strikes in the US, while mammal strikes are rare. The safety of our aviation system and the traveling public is the primary goal during all wildlife control efforts.\"The department\'s staff members are not allowed to handle marine mammals, so the seal was removed by North Slope Animal Control.',real
' DU’s Dyal Singh (Morning) College wants to know from their students whether teachers are regular to class, have an interest in the subject, and are “open-minded”. These questions are part of a feedback form the college will provide to students — a move that has irked some teachers who call it “action against the academic community”. Only those students who have more than 70 per cent attendance will be asked to fill the feedback form. The first part of the form asks for details from students on the subjects they are studying, the marks they scored in the previous semester, and whether they intend to pursue a career in the same subject.The second part of the form asks students a series of questions, to be answered with a ‘yes’ or a ‘no’. The form is set to be passed in the governing body meeting soon.The questions are: Students have also been asked to write a line on what they “like best” about their teacher. Some teachers, however, criticised the system. Naveen Gaur, a teacher at the college, said, “It is obvious that teachers who are liberal and not very strict will get better feedback. This is going to affect the teaching-learning process. Other colleges might also be taking such feedback, but this is one of the worst kind of documents we have seen.” College principal I S Bakshi did not respond to queries on the issue.',real
'Last Updated Oct 11, 2017 12:10 AM EDTPresident Trump\'s attack on Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has Mensa saying \"it would be fun\" to have them take one of their IQ tests.Mensa\'s response comes on the heels of Mr. Trump saying in an interview published Tuesday that he\'s smarter than the top member of his Cabinet as he was reacting to a report that Tillerson previously called the commander in chief a \"moron.\"\"I think it\'s fake news, but if he did that, I guess we\'ll have to compare IQ tests. And I can tell you who is going to win,\" Mr. Trump told Forbes.On Tuesday, the high IQ society Mensa offered to administer the test. Charles Brown, the communications director for the group, joined CBSN\'s Elaine Quijano so she could try to answer the type of questions that would be asked.Brown and Quijano walked through one of the questions on CBSN\'s \"Red & Blue\" show, and CBS News has obtained two more questions:\"I\'m looking at the answer ... that\'s not what I came up with ...\" Quijano said about question one and added, \"See this is the difficulty of live television Charles ... it\'s forcing me to think in a way that is just completely foreign to me.\"Brown mentioned that some of the questions to be eligible for Mensa may seem fairly easy, but you may need to answer 80 questions in 30 minutes.Brown said that there are a number of well-known people part of Mensa including actors Nolan Gould and Geena Davis and lesser-known members \"from all walks of life.\" There are an estimated six million American\'s eligible for Mensa membership.Brown said neither the State Department nor the White House took up Mensa\'s offer directly.\"When we were asked earlier about President Trump\'s IQ and IQ testing ... we just thought it would be fun to invite the president and Secretary Tillerson to take our test -- not as a challenge or any kind of political commentary -- really it\'s just more about highlighting a special month for us,\" Brown said. \"October of 1946 was when our organization was founded and every October we take advantage of that to encourage admissions tests.\"Brown said there are more than 150 tests scheduled across the nation -- including some in the Washington, D.C. area. Mensa member IQs represent 2 percent of the population with about 134,000 members from 100 countries.\"Anyone who is interested in their IQ can schedule that,\" Brown told CBSN. He said to visit their website for more information.Earlier Tuesday, when asked about Tillerson\'s IQ at a State Department press briefing, spokeswoman Heather Nauert said simply, \"It\'s high.\"She described Tillerson as someone \"who can put things together\" due to his background as an engineer, and said he felt no need to justify how smart he is.\"The president is allowed to joke,\" Nauert said, and Tillerson is \"more than fine with that.\"',real

'Microsoft 365, which is a new solution from the software giant has been showcased for the Indian market. Microsoft 365 aims to combine Windows 10, Office 365 and Enterprise mobility as one complete package for enterprises, small and medium businesses (SMBs) in India. The idea with Microsoft 365 is to allow enterprises to have more control over their data, ensure seamless setting up for employees and streamline the IT management system as a whole.According to a Microsoft study called Workplace 2020, more and more employees are using their own devices and also checking personal emails on company-issued devices, which increases potential security risks. Additionally the study showed that many IT based device manufacturers (67 per cent) felt there was a need to reduce complexity of managing of IT security.The idea with Microsoft 365 is to provide all tools from the company under one package to an enterprise and SME. Microsoft 365 can allow for one solution to ensure setting up of company-issued devices with the right data policies, as well as deploy these policies to personal devices.“As the workplace is transforming—from changing employee expectations, to more diverse and globally distributed teams, we are seeing a new culture of work emerging. We are incredibly enthusiastic about Microsoft 365 and how it will help customers and partners drive growth and innovation to embrace this modern culture of work,” said Alok Lall, Partner Technology Lead, Microsoft India.Microsoft will offer this tool in three SKUs: Microsoft 365 Enterprise is geared for bigger companies, Microsoft 365 Business is meant for SMBs, while Microsoft 365 Firstline is meant for the firstline worker, those in customer service or those on the production line. The company plans to charge Rs 661 per user per month from companies that opt for the Microsoft 365 product.“Most enterprises or SMEs don’t have resources that are plenty. So then how can we help people achieve more, no matter what the device be it Android or iOS or whatever browser you are using. So we have something called ‘Always-on’ Security which goes beyond traditional security like say a firewall at work. We also offer simplification of business, where a company can set up/ onboard their employee in just 10 minutes,” explains Lall.The idea with ‘Always-on’ security is that with Microsoft 365 the IT admin can simply enable policies for even personal devices and protect important company data. So even if the device is lost or stolen, the company data will get wiped automatically, thus ensuring less data risk for companies. The policies can also allow for restrictions on copy-pasting of company data.Microsoft 365 can also be used to deploy Windows 10 via a new Windows Autopilot capability. This would allow the company’s policies, settings to be deployed on a new employee’s laptop and of this is done via the cloud server. “The advantage with this is that I can just ship the laptop to my remote worker in say Ghaziabad. He just logs in with this employee id and the settings are automatically applied. So the person does not even have to come to office to set up. Now any Windows 10 device can be ready with this feature,” explained Lall.',real

'NEW DELHI: In the backdrop of India\'s interest in leasing out an airport in China-dominated Hambantota, Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe will be in New Delhi this week for talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Wickremasinghe arrives here on Tuesday and will speak at a key cybersecurity conference before meeting the Indian leadership. Sri Lanka has become an important partner for India both in the neighbourhood and in the Indian Ocean region. In addition, India is reportedly using Colombo\'s influence over Myanmar\'s Buddhist leadership to help defuse the Rohingya crisis. India has expressed interest in operating the Mattala international airport near the Hambantota port terminal for which China recently announced it would pay Sri Lanka $1.1 billion for the Hambantota port\'s terminals, which may ease some of the debt Colombo has taken but will mean a virtually permanent Chinese ownership of their real estate. China\'s ambassador to Sri Lanka, Yi Xianlang, recently said that Chinese firms would invest $5 billion into SEZ near the port. India opted to lease the Mattala airport for 40 years at something over $200 million — the trouble is, the airport is actually in the middle of nowhere, and is jokingly described as the world\'s \"emptiest\" airport. India wants to operate the airport for its own airlines, which have apparently reported an uptick in tourist travels to southern Sri Lanka. Second, there is also some vague plan of using it as a training space or even as a freight hub. But it will give India eyes on Hambantota so, from a security/strategic point of view, the leasing makes sense. China is not pleased. Calling for cooperation between China and India in Sri Lanka, the official Global Times observed last week, \"The airport in Hambantota had reportedly lost about $113 million as of the end of 2016. It will not be easy for India to bring the airport to life and then use it to create jobs and generate tax revenues for the local economy. A quick deal to buy an existing airport, instead of focusing on greenfield manufacturing investment that can generate sustained income, is a shortcut to increasing New Delhi\'s presence in Sri Lanka to counter China\'s influence, but the local economy can hardly benefit from a deal like that.\" Wickremasinghe is himself in a spot of trouble, battling corruption charges in a \"banking scam\" and on Monday appeared before a presidential investigation commission investigating bonds issued by the central bank.

'MUMBAI : Reena Saini, a 26-year-old from Jaipur with good looks, acting talent and the experience of having performed with Delhi\'s National School of Drama, packed her bags for Mumbai last year, hoping to make a mark in a place where all the action is. Struggling to land a role, she met a casting director a few months later. \"He would often call me for auditions and I developed a working relation with him,\" said Saini. In September this year, she readily responded to one more of his casting calls. \"As I reached Oshiwara and called him, he suggested I meet him in his car instead. He was on the driver\'s seat and insisted I get into the seat next to him. His 6-year-old nephew was in the car too, yet he suddenly placed his hand on my thigh and felt me up. When I resisted, he changed the conversation,\" said Reena. \"He also suggested I stick the sunshield to the window, which I refused. On realizing the conversation was going nowhere I decided to leave. He stretched his hand out for a handshake and leaned forward for a hug. I complied but then he kissed my neck.\" When Reena confronted the casting agent over the phone later, she was warned of shame and stigma if she made the matter public. Bollywood rookies speaking out against the casting couch has always been rare, but Reena belongs to a recently changed scenario where more and more women are taking the legal course. She first took to Facebook to narrate her ordeal and when the casting agent reacted by shaming her in public, she approached the Cine & TV Artistes\' Association (CINTAA), the actors\' group. She filed an FIR on October 2, and the casting director has been absconding ever since. Between 2015 and 2017, nearly 50 such formal complaints of sexual harassment have been registered with CINTAA, and 47 of these cases have been addressed so far, Amit Behl, senior joint secretary of CINTAA told TOI. The group has directed victims to the police. Nine have filed FIRs, some cases were recorded as NCs (non-cognizable complaints) and in some others, the guilty have tendered a written apology, he said. \"Those 50-odd complaints comprise not more than 10\% of our members and a minuscule part of the actor population, but it\'s still an important development,\" said Suneel Sinha, member of CINTAA\'s executive and dispute committee. Between 2012 and 2015, only around 12 cases of sexual harassment were registered with CINTAA. This year will possibly be remembered as a watershed one of women talking about unwelcome sexual behaviour and taking action. be it the allegations against Hollywood movie moghul Harvey Weinstein or Indians adding to the worldwide outcry with the hashtag #metoo. Not to forget A-listers like Kangana Ranaut, Vidya Balan and Richa Chadda hitting prime-time TV to talk about sexual predators in Bollywood or TVF\'s Arunabh Kumar stepping down as CEO after being accused by multiple women of sexual misconduct. And with discussion on the subject reaching tipping point, the International Federation of Actors with 90 member countries and the Screen Actors Guild?American Federation of Television and Radio Artists have recently joined forces with CINTAA and the Producers Guild of India to combat the problem in India\'s entertainment industry. With around 5,000 actors in search of a foothold in cinema or TV at any given time in the city and scores waiting to abuse their vulnerability, another menace the industry has been struggling to weed out is fly-by-night \"co-ordinators\" or casting agents with pop-up offices in the Juhu-to-Mira Road stretch. \"Sometimes it\'s a 150 sq ft room with furniture, camera equipment and mock posters with recognizable names, and sometimes it\'s just a meeting at a coffee shop. The casting trap is laid via word of mouth, newspaper ads and now on social media. Most struggling actors are on multiple online groups and will respond to any opportunity. The keyword often used as a condition for a role is \'compromise\',\" said Behl. Given the lure of the screen- big or small- wannabe artistes often gamble all they have to realize their dream. \"But once the dirty job is done, these co-ordinators are gone without a trace.\" And it isn\'t always promise of work that leads to exploitation. \"It happens regularly on the sets with seasoned actresses too. Either being deliberately made to wait on the sets, unnecessary touching, the notorious body check or an explicit joke,\" said Payal Nair, member of CINTAA\'s executive committee. In May, Nikita Chaudhury (name changed), 27, after five years of working in the industry, filed an FIR with Oshiwara police against a producer, screenwriter and director after she discovered herself in porn films that she had been tricked into under the pretence of shooting for a comedy web series. \"I rushed to the police, who refused to file an FIR at first, so I had to settle for an NC. In fact, I booked a cab myself after a three-hour wait for the police to visit the producer\'s house. It was only after the intervention of two film associations that they filed an FIR and removed the links. By then the videos had already logged in over two lakh views.\" Frustrated with police inaction and apathy, Nikita said: \"It was important that these men were punished. Instead they\'re leading the same life and I fear for other unsuspecting girls.\" Despite attempts at bringing the casting couch culture to wider attention, for most actors, especially those from small towns or at the start of their careers, going public about such experiences without risking their career is difficult. \"Often they aren\'t financially strong or experienced to fight it out, so they withdraw cases,\" said Kashid Mehta, member of CINTAA\'s dispute committee. \"Our industry attracts a lot of people, and anyone with enough money can be a producer or financier. We have no method of filtering people, nor can we stop such harassment overnight, but we are ready to tackle it,\" said Behl, who chairs the dispute committee that has begun filming outreach videos warning actors of \"co-ordinators\" and urging women to stave off indecent proposals and speak up.

'HARARE: Zimbabwe\'s ruling party fired Robert Mugabe as its leader on Sunday and gave the 93-year-old less than 24 hours to quit as head of state or face impeachment, an attempt to force a peaceful end to his 37 years in power after a de facto coup. Mugabe, the only leader the southern African nation has known since independence from Britain in 1980, was replaced by Emmerson Mnangagwa, the deputy he sacked this month in a move that triggered Tuesday\'s intervention by the army. In scenes unthinkable just a week ago, the announcement was met by cheers from the 200 delegates packed into ZANU-PF\'s Harare headquarters to seal the fate of Mugabe, whose support has crumbled in the four days since the army seized power. Mugabe was given until noon (1000 GMT) on Monday to resign or face impeachment, an ignominious end to the career of the \"Grand Old Man\" of African politics who was once feted across the continent as an anti-colonial liberation hero. Even in the West, he was renowned in his early years as the \"Thinking Man\'s Guerrilla\", an ironic nickname for a man who would later proudly declare he held a \"degree in violence\". As the economy crumbled and political opposition to his rule grew in the late 1990s, Mugabe showed his true colours, seizing thousands of white-owned farms, detaining opponents and unleashing security forces to crush dissent. As the vote was announced, war veterans leader Chris Mutsvangwa, who has spearheaded an 18-month campaign to remove a man he openly described as a \"dictator\", embraced colleagues and shouted: \"The President is gone. Long live the new President.\" Mugabe\'s 52-year-old wife Grace, who had harboured ambitions of succeeding her husband, was also expelled from the party, along with at least three cabinet ministers who had formed the backbone of her \'G40\' political faction. Speaking before the meeting, Mutsvangwa said Mugabe, who has so far resisted calls to quit, was running out of time to negotiate his departure and should leave the country while he could. \"He\'s trying to bargain for a dignified exit,\" he said. If Mugabe refused to go, \"We will bring back the crowds and they will do their business,\" Mutsvangwa told reporters. Mnangagwa, a former state security chief known as \"The Crocodile,\" is expected to head an interim post-Mugabe unity government that will focus on rebuilding ties with the outside world and stabilising an economy in freefall. On Saturday, hundreds of thousands of people flooded the streets of Harare, singing, dancing and hugging soldiers in an outpouring of elation at Mugabe\'s expected overthrow. His stunning downfall is likely to send shockwaves across Africa, where a number of entrenched strongmen, from Uganda\'s Yoweri Museveni to Democratic Republic of Congo\'s Joseph Kabila, are facing mounting pressure to quit. Support evaporating On Saturday, men, women and children ran alongside the armoured cars and troops who stepped in to target what the army called \"criminals\" in Mugabe\'s inner circle. Meanwhile, the man himself remained under house arrest in his lavish \'Blue Roof\' compound, watching the support from his party, security services and people evaporate. Speaking from a secret location in South Africa, his nephew, Patrick Zhuwao, told Reuters Mugabe and his wife were \"ready to die for what is correct\" rather than step down in order to legitimise what he described as a coup. Zhuwao, who was also sanctioned by ZANU-PF, did not answer his phone on Sunday. On Harare\'s streets, few seemed to care about the legal niceties as they heralded a \"second liberation\" and spoke of their dreams for political and economic change after two decades of deepening repression and hardship. More than 3 million Zimbabweans - around 20 percent of the population - have emigrated to neighbouring South Africa in search of a better life. The huge crowds in Harare have given a quasi-democratic veneer to the army\'s intervention, backing its assertion that it is merely effecting a constitutional transfer of power, rather than a plain coup, which would entail a diplomatic backlash. Despite the euphoria, some Mugabe opponents are uneasy about the prominent role played by the military, and fear Zimbabwe might be swapping one army-backed autocrat for another, rather than allowing the people to choose their next leader. \"The real danger of the current situation is that having got their new preferred candidate into State House, the military will want to keep him or her there, no matter what the electorate wills,\" former education minister David Coltart said. The United States, a longtime Mugabe critic, said it was looking forward to a new era in Zimbabwe, while President Ian Khama of neighbouring Botswana said Mugabe had no diplomatic support in the region and should resign at once. Besides changing its leadership, ZANU-PF said it wanted to change the constitution to reduce the power of the president, a possible sign of its desire to move towards a more pluralistic and inclusive political system.

'HARARE, Zimbabwe: Clinging to his now virtually powerless post, longtime Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe on Sunday was set to discuss his expected exit with the army commander who put him under house arrest, while the ruling party prepared to recall the world\'s oldest head of state as its leader. A day after huge crowds rallied peacefully in the capital, Harare, for the 93-year-old Mugabe to go, the ruling party\'s Central Committee was meeting on demands by provincial branches to recall him. It also was expected to reinstate the vice president whose firing nearly two weeks ago led the military to step in, and recall the unpopular first lady as head of the women\'s league. That former vice president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, is expected to lead a new government. Without the military\'s intervention, first lady Grace Mugabe likely would have replaced him as vice president and been in a position to succeed her husband. Impeaching the president is another step when Parliament resumes Tuesday, and lawmakers will ``definitely\'\' put the process in motion, the main opposition\'s parliamentary chief whip told The Associated Press. Innocent Gonese with the MDC-T party said they had been in discussions with the ruling ZANU-PF party to act jointly. ``If Mugabe is not gone by Tuesday, then as sure as the sun rises from the east, impeachment process will kick in,\'\' Gonese said. Mugabe\'s talks with army commander Constantino Chiwenga are the second round of negotiations on an exit as the military tries to avoid accusations of a coup. Zimbabwean officials have not revealed details of the talks, but the military appears to favor a voluntary resignation by Mugabe to maintain a veneer of legality in the political transition. Mugabe, in turn, could be using whatever leverage he has left to try to preserve his legacy as one of Africa\'s liberation leaders or even protect himself and his family from possible prosecution. The discussions come ahead of a key ruling party congress next month, as well as scheduled elections next year. Sunday\'s negotiations do not appear to include the South African government delegation that took part in the first round. South Africa\'s president on Saturday said talks are in ``early days.\'\' The southern African regional bloc will hold a four-country summit in Angola on Tuesday to discuss the Zimbabwe situation. Mugabe finds himself increasingly isolated under house arrest in his lavish Blue Roof mansion, deserted by most of his allies, with others arrested. On Saturday, most of Harare\'s population of 1.6 million poured into the streets in an anti-Mugabe demonstration that just days ago would have brought a police crackdown. They clambered onto tanks moving slowly through the crowds, took selfies with soldiers and surged in the thousands toward the State House building where Mugabe held official functions, a symbol of the rule of the man who took power after independence from white minority rule in 1980. The euphoria came after years of watching the once-prosperous African nation fall into decay, with a collapsing economy, repression of free speech, disputed elections and international sanctions. Even as concerns remained about who next would be in charge and what freedoms might be available if the military lingers in power _ or if Mnangagwa succeeds his longtime ally Mugabe as leader _ people reveled in the rare chance to express themselves freely. Let us have this moment, Zimbabweans said. If the next leader becomes trouble, they vowed to return to the streets again.

'HARARE: Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe clung to the vestiges of office today, using a TV address to maintain he was still in power despite a military takeover and a mounting clamour for his autocratic 37-year rule to end. \"The (ruling ZANU-PF) party congress is due in a few weeks and I will preside over its processes,\" Mugabe said, pitching the country into deep uncertainty. Many Zimbabweans had expected Mugabe, 93, to announce his resignation after the army seized power, opened the floodgates of citizen protest and his once-loyal party told him to quit. But Mugabe, sitting alongside the uniformed generals who were behind the military intervention, delivered a speech that conveyed he was unruffled by the turmoil. Speaking slowly and occasionally stumbling as he read from the pages, Mugabe talked of the need for solidarity to resolve national problems- business-as-usual rhetoric that he has deployed over decades. He made no reference to the chorus for him to resign and shrugged off last week\'s dramatic military intervention. \"The operation I have alluded to did not amount to a threat to our well-cherished constitutional order nor did it challenge my authority as head of state, not even as commander in chief,\" he said. Instead he urged harmony and comradeship. \"Whatever the pros and cons of how they (the army) went about their operation, I... do acknowledge their concerns,\" said Mugabe. \"We must learn to forgive and resolve contradictions, real or perceived, in a comradely Zimbabwean spirit.\" His address provoked immediate anger, and raised concerns that Zimbabwe could be at risk of a violent reaction to the political turmoil. \"That speech has nothing to do with realities. We will go for impeachment and we are calling people back to the streets,\" Chris Mutsvangwa, head of the influential war veterans\' association, told AFP. It was not immediately clear from his remarks when and where the protests would take place. On Saturday, in scenes of public elation not seen since Zimbabwe\'s independence in 1980, huge crowds had marched and sang their way through Harare, believing Mugabe was about to step down. Highlighting the contradictions in Zimbabwean politics, the ruling ZANU-PF party sacked Mugabe as its leader earlier yesterday and told him to resign as head of state, naming ousted vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa as the new party chief. Analysts say the military stepped in last week after Mugabe\'s wife Grace, 52, secured prime position to succeed him as president following a bitter power struggle with Mnangagwa, who has close ties to the army. The majority of Zimbabweans have only known life under Mugabe- the world\'s oldest head of state- during a reign defined by violent suppression, economic collapse and international isolation. Sources suggest Mugabe has been battling to delay his exit and to secure a deal guaranteeing future protection for him and his family. \"What you saw yesterday, it shows that the people have spoken,\" Mordecai Makore, 71, a retired teacher told AFP about Saturday\'s marches. \"All we want is peace, a good life with a working economy that creates jobs for our people. We will continue praying for that. I want my children and grandchildren to live a normal good life.\" The factional succession race that triggered Zimbabwe\'s sudden crisis was between party hardliner Mnangagwa- known as the Crocodile- and a group called \"Generation 40\", or \"G40\", because its members are generally younger, which campaigned for Grace\'s cause. The president, who is feted in parts of Africa as the continent\'s last surviving independence leader, is in fragile health. But he previously said he would stand in elections next year that would see him remain in power until he was nearly 100 years old. He became prime minister on Zimbabwe\'s independence from Britain in 1980 and then president in 1987.

'HARARE: Embattled Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe will meet on Sunday with the army chiefs who took over Zimbabwe in a bid to end the crisis that has gripped the nation, state TV said. \"President Robert Mugabe will meet the commander-elect of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces (on Sunday),\" said the ZBC broadcaster, citing father Fidelis Mukonori, the catholic priest who is chairing the talks between Mugabe and the military. The announcement of the crunch talks comes after tens of thousands of overjoyed protesters flooded Zimbabwe\'s streets on Saturday, celebrating the crumbling of Mugabe\'s ruthless regime which had controlled the country for nearly 40 years. The mass turnout came after an unprecedented week in which the military seized power and put Mugabe under house arrest in response to his sacking of vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa.

'NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court today directed the Centre and the West Bengal government to file in a sealed cover their responses on a plea by BJP leader Mukul Roy alleging that his phones were being tapped by the state police. Justice Vibhu Bakhru asked the Centre, state government and Roy\'s telecom service providers -- MTNL and Vodafone to file their affidavits stating whether Roy is being monitored or his calls are intercepted by any of the agencies. The court said if this is being done, then also file the reason in sealed cover. The court asked them to file their affidavit in two weeks and listed the matter for December 7. During the hearing, counsel for the Centre and the West Bengal government opposed the petition saying if at all any cause of action arises, it should be at the court in West Bengal. The former Trinamool Congress MP had alleged that while he was in West Bengal, he had always found that the local police were monitoring his movements. Roy, who left his old party to join the BJP earlier this month, had sought direction to his telecom service providers to produce before the court orders, if any, issued by the Centre or the state government to intercept telegraphic messages originating from or received by the leader or any of his relatives.

'NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Monday asked the Centre and the West Bengal government to \"unambiguously\" inform whether politician Mukul Roy, who recently joined the BJP, was being monitored or his calls being intercepted allegedly by the state police. The court\'s direction came when it was hearing the former Trinamool Congress MP\'s plea seeking a CBI probe into the alleged surveillance and tapping of his phone by the West Bengal police. Justice Vibhu Bakhru issued notices and asked the ministries of home affairs and information and broadcasting, West Bengal government and police, CBI, MTNL and Vodafone to file their responses in a sealed cover in two weeks. \"Notice issued. Respondents to file counter affidavits unambiguously stating whether the petitioner (Roy) is being monitored or his calls are intercepted by any of the agencies. If so, they should also file the affidavits with reasons in sealed cover,\" the court said and listed the matter for hearing on December 7. It also said that it was open for the authorities to take all legal grounds in the affidavit, including the issue of jurisdiction. During the hearing, senior advocate Arvind Nigam, appearing for Roy, said they have made a representation before the Centre and added \"let them (Union and the state) say on an affidavit that they are not tapping my calls.\" Central government standing counsel Amit Mahajan opposed the petition and questioned the jurisdiction, saying if at all any cause of action arises, it should be at a court in West Bengal. The lawyer said no monitoring was done without following due process and the politician\'s claim was only that he apprehended that he was under surveillance. \"Today it is one petition that the petitioner apprehends surveillance and if it is entertained, tomorrow 20,000 such pleas will come. Where is the cause for apprehension,\" he argued. Senior advocate Dinesh Mathur, appearing for the West Bengal government and police, questioned Roy\'s move of filing the petition in Delhi and not in Kolkata and claimed it was a fishing and roving enquiry. To this, the court asked the Centre and state government to make a statement on record that Roy\'s claim was incorrect and it will close the matter. \"Everything has checks and balances. Those checks and balances are subject to judicial review. They are public figures and not criminals,\" it said. The plea has also sought directions to Roy\'s telecom service providers MTNL and Vodafone to produce the orders, if any, issued by the Centre or the state government to intercept telegraphic messages originating from or received by the leader or any of his relatives. Advocate Kumar Dushyant Singh, who filed the petition on behalf of Roy, has said the CBI should be asked to investigate the \"interception of telegraphic messages originating from or received by the petitioner or any of his relatives\". He said that in case any such order was issued, the court should direct the Department of Telecommunications, Ministry of Communications and Telecom Regulatory Authority of India to investigate any violation of the \'License Agreement for Unified License\' by Roy\'s mobile service providers. Roy has alleged that while he was in West Bengal, he always found that the local police were monitoring his movements. The plea has claimed that similar apprehensions were put on record by several other persons including Union minister Babul Supriyo, who does not belong to the ruling party in West Bengal.

'BANGKOK: Myanmar has subjected Rohingya Muslims to long-term discrimination and persecution that amounts to ``dehumanizing apartheid,\'\' Amnesty International said Tuesday in a report that raises questions about what those who have fled a violent military crackdown would face if they returned home. Since late August, more than 620,000 Rohingya have fled Myanmar\'s Rakhine state into neighboring Bangladesh, seeking safety from what the military described as ``clearance operations.\'\' The United Nations and others have said the military\'s actions appeared to be a campaign of ``ethnic cleansing,\'\' using acts of violence and intimidation and burning down homes to force the Rohingya to leave their communities. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said earlier this month that the world body considered it ``an absolutely essential priority\'\' to stop all violence against the Rohingya and allow them to return to their homes. They are now living in teeming refugee camps in a Bangladesh border district, and officials in Dhaka have also urged that Myanmar allow them to return with their safety assured. Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi said Tuesday the government would follow a formula set in a 1992-93 repatriation agreement between Bangladesh and Myanmar, which are holding bilateral negotiations on the new refugee crisis. Amnesty International compiled two years\' worth of interviews and evidence in its report, detailing how Rohingya lived within Myanmar, where they were subjected to a ``vicious system of state-sponsored, institutionalized discrimination that amounts to apartheid,\'\' meeting the international legal definition of a crime against humanity. Rohingya Muslims have faced state-supported discrimination in the predominantly Buddhist country for decades. Though members of the ethnic minority first arrived generations ago, Rohingya were stripped of their citizenship in 1982, denying them almost all rights and rendering them stateless. They cannot travel freely, practice their religion, or work as teachers or doctors, and they have little access to medical care, food or education. Amnesty\'s report said the discrimination had worsened considerably in the last five years. ``I wanted to go to Sittwe hospital for medical treatment, but it\'s forbidden,\'\' Abul Kadir, 36, was quoted as telling the human rights group. ``The hospital staff told me I couldn\'t go there for my own safety and said I needed to go to Bangladesh for treatment. It cost a lot of money.\'\' Rohingya have fled en masse to escape persecution before. Hundreds of thousands left in 1978 and again in the early 1990s, though policies subsequently allowed many to return. Communal violence in 2012, as the country was transitioning from a half-century of dictatorship to democracy, sent another 100,000 fleeing by boat. Some 120,000 remain trapped in camps outside Rakhine\'s capital, Sittwe. Rohingya were thought to number around 1 million people in Myanmar until late last year. That October, a Rohingya militant group killed several officers in attacks on police posts, and the military retaliation sent 87,000 Rohingya fleeing. A larger militant attack on Aug. 25 killed dozens of security forces, and the military response was swift and comprehensive. By the tens of thousands, Rohingya began fleeing, their villages set aflame, some of the survivors bearing wounds from gunshots and land mines. Though the waves of refugees are now thinner, people are still crossing the Myanmar border nearly three month later. Suu Kyi in her remarks Tuesday was hopeful a memorandum of understanding could be agreed upon soon to allow for the safe, voluntary return of people who fled to Bangladesh. She did not call them Rohingya, a name shunned by many in Myanmar who believe they are illegal immigrants. Amnesty International\'s report cautioned that economic development of Rakhine should not be a tool of further discrimination. Myanmar has supported an international expert panel\'s recommendations on developing the impoverished state, but the same report urged Myanmar to grant citizenship and ensure that other rights of Rohingya were protected. Foreign ministers and representatives of 51 countries began a meeting in Naypyitaw, Myanmar\'s capital, on Monday in a forum that aims to further political and economic cooperation but takes place against the backdrop of the refugee crisis. ``The international community must wake up to this daily nightmare and face the reality of what has been happening in Rakhine State for years,\'\' said Anna Neistat, Amnesty International\'s Senior Director for Research. ``While development is an important part of the solution, it cannot be done in a way which further entrenches discrimination. The international community, and in particular donors, must ensure that their engagement does not make them complicit in these violations.\'\' Get latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.',real

'SEOUL, South Korea: It\'s obvious to anyone who looks at a map but also, this week, especially noteworthy: The leaders of two nations that have squared off with harsh words and the threat of nuclear war are now closer to each other than New York City\'s Trump Tower is to the White House. That\'s presuming North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is in fact in Pyongyang, which is likely, though not as definite as US President Donald Trump\'s presence in Seoul, the South Korean capital. The American leader was there on Tuesday, meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and urging Kim to \"come to the table\" and \"make a deal.\" The proximity of Trump and Kim this week is an interesting blip and, probably, little more. But it underscores a daily fact of life for the residents of the two Koreas\' capitals: Their seats of government, mortal enemies linked by a common heritage, spend every day virtually breathing down each other\'s geographic necks. Seoul, home to the Blue House where South Korea\'s president works, is just 125 miles (200 kilometers) from Pyongyang\'s Kim Il Sung Square and the heart of the North Korean regime. New York City, by comparison, is 205 miles (330 kilometers) from Washington, DC. Trump will not get as near as he might to Pyongyang, however. On this trip, at least, he is not visiting the Demilitarized Zone that marks the border between North Korea and South Korea.

'WELLINGTON: New Zealand\'s new government is moving quickly to fulfill a campaign promise by banning foreign investors from buying homes. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced on Tuesday that she expects to introduce new laws within weeks that would take effect early next year. She said the government is determined to make it easier for New Zealanders to buy homes and to stop foreigners from driving up prices. She said the ban would not affect most existing free- trade agreements and would be enacted before the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free-trade deal that 11 nations, including Japan and Australia, are considering signing. Under the proposed legislation, Australians and foreigners who are New Zealand citizens or residents would be exempt. Foreigners could also continue to buy residential land to build new homes.

'NEW DELHI: The road transport ministry and Niti Aayog are not on the same page on the proposed electric mobility (e-vehicle) policy. The ministry has suggested to Niti Aayog to redraft the policy, saying the government\'s think tank should not get into the implementation of the mission as mentioned in the present draft. The ministry has also suggested that the policy should be framed after a meeting preferably chaired by the principal secretary to the Prime Minister. It has also objected to the proposal of keeping the ministry out in the apex panel proposed by the Niti Aayog to take decisions on the rollout of electric mobility mission. Interestingly, ministries of urban and rural development are part of the panel beside the Niti Aayog. Addressing a conference on smart mobility organised by industry body FICCI, Gadkari on Monday said battery swapping policy proposed for the successful rollout of electric vehicles is unviable. Battery swapping means generic batteries which can be used by any electric vehicle and are available at petrol pumps or other charging stations on rent. \"The swapping (battery) policy, I feel is not appropriate for the country because it is a very difficult thing that is not going to be possible in the country,\" Gadkari said. He added Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant had discussions with him on the issue and he had suggested scrapping of the idea. Niti Aayog, in a suggestion paper, had said that accelerated adoption of electric and shared vehicles could save $60 billion in diesel and petrol cost and cut down as much as one gigatonne of carbon emissions for India by 2030 while advocating standardised, smart and swappable batteries with lease and/or pay-per-use business models.

'Book: Bombay Fever\r\nAuthor: Sidin Vadukut\r\nPublication: Simon & Schuster\r\nPages: 371 pages\r\nPrice:  350The notion of a deadly plague sweeping through the land has long provided fodder for creativity. In Bombay Fever, Sidin Vadukut takes this all-too-believable genre and adapts it smartly to an Indian context, despite some shortcomings in terms of plausibility and style.A chance encounter in a foreign land leads to the birth of a contagion that soon grows to terrorise India. Struggling in the midst of a rapidly deteriorating society, a diverse group of people ranging from medical workers to doctors without licenses must attempt to make sense of a disease that proves to be as baffling as it is dangerous. Backed by the premise of drug-resistant diseases — a growing fear in modern society — the book attempts a broad depiction of the growth and spread of a contagion, and the ensuing reactions.The strength of Bombay Fever is the lack of a central protagonist, with a sufficiently broad narrative vantage point. It hops from character to character with commendable fluidity, fleshing out its world with each new perspective. There are, of course, a handful of characters whose points of view are visited more often, but progress often comes from minor and seemingly unexpected corners, including, at one point, mass-forwarded messages on social media. This makes the unspooling of the plot much more organic, though certain incidents teeter between believable and convenient. The sheer scope of the story necessitates putting an abrupt end to certain characters or plot threads, but such conclusions do not come across as gratuitous.',real

'YOKOTA AIR BASE: President Donald Trump warned on Sunday that \"no dictator, no regime\" should underestimate the US, as he kicked off an Asian tour likely to be dominated by the threat posed by North Korea. \"No one, no dictator, no regime... should underestimate American resolve,\" Trump told cheering servicemen at the Yokota Air Base on his arrival in Japan. Trump had earlier described Japan as a \"treasured partner and crucial ally of the US\", as Asian partners look for reassurance that Washington will back them if conflict with North Korea were to break out. The president was speaking at the start of a marathon Asian tour that will take in five countries, starting with a trip to Japan to visit his \"friend\" Shinzo Abe. Before touching down, Trump had announced to reporters on Air Force One that he was expecting to meet his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin during the trip, as the international community strives for a solution to the North Korea crisis. \"I think it\'s expected we\'ll meet with Putin, yeah.

'The lack of transparency surrounding a conference of the World Health Organisation (WHO) on access to medical products being organised in Delhi has raised eyebrows. The list of participants, speakers and delegates is not on the conference website and most Indian activists and lawyers who have worked on access to medicine have not been invited. The three-day conference titled \"Ist World Conference on Access to Medical Products and International Laws for Trade and Health, in the context of 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\" starting on Tuesday is being organised by the WHO, health ministry and Indian Society of International Law. The website lists the sessions for each day but gives no details of the speakers. Those who want to register are told they will get an email confirming their registration if they are eligible to attend. However, WHO and the ministry are tightlipped about what the eligibility criteria are. Both claimed the other did the vetting. Asked why Indian civil society groups working on access to medicines have not been invited, Dr Madhur Gupta of WHO told TOI: \"We have civil society groups from all over the world and the hall can accommodate only 150 people. We have sent invitations to some Indian civil society groups also.\" However, she was not willing to reveal who had been invited from India other than ministry officials and representatives of international organisations. RG Singh, under secretary in the health ministry, said on Friday (November 17) that the participants\' list was being finalised by the WHO and would be on the website soon. He claimed not to have further details. Anand Grover of Lawyers Collective told TOI that he had received an invitation a few months back after which he had heard nothing from the organisers. \"The conference is day after and I have no clue what I am speaking on and at what time. Indian activists have done all the work on access to medicine but have to play second fiddle to those from the US and abroad. This is ridiculous. Why invite and then behave in this manner?\" asked Grover. \"It\'s a typical colonial mindset which acknowledges only civil society groups working in the global North and connected to activism in Geneva. Though India is organizing it, there seems to be scant respect for Indian civil society and the work it has done to ensure access to medicines in India, the pharmacy of the developing world,\" said a senior civil society activist. K Gopakumar of Third World Network, an international NGO, has been invited but said that the conference seemed to go against the WHO\'s spirit of inclusive participation. \"The registration process ought to be more transparent with publicly available eligibility criteria,\" he said. Till Sunday evening, the website had no details and access to even background papers was only with a login password given to invited speakers or registered participants.

'YV Reddy, former governor of the Reserve Bank of India and chairman of the Fourteenth Finance Commission, who was one of the panelist at an event here discussing the state of Indian economy said that while India “may not be the most attractive destination for investors, nobody can afford to ignore her anymore”.Reddy however, cautioned that the booming bond market in the country may not be a good sign and that policy makers should watch out for the risks it poses. “If the economy is growing at six or seven percent and if banks are not lending not because they don’t have money but they are not sure how the business is running. So my problem is whether the risk of the borrowers balance sheet has shifted from the banks now incrementally to the bond market,” said Reddy.Reddy also said, demonetisation of high value currency notes “can’t be justified” on economic grounds. Reddy, who headed the RBI from 2003 to 2008, said, “it is inconceivable that the Prime Minister did not know the impact… now the interesting part of it is a high risk was taken how much… it’s going to inconvenience people. So obviously it was a decision taken to demonstrate to the people that ‘I’m determined’ to fight corruption.”',real
'TOKYO: President Donald Trump on Monday refused to rule out eventual military action against North Korea and declared that the United States \"will not stand\" for Pyongyang menacing America or its allies. In his first stop of an extended trip in Asia, Trump stood with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at a news conference and suggested the United States will arm Japan, much as the United States has done with allies in the Middle East like Saudi Arabia. He did not deny reports that he has expressed frustration that Japan did not shoot down a ballistic missile North Korea recently fired over its territory. \"He will shoot \'em out of the sky when he completes the purchase of lots of additional military equipment from the United States,\" Trump said of Abe. \"He will easily shoot them out of the sky.\" Japan, under its war-renouncing Constitution, can shoot down a missile only when it is aimed at the country or in case debris are falling on to its territory. Some hawkish members of Abe\'s Liberal Democratic Party say that it may be possible to shoot down a missile headed toward Guam in case it causes existential threat to the US as Japan\'s ally, but experts say that is questionable. Trump\'s trip abroad comes amid dismal ratings among voters for the first-time president and questions about whether he can handle the nuclear standoff with North Korea. Standing in an Asia capital in range of North Korea\'s missiles, Trump defended his fiery language, declaring Pyongyang \"a threat to the civilized world.\'\' \"Some people say my rhetoric is very strong but look what has happened with very weak rhetoric in the last 25 years,\'\' said Trump with Abe at the news conference. Abe, who has taken a more hawkish view on North Korea than some of his predecessors, agreed with Trump\'s assessment that \"all options are on the table\'\' when dealing with Kim Jong Un and announced new sanctions against several dozen North Korea individuals. Japan is already seeking money to purchase upgraded SM3 interceptors with greater accuracy and range, as well as other advanced missile defense systems such as land-based Aegis Ashore interceptors or the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, a US mobile anti-missile system installed in South Korea. An installment of THAAD in Japan would further escalate reaction from Beijing, which has already balked at the installment of THAAD in South Korea, saying its advanced radar system can monitor deep into China. Trump and Abe have struck a strong friendship, forged in meetings, phone calls and on the golf course a friendship that was on display at a Monday evening banquet that was the final event of Trump\'s visit. Abe called Trump his \"dear friend\'\' and hailed the benefits of what he called \"golf diplomacy.\'\' The two men on Monday also put a face on the threat posed by the North, earlier standing with anguished families of Japanese citizens snatched by Pyongyang\'s agents. Trump and first lady Melania Trump stood with nearly two dozen relatives, some of whom held photos of the missing. Seeking to increase pressure on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Trump pledged to work to return the missing to their families, saying \"it\'s a very, very sad number of stories that we\'ve heard.\'\' North Korea has acknowledged apprehending 13 Japanese in the 1970s and 1980s, but claims they all died or have been released. But in Japan, where grieving relatives of the abducted have become a symbol of heartbreak on the scale of American POW families, the government insists many more were taken and that some may still be alive. Though Trump and Abe repeatedly touted their friendship, looming disagreements on trade could strain the friendship. Trump complained Monday that Japan had been ``winning\'\' for decades and rebuked the current relationship, saying the trade deals were ``not fair and not open.\'\' He told a group of American and Japanese business leaders: the United States was open for business, but he wanted to reshape the nations\' trade relationship, though he did not say how he would cut the trade deficit with Japan, which totaled nearly $70 billion last year. He also downplayed the potentially contentious nature of the negotiations, though the Japanese government has not shown much appetite for striking a new bilateral trade agreement. Tokyo had pushed to preserve the Trans- Pacific Partnership, which Trump has abandoned. ``We will have more trade than anybody ever thought under TPP. That I can tell you,\'\' Trump said. He said the multinational agreement was not the right deal for the United States and that while ``probably some of you in this room disagree ... ultimately I\'ll be proven to be right.\'\' Abe, for his part, publicly deflected questions about trade. Japan orchestrated a lavish formal welcome for the Trumps, complete with military honor guard and an audience with Japan\'s Emperor Akihito and his wife, Empress Michiko, at the Imperial Palace. As part of the pageantry, Trump and Abe took part in a traditional feeding of koi in a pond Monday. At first, both leaders spooned out small amounts of feed into the pond below. Abe then lightly tossed the remainder of his box into the pond below, while Trump more theatrically dumped the rest of his box down to the fish. Abe laughed.

'SEOUL: President Donald Trump, on his first day on the Korean peninsula, signaled a willingness to negotiate with North Korea to end its nuclear weapons program, urging Pyongyang to \"come to the table\" and \"make a deal.\" In a notable shift from his aggressive rhetoric toward North Korea, Trump took a more optimistic tone Tuesday, suggesting that \"ultimately, it\'ll all work out.\" And while he said the United States would use military force if needed, he expressed his strongest inclination yet to deal with rising tensions with Pyongyang through diplomacy. \"It makes sense for North Korea to come to the table and make a deal that is good for the people of North Korea and for the world,\'\' Trump said during a news conference alongside South Korean president Moon Jae-in. \"I do see certain movement.\" Trump said he\'s seen \"a lot of progress\'\' in dealing with North Korea though he stopped short of saying whether he wanted direct diplomatic talks. Trump also underlined the United States\' military options, noting that three aircraft carrier groups and a nuclear submarine had been deployed to the region. But he said ``we hope to God we never have to use\'\' the military options. During his first day in South Korea, Trump lowered the temperature on his previously incendiary language about North Korea. There were no threats of unleashing ``fire and fury\'\' on the North, as Trump previously warned, nor did the president revive his derisive nickname for North Korean dictator Kim Jung Un, ``Little Rocket Man.\'\' But he did decree that the dictator is ``threatening millions and millions of lives, so needlessly\'\' and highlighted one of the central missions of his first lengthy Asia trip: to enlist many nations in the region, including China and Russia, to cut off Pyongyang\'s economic lifeblood and pressure it into giving up its nuclear program. Moon, who has been eager to solidify a friendship with Trump, said he hoped the president\'s visit would be a moment of inflection in the stand-off with North Korea and said the two leaders had ``agreed to resolve the North Korea nuclear issue in peaceful manner\'\' that would ``bring permanent peace\'\' to the peninsula. ``I know that you have put this issue at the top of your security agenda,\'\' said Moon. ``So I hope that your visit to Korea and to the Asia Pacific region will serve as an opportunity to relieve some of the anxiety that the Korean people have due to North Korea\'s provocations and also serve as a turning point in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue.\'\' When presidents travel overseas, every word is parsed and every action studied. That scrutiny will be intensified in South Korea, Trump\'s second stop on his lengthy Asia trip, where he will try to reassure Seoul while risking antagonizing Pyongyang. Trump has suggested that even while in range of Pynogyang\'s missiles, he will not change his inflammatory rhetoric, which has included deriding Kim Jong Un as ``Little Rocket Man.\'\' He began with a visit to Camp Humphreys, a joint US-Korean military base, but even as he walked among the weapons of war, he struck a hopeful note, saying: ``it always works out.\'\' Much like he did in his visit to Japan, Trump indicated he would place the interlocking issues of security and trade at the heart of his visit. He praised South Korea for significant purchases of American military equipment and urged the two nations to have more equitable trade relationship. Moon said the two agreed on lifting the warhead payload limits on South Korean ballistic missiles and cooperating on strengthening South Korea\'s defense capabilities through the acquisition or development of advanced weapons systems. Trump also pushed his economic agenda, saying that the current US-Korea trade agreement was ``not successful and not very good for the United States.\'\' But he said that he had a ``terrific\'\' meeting scheduled on trade, adding, ``hopefully that\'ll start working out and working out so that we create lots of jobs in the United States, which is one of the very important reasons I\'m here.\'\' At Camp Humphreys, Trump shook hands with American and Korean service members and sat with troops for lunch in a large mess hall U.S. and South Korean officials have said the base visit was meant to underscore the countries\' ties and South Korea\'s commitment to contributing to its own defense. Burden-sharing is a theme Trump has stressed ever since his presidential campaign. But Trump is skipping the customary trip to the demilitarized zone separating north and south _ a pilgrimage made by every U.S. president except one since Ronald Reagan as a demonstration of solidarity with the South. Trump has not ruled out a military strike and backed up his strong words about North Korea by sending a budget request to Capitol Hill on Monday for $4 billion to support ``additional efforts to detect, defeat, and defend against any North Korean use of ballistic missiles against the United States, its deployed forces, allies, or partners.\'\' The other question looming over the visit is Trump\'s relationship with Moon, with whom he does not nearly share the close friendship he has with Abe. Trump and Moon agree on the need to pressure the North with sanctions and other deterrence measures. But Trump has threatened to ``totally destroy\'\' the North, if necessary, repeatedly insisted that all options are on the table and suggested that Moon was being too lenient on the north. Moon, meanwhile, favors dialogue as the best strategy for defusing the nuclear tension and vehemently opposes a potential military clash that could cause enormous casualties in South Korea. But Moon played the gracious host Tuesday. Following the example set by Japan and other countries that have welcomes Trump with lavish greetings, Moon rolled out an elaborate greeting for the president, including an elaborate ceremony featuring colorful costumes and flags at South Korea\'s stately presidential residence known as the Blue House. And he made a point of saluting the recent gains of the U.S. stock market, a favorite Trump talking point, and congratulating the president ahead of the one-year anniversary of his election.

'TOKYO: Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says the threat from North Korea is the most serious security concern his country has faced since World War II and has pledged to bolster defence measures. Outlining priorities in his policy speech in parliament Friday, Abe called North Korea\'s sixth nuclear test and missiles that flew over Japan earlier this year \"a national crisis.\" Abe says Japan will take \"concrete actions\'\' under the Japan-US alliance in order to respond to any emergency amid Pyongyang\'s \"escalating provocation.\'\' He says Japan will further strengthen its missile defense capability. Japan\'s defense spending has steadily increased since Abe took office in 2012. Tokyo has said it plans to buy more American missile defense systems.

'PYONGYANG: Ever so cautiously, North Korea is going online. Doctors can consult via live, online video conferencing, and lectures at prestigious Kim Il Sung University are streamed to faraway factories and agricultural communes. People use online dictionaries and text each other on their smart phones. In the wallets of the privileged are \"Jonsong\" or \"Narae\" cards for e-shopping and online banking. Cash registers at major department stores are plugged into the web. It\'s just not the World Wide Web. This is all done on a tightly sealed intranet of the sort a medium-sized company might use for its employees. The free flow of information is anathema to authoritarian regimes, and with the possible exception of the African dictatorship of Eritrea, North Korea is still the least Internet-friendly country on Earth. Access to the global Internet for most is unimaginable. Hardly anyone has a personal computer or an email address that isn\'t shared, and the price for trying to get around the government\'s rules can be severe. But for Kim Jong Un, the country\'s first leader to come of age with the Internet, the idea of a more wired North Korea is also attractive. It comes with the potential for great benefits to the nation from information technology — and for new forms of social and political control that promise to be more effective than anything his father and grandfather could have dreamed of. It also allows for the possibility of cyber-attacks on the West. Pyongyang\'s solution is a two-tiered system where the trusted elite can surf the Internet with relative freedom while the masses are kept inside the national intranet, painstakingly sealed off from the outside world, meticulously surveilled and built in no small part on pilfered software. The regime created, in other words, an online version of North Korea itself. Surfing the intranet Rising from Ssuk Island in the Taedong River, which divides Pyongyang east and west, is a building shaped like a colossal atom. The \"knowledge sector\" is a key priority for Kim Jong Un, and the sprawling, glassy Sci-Tech Complex, a center for the dissemination of science-related information throughout the country, is one of his signature development projects. It houses North Korea\'s biggest e-library, with more than 3,000 terminals where factory workers participate in tele-learning, kids in their bright red scarves watch cartoons and university students do research. Pak Sung Jin, a 30-year-old postgraduate in chemistry, came to work on an essay. It\'s a weekday and the e-library is crowded. Unlike most North Koreans, Pak has some experience with the Internet, though on a supervised, need-only basis. If Pak needs anything from the Internet, accredited university officials will find it for him. As a scholar and a scientist, Pak says, it\'s his patriotic duty to be on top of the most up-to-date research. He echoes the official condemnation that the Internet has been poisoned by the American imperialists and their stooges. \"There ought to be a basic acceptance the Internet should be used peacefully,\" he says. Today, he is relying on the Internet\'s North Korean alter ego, the national intranet. Below a red label that states his black \"Ullim\" desktop computer was donated by Dear Respected Leader Kim Jong Un, what\'s on Pak\'s screen is for North Korean eyes only. The IP address, 10.76.1.11, indicates he\'s on the walled-off network North Koreans call \"Kwangmyong,\" which means brightness or light. Using the \"Naenara\" browser — the name means \"my country\" but it\'s a modified version of FireFox — Pak visits a restaurant page, his university website, and cooking and online shopping sites. There are very few actual sites on Kwangmyong. An official at the Sci-Tech Center said they number 168. They are spread across separate networks for government agencies, schools and libraries, and companies. It\'s all domestically run, though government-approved content culled from the Internet can be posted by administrators, primarily for researchers like Pak. North Korea\'s national intranet concept is unique and extreme even when compared with other information-wary countries. China and Cuba, for example, are well known for the extent of control the government exerts over what citizens can see. But that is done primarily through censorship and blocking, not complete separation. Like most North Korean computers, the desktops at the Sci-Tech Complex run on the \"Red Star\" operating system, which was developed by the Korea Computer Center from Linux open-source coding. Red Star 3.0 has the usual widgets: the Naenara browser, email, a calendar and time zone settings, even \"kPhoto\" (with an icon that looks a lot like iPhoto). Older versions featured a Windows XP user interface but it now it has a Mac design, right down to the \"spinning beach ball\" wait icon. Versions of Red Star that have made it out of North Korea and into the hands of foreign coding experts also reveal some rather sinister, and for most users invisible, features. Any attempt to change its core functions or disable virus checkers results in an automatic reboot cycle. Files downloaded from USBs are watermarked so that authorities can identify and trace criminal or subversive activity, a security measure that takes aim at the spread of unauthorized content from South Korea, China and elsewhere. Red Star also uses a trace viewer that takes regular screenshots of what is being displayed. The screenshots can\'t be deleted or accessed by the typical user but are available for checking if a trained government official decides to take a look. Outside North Korea, Android phones have a similar trace-viewer feature, noted Will Scott, who taught computer science at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology in 2013 and is now a doctoral student at the University of Washington. But the Red Star version reflects the regime\'s very specific surveillance and violation-busting priorities. It doesn\'t collect much more than the Android would; however, it is designed to make getting at that information easier for a local authority who isn\'t an expert programmer. Scott said the North has been \"very effective\" in using such technology to serve its goals. Nat Kretchun, deputy director of the Open Technology Fund, said the kinds of censorship and surveillance software in Red Star and the mobile operating systems of phones and tablets reveal a new information control strategy. Under Kim Jong Un\'s predecessors, the flow of information was primarily controlled through a resource-intensive human network — the State Security Ministry\'s \"thought police,\" for example, or Pyongyang\'s iconic traffic controllers — that kept tabs on what people were up to. But the advent of the Internet and advances in communication technology poked holes in that strategy, particularly among the better educated, younger and more affluent, the very segment of society that could be most likely to pose a political threat. So, while maintaining its old school tactics on the ground and enforcing the blackout of the global Internet, North Korean officials have learned to adapt by using the online devices themselves as yet another tool for surveillance. \"In North Korea cell phones and intranet-enabled devices are on balance pro-surveillance and control,\" said Kretchun, who has been studying North Korea\'s relationship to the Internet for years. The Azalea smart phone and the Ryonghung ipad The most common online experience for North Koreans isn\'t on a laptop or desktop. It\'s on a smart phone. A decade ago, only a small cadre of select regime and military officials had access to smart phones. Now, according to the main provider\'s most recent financial reports, there are an estimated 2.5-3 million mobile phones in North Korea, a country of 25 million. The rapid spread of mobile phones is one of the biggest success stories of the Kim Jong Un era. After a couple of false starts, the North\'s foray into mobile telecoms began in earnest in 2008 under Kim Jong Il. But it has truly blossomed over the past five years with the introduction of 3G services, thanks in large part to two foreign investors — Loxley Pacific of Thailand and Egypt\'s Orascom Telecom Media and Technology. Like the walled-off intranet, North Korea\'s phones deny access to the outside world. Local phones allow North Koreans to call and text each other, play games, surf the domestic intranet and access some other services. Users have hundreds of ring tones to choose from, and can get weather updates, look words up in dictionaries and snap selfies. But they cannot receive or place calls to numbers outside that network — the rest of the world, in other words. It\'s easy enough for North Koreans to buy phones, though the phones must be registered and approved. A good \"Pyongyang\" or \"Arirang\" model smart phone costs from $200 to $400. More basic phones go for much less, especially if the phone is second-hand. On the second floor of the Pottonggang IT center, a clerk stands behind a glass display cabinet filled with tablets and USB flash drives. Signs on the wall behind her advertise anti-virus software and apps to put on mobile phones, which they can do by Bluetooth at the store. One of the most popular apps is a role playing game based on \"Boy General,\" a locally created hit anime series. It costs $1.80. Foreigners in North Korea are relegated to a different network and cannot make calls to, or receive calls from, local numbers. They can buy local phones if they want, but the devices will be stripped of the apps and features that they normally carry and securely coded so that the apps can\'t be added on later. Wi-fi use is banned for North Koreans, and tightly restricted and monitored to block surreptitious piggybacking on foreigners\' signals. North Korea undoubtedly imports and rebrands some of its IT products. But over the past few months, two companies have generated quite a stir among Apple fans with products billed to be wholly domestic: the \"Jindallae (Azalea) III\" mobile phone and the \"Ryonghung iPad.\" The gadgets\' insouciant similarity to Apple products, and the flat-out appropriation of the \"iPad\" name, isn\'t especially surprising. Kim Jong Un likes Apple products — he has been photographed with a MacBook Pro on his private jet, and even had a 21-inch iMac on the desk beside him when state media showed him reviewing a nuclear \"US mainland strike plan\" four years ago. It seems North Korean coders have also lifted some ideas from Apple. Outside experts believe a program similar to what Apple uses in its OS X and iOS is believed to be the basis of the booby-trap that thwarts attempts to disable security functions in Red Star. It\'s now a staple on North Korean phones. And by 2014, all mobile phone operating systems had been updated to include the watermarking system to reject apps or media that don\'t carry a government signature of approval. It\'s the same mechanism used by Apple to block unauthorized applications from the App Store, but in North Korea\'s case serves instead to control access to information. \"The stakes are infinitely higher in North Korea, where communications are monitored and being caught talking about the wrong thing could land you in a political prison camp,\" Kretchun noted. Wired elites and cybersoldiers While blocking off the masses, North Korea allows more Internet access to a small segment of society, including the country\'s elite and its cybersoldier s. To create a snapshot of the online behavior of the elite, US-based cyber threat intelligence company Recorded Future and Team Cymru, a non-profit Internet security group, analyzed activity in IP ranges believed to be used by North Korea from April to July this year. They found that the limited number of North Koreans with access to the Internet are much more active and engaged in the world and with contemporary services and technologies than many outsiders had previously thought, according to Priscilla Moriuchi, Recorded Future\'s director of strategic threat development and a former NSA agent. \"North Korean leaders are not disconnected from the world and the consequences of their actions,\" she said. How deep the access goes isn\'t known. Recorded Future and Team Cymru officials contacted by The AP refused to comment on details of their dataset, including how many \"elite\" users were observed and how foreign tourists or residents in the North were excluded. Even so, it stands to reason at least some members of the North Korean leadership have the access they need to keep up on world events and that specialist agents are allowed to monitor and cull intelligence from the internet. There is also strong evidence that North Korea allows people involved in hacking or cyber operations the access necessary for a deep engagement in cyberattacks and cybercrime. According to the FBI, the North\'s bigger hacks include the recent WannaCry ransomware attack, which infected hundreds of thousands of computers in May and crippled parts of Britain\'s National Health Service. It has been linked to attacks on the Bangladeshi central bank last year and on banks in South Korea going back to 2013. There was also the 2014 hack of Sony Pictures over the release of the \"Interview,\" a black comedy that graphically portrayed Kim Jong Un being killed. US authorities recently dubbed North Korea\'s cyber presence \"Hidden Cobra.\" Weaponizing cyberspace is a logical option for the North because it can be done at relatively low cost and at the same time denied, according to a Congressional report submitted in August. Pyongyang has denied hacking allegations, but the ability to carry out sophisticated cyber operations is a powerful military weapon in the hands of a state. Just as assuredly as North Korea is developing its nuclear and missile capabilities, most experts assume, it\'s honing its cyber warfare tool box. Beau Woods, the deputy director of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council, cautioned of a \"preponderance of question marks\" regarding North Korea\'s cyber skills. But he warned of how potentially devastating a more cyber-active North Korea could be. Those concerns are turned on their head back at the Sci-Tech Center in Pyongyang. Pak, the chemist, supports the official line in North Korea that the increasing danger of cyberattacks and slanderous Internet propaganda comes from the US against Pyongyang. The government says that justifies \"protective\" walls to shield the masses from aggressive propaganda, and virtually requires extensive cybersecurity measures in the name of national defense. \"Don\'t you see how severe the anti-Republic slander of our enemies on the Internet is?\" Pak said, although the restrictive policies make it difficult for him to carry out his research. \"There are a lot of cases where the Internet is being used to raise hostility against us.\" Get latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.',real
'HANOI: US President Donald Trump was due to land in Hanoi on Saturday, as North Korea slammed his \"warmonger\" Asia tour, saying it will only accelerate Pyongyang\'s push for a full-fledged nuclear deterrent. Trump has repeatedly railed against the North as he urges the region to take a united front against the threat posed by the isolated nation, which has sparked global alarm with nuclear and missile tests in recent months. On Friday he warned world leaders gathered in the Vietnamese resort city of Danang that the Asia-Pacific region \"must not be held hostage to a dictator\'s twisted fantasies\". Pyongyang issued its retort on Saturday branding Trump\'s Asia tour a \"warmonger\'s visit for confrontation to rid the DPRK of its self-defensive nuclear deterrence\", in the first comments on the visit by a North Korean official. Tensions over the North\'s weapons programme have surged in recent months, as Pyongyang carried out a sixth nuclear test -- by far its largest to date -- and test fired dozens of missiles, some capable of reaching the US mainland. North Korea has dominated Trump\'s trip, which has so far swept in Japan, South Korea, China and Vietnam. In a speech to the South Korean parliament on Wednesday, Trump warned Pyongyang not to underestimate the United States, while offering leader Kim Jong-Un a better future if he gives up his nuclear ambitions. The North on Saturday said Trump\'s warnings \"can never frighten us or put a stop to our advance\", according to the state-run KCNA news agency, quoting a Pyongyang foreign ministry spokesman. Instead the threat \"pushes us to speed up the efforts to accomplish the great cause of completing the state nuclear force\", the statement said, dismissing Trump\'s tour of the region as a \"business trip\". Rewriting America\'s trade relations with the Asia-Pacific region has been Trump\'s other core message, giving ample airing to his \"America First\" mantra. The combative billionaire-turned-president accused the region of taking advantage of US largesse in rules-based trade deals while retooling their own economies with \"unfair\" subsidies and protected markets. He is set to land in Vietnam\'s capital Hanoi where he will meet its Communist leadership, following his meetings with global leaders at the APEC summit in Danang. Vietnam has eagerly courted trade and investment with the US since Trump\'s election, more so after he yanked the US from a key Pacific Rim trade pact, taking with him low tariff access to the world\'s largest market. The former wartime foes became friends under Trump\'s predecessor Barack Obama, who embraced Vietnam as part of his strategic pivot to Asia, which sought to counterbalance China\'s rise. But Obama also delivered harsh warnings on the one-party state\'s dismal rights record. Those are likely to be muted as Trump seeks to use the US\' enormous economic heft to build bilateral trade deals. He has already binned US participation the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the cornerstone of Obama\'s Asia embrace which Trump pulled out of in January. Vietnam stood to gain enormously from the deal before the US pullout, opening the door to America\'s huge market for its cheaply manufactured goods. Though Trump is not as revered in Vietnam as his predecessor, a Pew survey last week found 58 per cent of Vietnamese respondents have confidence in him. Trump will attend a state banquet on Saturday before a welcoming and deal-signing ceremony on Sunday morning. He leaves for the Philippines on Sunday afternoon where he will attend the ASEAN summit of Southeast Asian leaders.

'SEOUL: North Korea slammed US President Donald Trump as \"incurably mentally deranged\" in a personal diatribe ahead of his first visit to Asia as head of state, amid high tensions over Pyongyang\'s nuclear ambitions. Trump and the North\'s leader Kim Jong-Un have traded threats of war and personal insults against each other in recent months, heightening worries about a potential conflict on the divided Korean peninsula. Trump has warned of \"fire and fury\" and \"calm before the storm\", telling the UN General Assembly that Washington would \"totally destroy North Korea\" if it had to defend itself or its allies. He dubbed Kim \"Rocket Man\" in the same speech -- Pyongyang has tested missiles apparently capable of reaching much of the US mainland -- and days later Kim responded with a personal statement calling Trump a \"dotard\", an obscure term for a weak or senile old man. The US president is due in Asia at the weekend and ahead of his arrival the North\'s state-run KCNA news agency lashed out at \"bellicose and irresponsible rhetoric\" by the \"master of invective\". \"He absolutely needs medicine for curing his psychical disorder,\" it said. The US has deployed key military assets including jet fighters and aircraft carriers near the peninsula following the North\'s sixth nuclear test in September, which also saw the United Nations impose an eighth set of sanctions on the isolated country. KCNA described the sanctions drive as \"desperate efforts\" that would prove ineffective and Trump\'s hostile rhetoric as \"hysteric spasmodic symptoms\". Trump, it said late Tuesday, \"disclosed his true nature as a nuclear war maniac before the world and was diagnosed as \'incurably mentally deranged\'\". Trump\'s itinerary includes Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines, with all eyes on his message to the North and Kim. Pyongyang says it needs nuclear weapons to defend itself against possible invasion by the US. During a November 7-8 visit to the South -- a security ally of Washington that hosts 28,500 US troops -- Trump is due to address Seoul\'s parliament and visit a US military base, although he will not go to the Demilitarized Zone that divides the Koreas.

'SEOUL: North Korea\'s state media on Wednesday slammed Donald Trump for insulting leader Kim Jong-un, saying the US president deserved the death penalty and calling him a coward for cancelling a visit to the inter-Korean border. An editorial in the ruling party newspaper Rodong Sinmun focused its anger on Trump\'s visit to South Korea last week, during which he denounced the North\'s \"cruel dictatorship\" in a speech to legislators in Seoul. The visit was part of a marathon five-nation Asia tour by the US president aimed largely at galvanising regional opposition to the North\'s nuclear weapons ambitions. \"The worst crime for which he can never be pardoned is that he dared [to] malignantly hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership,\" the editorial said. \"He should know that he is just a hideous criminal sentenced to death by the Korean people,\" it added. Since becoming president, Trump has engaged in an escalating war of words with Kim Jong-un, trading personal insults and threats of military strikes and raising concerns about an outbreak of hostilities. Towards the end of his Asia tour, he sent a tweet from Hanoi that took the verbal jousting to a new level, taunting the North Korean leader over his height and weight. \"Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me \'old,\' when I would NEVER call him \'short and fat\'?\" he tweeted. The members of the ruling Kim dynasty -- past and present -- enjoy near god-like status in North Korea, which has demonstrated extreme sensitivity to any remark that might be seen as mocking or disrespectful of the leadership. The editorial also took a dig at Trump\'s failure to tour the demilitarised zone (DMZ) dividing the two Koreas -- a traditional stop-off for senior US officials visiting the South. Trump\'s helicopter taking him to the DMZ had turned back after just five minutes due to bad weather -- an explanation the newspaper dismissed. \"It wasn\'t the weather,\" the editorial said: \"He was just too scared to face the glaring eyes of our troops.\" Get latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.',real
'SEOUL: North Korea said on Saturday that US President Donald Trump\'s first trip to Asia showed he was a \"destroyer\" and he had begged for war on the Korean peninsula. \"Trump, during his visit, laid bare his true nature as destroyer of world peace and stability and begged for a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula,\" the foreign ministry spokesman said in a statement carried by the state news agency. Trump had warned North Korea+ on Wednesday not to underestimate the United States as he wrapped up his visit to South Korea. The North Korean spokesman said nothing would deter Pyongyang from pursuing its nuclear weapons programme. Tensions over North Korea\'s weapons programme have surged in recent months, as Pyongyang carried out a sixth nuclear test — by far its largest to date — and test fired dozens of missiles, some capable of reaching the US mainland.

'TOKYO: The time for \"strategic patience\" with North Korea is over, President Donald Trump said Monday, after winning Japan\'s backing on his policy of considering all options to rein in the rogue state. Trump has signalled in the past that Washington could look beyond a diplomatic solution to the North\'s nuclear weapons ambitions, and consider military intervention. The North\'s nuclear programme is \"a threat to the civilised world and international peace and stability,\" Trump told reporters on the second day of a trip to Asia dominated by the crisis. \"The era of strategic patience is over,\" he declared alongside his host, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The hawkish Abe, whose own nation has seen North Korean missiles fired over its northern island amid threats by Pyongyang to \"sink\" it into the sea, backed the bullish stance. \"We always support President Trump\'s policy that all options are on the table,\" in reining in North Korea over its provocative actions involving its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, he said. Abe announced Japan will freeze the assets of 35 North Korean groups and individuals as a new sanction. The United Nations has adopted multiple rounds of sanctions against the reclusive North, the most recent in September following its sixth nuclear test and a flurry of missile launches. Abe said the additional measures were aimed at punishing the North over its weapons program, as well as to attempt to resolve the issue of civilian abductions that took place in the 1970s and \'80s. A number of ordinary Japanese citizens were kidnapped by North Korean agents in that era, in order to train spies in Japanese language and culture. Trump will later Monday sit down with an elderly couple whose then 13-year-old daughter, Megumi Yokota, was kidnapped four decades ago while on her way home from school. The president arrived in Asia with tensions over North Korea at fever pitch, as US bombers fly sorties over the Korean peninsula and concerns mount that Pyongyang might stage another nuclear or missile test. Trump began his marathon trip in belligerent form, warning on Sunday that \"no dictator\" should underestimate US resolve, a clear swipe at North Korea and its young leader Kim Jong-Un. However in a pre-recorded interview broadcast on US TV he held out the prospect of talks with Pyongyang, saying he would \"certainly be open\" to meeting Kim. \"I would sit down with anybody,\" he said. \"I don\'t think it\'s strength or weakness, I think sitting down with people is not a bad thing,\" he said on the \"Full Measure\" show. \"So I would certainly be open to doing that but we\'ll see where it goes, I think we\'re far too early.\" Get latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.',real
'TOKYO: More than 200 people are feared to have died when a tunnel caved in at North Korea\'s nuclear test site after its latest detonation, a Japanese news report said on Tuesday. A tunnel collapsed at Punggye-ri in early September, days after North Korea conducted its sixth and largest underground nuclear test on September 3, TV Asahi said, quoting unnamed North Korean sources. Some 100 workers were involved in an initial collapse. Another cave-in occurred during rescue operations, leaving at least 200 people feared dead in total, the Japanese broadcaster said. The accident was triggered by the test, TV Asahi added. Experts have warned that the underground tests could cause the mountain to collapse and leak radiation into the atmosphere near China\'s border. The latest test — the sixth at the site since 2006 — triggered landslides in the detonation area and beyond, according to satellite pictures taken the day after. The images published by the 38 North website showed changes in the surface at Punggye-ri where the ground had been lifted into the air by the tremors. Small landslides followed the course of stream beds. The blast caused a 6.3-magnitude earthquake, according to the US Geological Survey, followed a few minutes later by another with a magnitude of 4.1. Japan assessed the yield from the test of what the North said was a hydrogen bomb at 120 kilotons, eight times the size of Hiroshima in 1945. It is very unusual for North Korea to acknowledge any major accident, especially anything that involves its nuclear programme. Lee Eugene, a spokeswoman at South Korea\'s unification ministry, said: \"We are aware of the report but do not know anything about it.\" The report came ahead of US President Donald Trump\'s first presidential visit to South Korea next week amid an escalating war of words between him and North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un. The reclusive country has made significant strides in its atomic and missile technology under Kim, who took power after the death of his father and longtime ruler Kim Jong-Il in 2011. Since then he has overseen four of the country\'s six nuclear tests and hailed atomic weapons as a \"treasured sword\" to protect the nation from invasion by the United States.

'NEW DELHI: Defectors from North Korea have routinely spoken about the endemic poverty and chronic hunger that the have-nots in the isolationist country suffer from. In a closed economy burdened by harsh UN sanctions, North Koreans often subsist on rice topped with \"injogogi\" or man-made meat, a Reuters report has revealed. In spite of a Public Distribution System (PDS) which guarantees ration coupons to 70 per cent of the population, over 61 per cent North Koreans still depend on informal, private markets as their most important source of food. Official channels like PDS accounted for just 23.5 per cent of people\'s food intake, a 2015 survey of defectors said. These private markets have a robust street food culture, which have become staples of North Korean diet. From injogogi, a fake meat made from pressing and rolling soy bean oil residue, to speed cakes - cornmeal sweets which don\'t require baking, these foods have a high protein and fibre content to help muscle growth and keep hunger at bay. A photo illustration shows \'Injogogi\' at a North Korean food store run by a defector in Seoul, South Korea (Reuters photo) It is no surprise then that the average North Korean is undernourished. A study conducted in 2009 showed that pre-school children in the North were up to 13 cm shorter and up to 7 kg lighter than their South Korean counterparts. According to UN food agency the World Food Programme (WFP), North Korea has received $42 million in food aid, a significant chunk of the $76 million \"nutritional support\" fund raised by member states. The agency also points out that North Koreans have a \"monotonous diet - mainly rice/maize, kimchi and bean paste - lacking in essential fats and protein.\" North Korean defector Hong Eun-hye demonstrates how North Korean people make rice cakes with corn powder. (Reuters photo) Some defectors said that despite global sanctions, food supply has improved under the regime of Kim Jong Un, who eased the restrictions on private trade after coming to power in 2011. Wealtheir defectors have attested that they ate meat on a frequent basis. Pork is common, but some also talked of eating dog meat, rabbit, and badger. On the other hand, their less well-off counterparts consumed privately grown vegetables and corn, a cheaper alternative to rice. In sharp contrast, the moneyed middle-class enjoys delicacies like pepperoni pizzas and spaghetti vongole at the many state-owned restaurants in the capital, which also cater to tourists. Influential people in Pyongyang have a versatile diet, thanks to bribes of goat meat, dog meat and deer meat, claimed a defector whose father was a high-ranking public official.

'SHANGHAI: A senior Chinese envoy has met an aide to North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un in Pyongyang, the two sides said Saturday, stressing long-standing ties despite deep divisions over the North\'s nuclear activities. Song Tao is visiting on behalf of President Xi Jinping, ostensibly to brief the North\'s officials on the recent Chinese Communist Party congress and other \"issues of mutual interest\". The two communist neighbours, once said by Mao Zedong to be \"as close as lips and teeth\", are at odds over the nuclear standoff and US President Donald Trump is urging Beijing to pile pressure on Pyongyang. Song, the first senior Chinese envoy to visit in more than a year, had been widely expected to raise the impasse over North Korea\'s missile and nuclear tests in his Friday meeting with Choe Ryong-Hae, a top official in North Korea\'s ruling party. But a Chinese Communist Party report of the meeting made no mention of those issues, focusing instead on platitudes about the long relationship. A party statement said Song and Choe agreed that mutual ties were \"the common treasure of the two peoples\". \"Both parties should make concerted efforts to promote the development of the relations between the two parties and the two countries and let them benefit the two peoples,\" the statement paraphrased them as saying. A brief report by North Korea\'s state-run KCNA news agency said Song told his hosts that China wanted to \"develop the traditional friendly relations between the two parties and countries\", but gave no further details. Trump, who warned Xi during his trip to Beijing last week that time was \"quickly running out\" to solve the nuclear crisis, took to Twitter on Thursday to hail Song\'s mission as \"a big move, we\'ll see what happens!\" The United States wants China, which accounts for 90 percent of North Korea\'s foreign trade, to apply more economic pressure. But experts doubt Song\'s visit will yield breakthroughs, saying Beijing has far less political influence on Kim than is thought despite the economic ties. \"Relations are extremely stressed. Perhaps the lowest point since the Korean War. Perhaps (the mission) will put a floor under China-North Korea relations, preventing further deterioration,\" said Bonnie Glaser, China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. China has imposed its own banking restrictions on North Koreans in addition to enacting a series of UN measures that include bans on imports of coal, iron ore and seafood from the North. But Beijing fears that squeezing Pyongyang too hard would cause its collapse. Analysts say Song\'s trip is probably aimed more at urging Kim\'s regime not to escalate tensions rather than applying real pressure for disarmament.

'WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump has vowed not to allow the \"twisted dictatorship\" in North Korea to hold the world hostage to \"nuclear blackmail\" as he pledged a global campaign of \"maximum pressure\" to denuclearise Pyongyang+ . Tensions have dramatically risen on the Korean peninsula after North Korea in September conducted its biggest nuclear test, which its state-run KCNA news agency described as a hydrogen bomb. In a televised address to the nation after his 12-day maiden trip to Asia, Trump said North Korea was on the top of his priority list. During his trip to China, Trump said Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged to faithfully implement UN Security Council resolutions on North Korea and to use his great economic influence over the regime to achieve their common goal of a denuclearised Korean Peninsula. \" President Xi recognises that a nuclear North Korea is a grave threat+ to China,\" he said. \"We agreed that we would not accept a so-called \'freeze for freeze\' agreement like those that have consistently failed in the past. We made that time is running out and we made it clear, and all options remain on the table,\" Trump said. The US president said during his address at the national assembly of South Korea, he \"made clear that we will not allow this twisted dictatorship (in North Korea) to hold the world hostage to nuclear blackmail.\" Trump and North Korean supreme leader Kim Jong-Un have traded increasingly threatening and personal insults as Pyongyang races towards its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the US. \"I called on every nation, including China and Russia, to unite in isolating the North Korean regime — cutting off all ties of trade and commerce — until it stops its dangerous provocation on — and this is the whole key to what we\'re doing — on denuclearisation. We have to denuclearise North Korea,\" Trump said. \"We have ended the failed strategy of strategic patience, and, as a result, we have already seen important progress — including tough new sanctions from the UN council — we have a Security Council that has been with us and just about with us from the beginning,\" the US president said. South Korea agreed to harmonise sanctions and joined the US in sanctioning additional rogue actors whose funds have helped North Korea and its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes,\" he said. \"It\'s unacceptable to us,\" he added. The US welcomed the decision of President Moon Jae-in to remove the payload restrictions on missiles to combat the North Korean threat. \"Together we reaffirmed our commitment to a campaign of maximum pressure,\" he said. Trump said at all the summits and throughout the trip, he asked all nations to support his campaign of \"maximum pressure\" for North Korean denuclearisation. \"They are responding by cutting trade with North Korea, restricting financial ties to the regime, and expelling North Korean diplomats and workers,\" he said. Trump travelled to Japan, South Korea and China for bilateral visits. He also travelled to Vietnam and Philippines to attend the APEC and East Asia Summits respectively. In Japan, Trump said he and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed on their absolute determination to remain united to achieve the goal of denuclearised North Korea. Shortly following his visit, Japan announced additional sanctions on 35 North Korean entities and individuals. Japan also committed to shouldering more of the burden of our common defence by reimbursing costs borne by American taxpayers, as well as by making deep investments in Japan\'s own military, he said. It will include purchases of US advanced capabilities -- from jet fighters to missile defence systems worth many, many billions of dollars - and jobs for the American worker, he added.

'SEOUL: A North Korean soldier involved in an extremely rare and dramatic defection to the South was shot six times by North Korean border troops as he dashed over the border, military officials and doctors said today. The US-led United Nations Command (UNC), which monitors the Panmunjom border truce village where the defection occurred Monday, said the soldier had driven close to the heavily-guarded, military demarcation line separating the two Koreas in a vehicle. \"He then exited the vehicle and continued fleeing south across the line as he was fired upon by other soldiers from North Korea,\" the UNC said in a statement. An official with the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said the North\'s border guards fired at least 40 rounds. A doctor treating the injured soldier — who was helicoptered to a hospital for emergency surgery — said he had been shot half-a-dozen times, including a serious stomach wound. \"He has at least six gunshot wounds on his body and the penetrating wound in the abdomen is the most serious\", the doctor, Lee Cook-Jong, told reporters. It is very rare for the North\'s troops to defect at the truce village, a major tourist attraction bisected by the demarcation line and the only part of the frontier where forces from the two sides come face-to-face. The fact that the defector drove to the border suggests he may not have been a member of the elite corps of North Korean troops posted to Panmunjom, who are carefully vetted and selected for their loyalty. No tourists were present at the time, because tours do not run on Mondays. According to the South Korean military there was no exchange of fire across the border, and the UNC statement stressed that no South Korean or US forces were harmed in the incident, which happened in broad daylight around 4:00pm. Unlike the rest of the frontier, Panmunjom is not fortified with minefields and barbed wire and the border is marked only by a low concrete divider. After racing across the border, the soldier took cover near a building on the South side. The Joint Chiefs of Staff official said he was found collapsed in a pile of fallen leaves and recovered by three South Korean soldiers crawling on their stomachs to his position. In 1984, a Soviet citizen sprinted across the border from North Korea to the South at Panmunjom in a defection bid, sparking a gunbattle that killed and wounded several soldiers on both sides. North Korean soldiers wielding axes hacked two US soldiers to death at Panmunjom in a 1976 brawl over an attempt to trim a tree there.

'SEOUL: North Korea\'s efforts to advance its nuclear arsenal will be \"front and center\" during talks with South Korean officials, US President Donald Trump said ahead of the bilateral meetings in Seoul on Tuesday. In recent months, Trump has criticized South Korea President Moon Jae-in over his support for diplomatic engagement with Pyongyang - something the US president once called \"appeasement\" - and has threatened to pull out of a free trade pact between the two countries. Trump said the talks would also address trade issues, including South Korea\'s acquisition of American defense equipment.

'A neighbor’s account indicates that a Northern California shooter who killed five people this week may have targeted an elementary school as part of his long-running feud with neighbors.Shooter Kevin Neal threatened out loud that he was going to kill Danny Elliott and then go to the elementary school to kill Elliott’s 7-year-old son, said Johnny Phommathep, a neighbor who lived about 200 feet away from Neal.He’d scream to him, ‘I’ma kill you, boy. I’ma learn you. Once I kill you, I’ma go kill your son at school,’ Phommathep told the Record Searchlight of Redding.The Tehama County Sheriff’s Office said Neal, 44, killed neighbor Danny Elliott and his mother, Diana Steele, in an apparent act of revenge before he shot randomly into vehicles and at people in this tiny, rural community about 130 miles (209 kilometers) north of Sacramento.Neal killed five people and wounded at least a dozen adults and children before authorities shot him dead during a rampage on Tuesday.The gunman rammed a car into the gates of Rancho Tehama Elementary School and shot at its portable classrooms. He tried repeatedly to get into a kindergarten classroom but quick-thinking staff had locked the school down, and he eventually stormed off.Assistant Sheriff Phil Johnston has said he wasn’t sure why Neal headed to the school, but Phommathep said Neal probably went there looking for Elliott’s son. The school has about 100 students, in kindergarten through fifth grades.Tehama County District Attorney Gregg Cohen also said through a spokeswoman Friday that he believes Neal targeted the school because of the child.Authorities found the bullet-riddled body of Neal’s wife under the floorboards of their home. They believe her slaying was the start of the rampage.Barbara Glisan was a North Carolina native who loved adventure, said Lesa Caves, a former college roommate. Caves said they once rode a roller coaster 10 times to get the perfect automated snapshot: Hands in the air, big smiles.They lost touch over the years but Caves, 37, said that about a year ago, Glisan started getting back in touch with friends from North Carolina.“She tried to reach out and reconnect with multiple people she had lost contact with,” Caves said. Phommathep’s wife and three of her children are among those wounded.Tiffany Phommathep, 31, was on her way to drop off their children at school when Neal pulled up next to her and sprayed bullets into her pickup. She told reporters from her hospital bed that she was hit four times in the back and shoulder and once in the stomach.She said she asked four people for help but none did. One woman told her she ‘couldn’t help me because she only had a two-seater and she was late for work,’ Phommathep said. “That hurt my heart a lot to hear her say that.”Johnston, the assistant sheriff, came across her and helped her, her husband said.At the time of the assault, Neal was out of custody on bail after being arrested in January and charged with stabbing Elliott’s girlfriend. She obtained a restraining order against Neal in February, stating that the household required protection.David Steele, who is Diana Steele’s stepson, said his father Bob is devastated. “If you have a restraining order on someone like that, he shouldn’t even be allowed to live in the area,” he said.',real
'NEW DELHI: The Centre expressed its helplessness on Monday to curb the menace of Blue Whale challenge, a deadly online game that has claimed lives of many youths, saying it was technically not possible to evolve a mechanism to block it. Appearing before a bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices AM Khanwilkar and DY Chandrachud, attorney general KK Venugopal contended that the Centre had conducted many brain-storming sessions with scientists, information techonology experts, internet and social media companies but the solution of the problem remained elusive. The government said that it did not have technological know-how to block the online game, saying \"it is believed that Blue Whale game was being communicated by one-to-one communication through encrypted/ secretive communication links\". Hence it is difficult to identify, intercept and analyze the contents.\" \"Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) approached leading academic, R&D institutions, cyber security organisations like Indrapastha Institute of Information Technology, CDAC, Amrita University , Indian Computer Emergency Response Team(CRET-In), Data Security Council of India(DSCI) etc to find out as to how children are accessing this game and what is the source of information. Base on their responses, MeitY was not able to find any absolute information about the source of information and the availability of the game on internet/ social media,\" the government said in its affidavit. What is the Blue Whale Challenge? 02:18 The Centre filed its response in compliance of SC order directing it to disclose actions taken by it to quell the spread of deadly game+ in the country. The bench had passed the order on a plea filed by advocate Sneha Kalita seeking direction to government to ban the game. The petitioner told the court that there was need to immediate ban and make awareness about Blue Whale game amongst the people specially, youngsters and at least 200 people had committed suicide after playing the online game. It said that the Centre had held discussion with Facebook, Google and other companies but they also expressed their inability to block the game. \"Specific information like website address/Internet Protocol Address/RL details are required to block/remove the content/Apps on Internet. In the Blue Whale game there is no formal application, website or URL. Hence it is very little scope for using technical solutions to identify or bloc the game. It is submitted that keyword based filtering would affect the other genuine information linked with such word,\" it said. As the Centre expressed inability to block the game, the Supreme Court said+ there was very little it could do in the case and disposed of the petition. It, however, directed chief secretaries of all states to spread awareness among students about the game to prevent them from playing the deadly game. The Centre also said that it had decided to pursue the policy of \"prevention is better than cure\" and issued circular to all schools regarding safe use of internet in educational institutions to prevent students from getting enticed to play the game. The governemnt has also suggested Facebook to take proactive steps to identify those users who are depressed and seek to play Blue Whale game and alerts local police.

'UNITED NATIONS: North Korea says the unprecedented deployment of three US aircraft carrier groups \"taking up a strike posture\" around the Korean peninsula is making it impossible to predict when nuclear war will break out.

'NEW DELHI: When India stood up against China\'s OBOR+ in May this year, it inserted a new thinking to the whole idea of connectivity as an instrument of foreign policy. Until then, connectivity was how China would build its way through Asia and Africa using highways and rail networks — its excess capacity and capital creating fabulous infrastructure and debt underbellies. India, too, used connectivity to further its own foreign policy, but not to the same effect. But as China continues to grow, connectivity as a foreign policy is being perceived as a certain threat by countries like India and Japan. Therefore, since this summer, India has pushed its own connectivity mantra with most of its international partners, but with very different rules from China. A cursory glance at joint statements between India and its international partners shows how New Delhi is trying to change the language of development aid and connectivity initiatives as well as getting its friends to agree. In its most recent statement with Italy, the two countries \"acknowledged the importance of connectivity in today\'s globalised world. They underlined that connectivity initiatives must be based on universally recognised international norms, good governance, rule of law, openness, transparency and equality and must follow principles of financial responsibility, accountable debt financing practices, balanced ecological and environmental protection, preservation standards and social sustainability.\" These are the contours of the Indian version of connectivity as compared to China\'s OBOR. The India-EU summit early September noted the same thing: \"India and the EU acknowledged the importance of connectivity in today\'s globalised world. They underlined that connectivity initiatives must be based on universally recognised international norms, good governance, rule of law, openness ...\" Again in September, PM Modi and his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe pledged to work for a more connected world. Their joint statement said, \"strong commitment to work together to enhance connectivity in India and with other countries in the Indo-Pacific region including Africa ... ensuring the development and use of connectivity infrastructure in an open, transparent and non-exclusive manner based on international standards and responsible debt financing practices, while ensuring respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, the rule of law, and the environment.\" They further reaffirmed the importance of \"quality infrastructure\" which, among others, ensures alignment with local economic and development strategies, safety, resilience, social and environmental impacts, and job creation as well as capacity building for the local communities. At the India-Afghanistan strategic partnership council meeting, the two sides \"stressed the need to make the regional Transit and Trade Agreement more inclusive and comprehensive ...\" The clearest iteration, of course, lay in the joint statement with Donald Trump in June, where both the countries said that they \"support bolstering regional economic connectivity through the transparent development of infrastructure and the use of responsible debt financing practices, while ensuring respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, the rule of law, and the environment.\" Equally importantly, India and Russia, which is now much closer to China, plumped for this new definition of connectivity — \"It should be based on dialogue and consent of all parties concerned with due respect to sovereignty. The Russian and Indian Sides being guided by the principles of transparency, sustainability and responsibility, reiterate their commitment to build effective infrastructure ... \" Get latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.',real

'The ousted mayor of Caracas pledged to spread his protest against Venezuela’s socialist government across the world as he arrived in Spain on Saturday, a day after escaping from house arrest and slipping past Venezuelan security forces into Colombia.Antonio Ledezma’s flight from Bogota landed at Barajas airport in Spain’s capital, Madrid. With a Venezuelan flag draped over his shoulder, he hugged his wife and two daughters and said he would fight Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro from exile“I am going to dedicate myself to traveling the world, to spread the hope of all Venezuelans to escape this regime, this dictatorship,” Ledezma said. “Venezuela isn’t on the verge of an abyss, it has fallen into the abyss.”Maduro, for his part, called Ledezma a ‘vampire flying around the world.’Ledezma started his global tour by meeting Saturday with Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy at the presidential palace hours after his arrival. Neither politician spoke publicly after the meeting. Ledezma has not said what other countries he plans to visit.Ledezma, 62, was removed as mayor of Caracas and detained in 2015 on charges of plotting to oust Maduro. He was one of the leaders of anti-government protests that rocked Venezuela in 2014 and led to the jailing of other prominent opponents.Besides his family, he was greeted in Madrid by the former president of Colombia, Andres Pastrana, and the former Venezuelan ambassador, Fernando Gerbasi.“Venezuela is completely collapsing. We can’t wait any longer,” Ledezma said. “We don’t have any resources left, only our morale.”Ledezma told The Associated Press on Friday that his decision to flee was driven by threats intended to force the opposition to resume negotiations with Maduro’s government. Fellow opposition leader and former cellmate Leopoldo Lopez remains under house arrest in Venezuela.After slipping past intelligence police officers stationed outside his residence 24 hours a day, he passed through several police checkpoints in a long journey by car to Colombia. Colombian immigration authorities said Ledezma entered the country legally across the Simon Bolivar Bridge.Ledezma, who thanked both Spanish and Colombian authorities for what he described as their warm welcomes, was elated after his escape.“I’ve lived out a James Bond movie,” he said. “I made this route of more than 24 hours, passing 29 control points, checkpoints, crossing paths, accepting all the risks, and in every moment I always thought about the value of freedom.”',real
'The Ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus said, “You cannot step into the same river twice.” He meant to warn us about constant change. Nothing can be taken for granted. The past is an imperfect guide to the future. This is the lesson the BJP has to keep in mind from now till June 2019. Until August 15, Narendra Modi seemed to be dominating politics totally. It seemed 2019 was in the bag with the only question being how much bigger would the BJP’s majority be. Since then, the clouds have darkened a bit. It began with the debacle of Ram Rahim and the failure of the Manohar Lal Khattar government in Haryana to protect its citizens. Yogi Adityanath has created as many controversies as he could within six months of becoming Chief Minister.But those states are not going to the polls this side of 2019. It is the journey from now to the general election (whenever Narendra Modi chooses to hold it) which has to be carefully watched. There are dangers along the way. Take the Gujarat elections to begin with. Given the impressive record Narendra Modi had established over his three victories, it would be difficult for the BJP to do better. The chief minister is almost anonymous; Amit Shah and Modi have taken over the campaign.Remember the Delhi election of 2015? Then the BJP relied totally on Modi’s face on posters delivering victory. It paid a heavy price. It is also interesting to see the agitation being stirred up about Padmavati. If there are still BJP leaders who think that delaying the date of release of the film has any relevance, they need to step into the 21st Century. You can already watch the songs online. If the film is delayed in release, someone would no doubt put a pirated copy online. The days of depriving people of access to information by government order are long gone. Of course, the purpose of the agitation is merely to inflame sections of voters. That is a double-edged sword; you cannot control whom it will hurt.Gujarat has also seen the relaunch of Rahul Gandhi as the leader who is ready to deliver success. Since he spoke in Berkeley, California, two months ago, Rahul Gandhi seems a different person. From then to the publication of an article in the Op-Ed page of the Financial Times on November 8 tells us he has come a long way. Rahul Gandhi appears to have acquired an able group of advisers who are helping him improve his image. His tweets have landed blows because he chooses to mock the Prime Minister as often as earlier he used to angrily denounce him.',real
'NEW DELHI: Viacom18, producers of Sanjay Leela Bhansali\'s period drama Padmavati, say they have voluntarily deferred the film\'s release date+ . The film was set to hit the screens on December 1. \"Viacom18 Motion Pictures, the studio behind \' Padmavati \', has voluntarily deferred the release date of the film from December 1st 2017,\" it said in a statement on Sunday. The company emphasised its \"respect and regard for the law of the land and all our institutions and statutory bodies including the Central Board of Film Certification.\" Read this story in Marathi A new release date will be announced once the \"requisite clearances\" are in place, the production house added. The period drama, starring Deepika Padukone, Ranveer Singh and Shahid Kapoor, has been facing massive agitation from various groups, including Shri Rajput Karni Sena, which alleged that the film distorts history and falsely portrays a relationship between Rajput queen Padmini and Muslim ruler Alauddin Khilji. Official Media Statement on @FilmPadmavati. https://t.co/dlq9TIpDow — Viacom18 (@viacom18) 1511087617000 Director Sanjay Leela Bhansali had sought to clear the air about the alleged romance between queen Padmini and Khilji, saying he was careful in depicting the \"Rajput honour and dignity\" in the film. The producers had also arranged a private screening of the movie and invited those concerned regarding the film\'s content, but the agitating Rajput outfits remained unappeased. Moreover, Censor Board chief Prasoon Joshi had slammed the makers for allowing the film to be screened before obtaining a certificate from the board. On Friday, the CBFC had sent the film back to the producer as the application for the certification was \"incomplete\". The Karni Sena had called for a countrywide \'bandh\' on December 1 to protest the release of Padmavati. The fringe outfit had also threatened Bhansali and Padukone with physical harm for defending the film. Amidst growing protest over the film, Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje had written to the Centre on Saturday, seeking \"necessary changes\" in the movie before its release, so that \"sentiments of any community are not hurt\".

'NEW DELHIi: Breaking his silence on the \'Padmavati\' row, CBFC chief and adman-lyricist Prasoon Joshi said on Saturday that it was a matter of concern that makers of the film were releasing it to the media even before it has been reviewed, approved and certified by the Censor Board. Joshi explained that the film has been sent back to its makers for leaving blank a crucial column in its application that requires them to state whether the work is based on fiction or draws from history - a point of contention between the producers and protestors claiming a distortion of the story of the Mewar queen. TOI had on Friday reported that the sticking point in \'Padmavati\'\'s application for certification was Part 7(a) of the form for films produced in India, which mandates that filmmakers \"specify whether the film is based on fiction or true incident or true story or mythology or epic or devotional or biographical and if so the source from which it has been made may be mentioned (sic).\" In an official statement issued on Saturday, Joshi clarified that the application form seeking certification for \'Padmavati\' had left this column blank, leading the board to return the incomplete form. \"Padmavati\'s application came up this week for review. Makers admit the paper work isn\'t complete. The disclaimer whether the film is a work of fiction or historical was left blank and on being asked to provide important documents, they targeted CBFC for \'looking the other way\'. It is surprising,\" Joshi said. Joshi also noted the tendency of filmmakers to bypass the censor board and share the film with media even before it was approved and certified by the board. He said, \"It is disappointing that \'Padmavati\' is being screened for media and getting reviewed on national channels without CBFC having seen or certified the film.\" He also said circumventing the CBFC, \"compromises the role of systems and balances that are part of a functioning industry; it\'s myopic to treat certification process haphazardly to suit convenience. On one hand, holding CBFC responsible and pressuring it to accelerate the process, and, on other, hand attempt to subvert the very process, sets an opportunistic precedent (sic).\" In Video: Padmavati: CBFC slams makers for holding private screenings Get latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.',real
'NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday dismissed a plea to ban public screening of Sanjay Leela Bhansali\'s \'Padmavati\', saying it is premature as the censor board is yet to take a call on the issue and the court could not usurp the functions of the statutory body. A bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud, which had earlier dismissed a similar petition, said it was premature to file petition against release of the film as Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) is yet to clear the movie. \"CBFC has a definite role and it will decide the issue as per the guidelines. It is their duty. How can the court intervene and stay screening of the film. The board has a statutory duty. Can the court injunct the statutory body from exercising its duty? You are crossing the statutory steps and coming directly to court. It is pre-mature,\" the bench said. The court passed the order on a PIL filed by advocate Manohar Lal Sharma alleging that the film hurt sentiments of people by distorting and twisting historical facts and portraying queen Padmavati in a bad light. He also told the bench that producers and director of the film should be prosecuted for defaming a historical personality. Senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for the producers, refuted the allegation and said there was no merit in the petition as the film was yet to cleared by the censor board.

'Padmavati is your most ambitious project so far in terms of scale. What does it mean to you?It’s wonderful not just for me, but for women in cinema in general, considering the kind of budget woman-centric films have had in India. I’m extremely proud of the fact that today I’m in a place where producers (Viacom 18 and Bhansali Productions) not just trust me but cast me in a movie that primarily revolves around the life of a woman character. I have acted in woman-centric movies earlier, too, such as Piku. None of them were like this in terms of scale.What did you find fascinating about the character of Padmavati?I look at it through two different lenses. As an actor, I am excited about her strength and courage. I have played strong women characters in some of my films and each one of them is identifiable — be it Naina from Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani (2013), Veronica in Cocktail (2012) or Mastani in Bajirao Mastani. All of them have a mind of their own. Same goes for Padmavati. Today’s generation can relate to her courage. For me, the fact that such a film is made and supported is very empowering. Its first poster featured me as Padmavati. I have not seen that in a long time.How much investment in terms of time and energy have you made?A lot. While we were shooting for Bajirao Mastani, one day Sanjay Leela Bhansali asked me: ‘What are you doing next year? Keep your dates aside as I’m thinking of doing a movie on Padmavati.’ So, this kind of started brewing some three years ago. A large part of the preparation for a film is a mental process. For me, it is not so much about going for diction classes or learning the dance moves — those are simpler. What’s important for me is that one is completely consumed by the character.What kind of challenges did it pose for you as an actor?It is weird that every time I talk about a movie, I feel that it is the most difficult role I have played. I have to say that again with Padmavati. I will work on my next (a movie produced by Vishal Bhardwaj on a gangster, Sapna Didi) in February. Everyone has been asking me why I am taking a long break before that. But I need that time off. Padmavati has taken so much from me — physically and emotionally — that I need time to rejuvenate and feel like myself again before I slip into another role.How affected were you by the controversies around the film during its making?We are extremely proud and confident of the film we have made. When the heart is in the right place, no one can stop a film. While working on the film, as artistes, we were in a different zone. I only spoke up last month after I finished the film and came out of that zone (she reacted to a group of protester in Surat damaging a rangoli inspired by Padmavati). That’s when I wondered for how long are we going to remain silent? For how long would the entertainment industry be made a scapegoat for everything that happens in this country? I believe we are constantly answerable to everyone for some reason or the other. Why attack cinema which is full of love and which brings people together? Why curb people’s freedom of expression? How long can we allow some people to get away with what they have been doing?When you know someone in a certain way, to turn that dynamic on its head is quite challenging. We didn’t meet during the shoot. We didn’t have any idea about what the other person was doing.This is your third film with Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Ranveer Singh. Ranveer and you played passionate lovers in the first two (Goliyon Ki Rasleela Ram-Leela, 2013, and, Bajirao Mastani). In Padmavati, you don’t even share the screen with him.It is very weird! Sanjay sir brought the two of us together for two love stories and then he decided to put us in some kind of hate story. We are almost like the beauty and the beast in Padmavati.You do a Chennai Express (2013) and then Finding Fanny (2014). How do you choose your projects?The choice is instinctive. But I wish to keep the excitement alive. I find it very thrilling to get into different characters every six months. Even while picking my scripts, I follow my instincts. I am not looking at churning out X number of movies, but I want to do quality work. If I don’t like something, I won’t take it up. That’s something I’m never going to change. So, sometimes, there could be four films of mine in a year or just one.This is your 10th year in the industry. How would you say the journey has been so far?I have got way more than I had ever imagined. I also know that it is a result of my commitment, hard work and dedication. It has not happened overnight. Only my family, my team and I know what kind of effort it has taken. At the same time, I’m not complaining. I love what I do.Which are the movies that became turning points in your career?Om Shanti Om (2007) definitely is one. Very few actresses would have had that kind of debut. Even today when I step out, people call me Shantipriya. After Om Shanti Om, there was Love Aaj Kal (2009) and Cocktail.Cocktail consolidated your position as an actor. But was that the outcome of the hard work you put in the preceding years?Hard work is constant and consistent. When people don’t like a film, it does not mean that hard work has not gone into it. Maybe we had not identified with what was being done. I have learnt on the job, evolved as a person and all that has made me the actor I am today.Did you struggle to fit into the industry?I would not say it was hard. However, I had created a certain pressure for myself. It was my own assumption that one has to look a certain way or conduct oneself in a certain manner until I realised that the best way is to be myself. That came after my on-the-field experience as well as through my share of ups and downs. I understood that there is a stereotype but I don’t have to make an effort to fit into that.Have your looks ever worked to your disadvantage?They can be a disadvantage. I have been told that I was not offered some projects because I’m good-looking. A director I have worked with a couple of times told me: ‘You are too good-looking for this part. It does not work for the story.’ I have never really understood what that means. (After a pause) I find that’s a director’s shortcoming. If the director knows that I have the ability to deliver, then he should also know that I would have the ability to transform myself physically to essay that character.You call yourself a shy and private person. How do you handle the public scrutiny of your life?That’s what I am. I understand the public interest in my life, but I find it hard to deal with. At the same time, I have chosen to be in a field where it is part of what I do. So, I have come to terms with it. I would like to believe that I handle it well now. I am still awkward in large gatherings. But, if I can’t make conversation, I don’t put any pressure on myself. Besides, I don’t want to announce on social media what my mood is like or what I’m having for breakfast.Earlier, you often spoke about your personal life, but now, you seem to be a lot more restrained about what you share…There is no formula to that either. There are some parts of my life I would like to keep to myself. The rest is in the public domain. I may choose not to talk about certain things, but I don’t hide anything either.What led you to speak about your depression?When I got better, something told me that I needed to share my experience. I am happy to see how the conversation around mental health has changed. We are acknowledging the condition and addressing it. Though the stigma attached to it still exists and we have a long way to go, people are actually observing Mental Health Day!Was it cathartic?I feel liberated today — I had caged it up within me for so many months. I could not understand what was happening to me. Since I am open about it, everyone knows what I have been through. Maybe a part of me felt responsible to help other people as there is a lack of awareness regarding it. Often, there is a conflict over what is going on in one’s mind. After I spoke up, at least some people jumped that phase. They can identify the symptoms. For me, recognising these symptoms was the hardest part. Getting over it was easier.When you take a break between projects, what do you generally do?I’m with my family. With them, it is more about doing things together like every other family. That keeps me grounded.When all of you get together, are there frequent badminton games?I have recently started playing badminton again. My racquets were rusting and the shuttles were getting musty. I play downstairs in my building in the evening.Both your sister Anisha (she is a golfer) and you went on to make unusual career choices. What prompted your choices?We made our own career choices because our parents gave us wings to fly. They did not burden us with their expectations. That’s what my grandparents did with my parents. My parents have given us a normal and disciplined childhood without much luxury, like any other middle-class family. My sister and I are different from each other. My parents could see that and encouraged it. I was inclined to the creative world. My sister, on other hand, is extremely calm and intelligent. She has become her own beautiful person today. A large part of my success is because my parents have been so supportive.You are often spotted hanging out with other film personalities. What’s your social life like?I am extremely grateful that I always had very supportive co-stars, directors and producers. The unfortunate fact about being an actor is that we are like nomads — we are constantly moving from one place to another. We build a life with a certain group of people when we work on a film, but just when we are emotionally getting comfortable, it is taken away from us. We move on to our next film and start the same process all over again. The good thing is that all of us are supportive of each other and we make the effort to stay in touch.Recently, some female actors have talked about the exploitation and harassment they faced or face in the industry. You were an outsider when you came in. Did you face any such problem?I can only speak from my experience. Being an outsider, I was always told that Bollywood is equal to a casting couch. I have been very fortunate not to have experienced it. I am made to feel extremely safe and comfortable. But, perhaps, that’s not the case with other people.I can see Willie Harcourt-Cooze’s Chocolate Bible in your living room. Are you a chocolate person?I am a baking person. I enjoy cooking, but I love baking more. I bake quite often. Over the years, I have picked up books during my travels that mean something to me. Right now, this book is a display piece. Hopefully, it will soon make its way into my kitchen.People’s ChoiceDeepika is undoubtedly an amazing actor and an equally gorgeous person. I have always found her to be grounded, warm and gracious. Her success itself is an inspiring story. She is simple and honest and approaches each role with great intelligence. — Honey Trehan, director of her next filmDeepika’s upbringing has given her a lot of discipline and the ability to work hard. She is obviously talented, but after Cocktail, she has been unstoppable. She has made brilliant choices by picking up different kinds of roles and by making them work for her. — Dinesh Vijan, producer-director',real
'MUMBAI: Beset with controversy for the past few weeks, Viacom18 Motion Pictures\' production \'Padmavati\', which was due for release on December 1, has been deferred \"voluntarily\", the producers said on Sunday. In a statement to PTI, a spokesperson of Viacom18 Motion Pictures said, \"Viacom18 Motion Pictures, the studio behind \'Padmavati\', has voluntarily deferred the release date of the film from December 1st 2017.\" Saying that the studio would soon announce the new release date for the film, the spokesman emphasised it has the highest regard for the law of the land and statutory bodies such as the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC). As a \"responsible and law-abiding corporate citizen\", it was committed to following the established procedure and convention, it said. \"We have faith that we will soon obtain the requisite clearances to release the film,\" the statement read. Censor Board chief Prasoon Joshi had on Saturday slammed the filmmakers for allowing the film to be screened for various media channels before obtaining a certificate from the board. The CBFC had sent the film back to the producer as the application for the certification was \"incomplete\". \"We are a responsible, law-abiding corporate citizen and have the highest respect and regard for the law of the land and all our institutions and statutory bodies, including the Central Board of Film Certification,\" a statement from the film production unit said. The producers reiterated: \"The film is an eloquent portrayal of a tale that will fill every Indian with pride and showcase our country\'s story-telling prowess across the globe.\" \'Padmavati\' has been facing controversy since its director, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, began shooting the film earlier this year. The first poster of the movie was released in October this year and triggered a storm with Rajput groups and others claiming that the director had \"distorted\" historical facts. Bhansali and lead actor Deepika Padukone have received threats. Meanwhile, the film fraternity has come out in support of Bhansali and the team, with many leading artistes calling it an attack on creative freedom. Filmmaker Anurag Basu said, \"The whole \'Padmavati\' row is based on just presumptions. Protesters have not seen a single frame of the film yet, but they know that history has been tampered. How? Karni Sena and other protesters will face huge existential crisis post the release of \"Padmavati\" so they are trying to juice out maximum.\" In Video: ‘Padmavati’ row: Makers voluntarily defer film’s release date Get latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.',real
'NEW DELHI: Even as BJP-ruled Madhya Pradesh today banned the film Padmavati+ , Punjab\'s Congress CM appeared to support his stance saying he believes the protests against the movie are valid. Separately, West Bengal chief minister and Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee also waded into the controversy, but she was against the protests, and called the whole situation a \"super emergency\" for the way it was being handled. \"The Padmavati controversy is not only unfortunate but also a calculated plan of a political party to destroy the freedom to express ourselves. We condemn this super emergency. All in the film industry must come together and protest in one voice,\" said Banerjee. Several sections of the Rajput community believe director Sanjay Leela Bhansali has distorted history in the film which happens to be about a fictional queen called Padmini. They believe, not having seen the film, that he has disrespected this fictional queen. Meanwhile, the Punjab CM Amarinder Singh supported the protests saying, \"distortions of history\" won\'t be accepted. \"Nobody will accept distortion of history and those who are protesting are rightly doing so,\" said Punjab CM Amarinder Singh. Interestingly, Amarinder\'s party colleague Shashi Tharoor was initially critical of the protests and had made some disparaging comments about former maharajas and how acquiescent they may have been toward the British. That promoted the BJP\'s Smriti Irani to comment on erstwhile maharajas in the Congress party, one of whom is Amarinder. \"Did every maharaja surrender before the British? What will Jyotiraditya Scindia, Digvijay Singh and Amarinder Singh have to say about Shashi Tharoor\'s comment?\" Irani tweeted. Now, Amarinder has made clear where he stands on the controversy. As for Tharoor, following backlash from certain sections of society, he did an about-face. The Congress leader defended his remarks+ , saying he didn\'t mean to disparage the Rajput community as a whole. \"I am dismayed that some BJP supporters are claiming I attacked Rajput honour... I spoke about the Maharajahs who made their accommodations with the British. I have never made a communal comment in my life,\" Tharoor said in a tweet. Then, without directly referring to the furore over Padmavati, Tharoor said the ruling BJP should address the concerns of the Rajputs and respect their sentiments. \"As for specific concerns of the Rajput community, people\'s sentiments must be respected in the interests of India\'s diversity and harmony. Rajput valour is part of our history and is not in question. BJP and its censors should take these concerns into account,\" he said in a second tweet.

'Breaking her silence on the Padmavati row, Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje has written a letter to Union Minister of Information and Broadcasting Smriti Irani, urging that the movie not be released without “necessary changes”. She said a committee with “famous historians, film personalities and members of the aggrieved community” should be constituted to discuss the movie’s story in detail.In a statement released on Saturday, Raje’s office said that she wrote a letter to Irani “urging her that the movie should not be released till necessary changes are made so that sentiments of any community are not hurt”. The movie is scheduled for release on December 1.Raje also asked the Censor board to think of all the outcomes before certifying the movie, and said that once a committee such as the one she suggested had discussed the film in detail, “appropriate changes” could be made. In Indore, Union minister Thawar Chand Gehlot asked the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) to cut “objectionable” scenes in Padmavati. “Anger is palpable in the country over this movie. History is distorted to enact filmy scenes, which should be taken seriously by the Censor board,” PTI quoted him as saying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\tif(typeof(jQuery)==\"function\"){(function($){$.fn.fitVids=function(){}})(jQuery)};\r\n\t\t\t\tjwplayer(\'jwplayer_moY08gOm_xe0BVfqu_div\').setup(\r\n\t\t\t\t{\"playlist\":\"http:\\/\\/vidshare.indianexpress.com\\/jw6\\/moY08gOm.xml\"}\r\n\t\t\t);\r\n\t\t\r\nIn her letter to Irani, Raje said that while filmmakers had the right to make movies as per their understanding, “the Constitution also provides that fundamental rights be controlled, on the basis of reason, in case of law and order (situation), morality, and when sentiments of citizens are hurt”. Hence, there should be a “rethink” on the movie’s release, she said.As news broke of the letter written by Raje to Irani, a “Mewar delegation” met the CM and expressed their “gratitude”. It included Cabinet minister Shrichand Kriplani, BJP MLA from Chittorgarh Chandrabhan Singh, Mewar Kshatriya Mahasabha president Balu Singh, Jauhar Smriti Sansthan’s general secretary Bhanwar Singh, and its treasurer Narpat Singh, among others.READ ALSO: CBFC chairman Prasoon Joshi expresses disappointment over private screening of PadmavatiTwo days ago, the Uttar Pradesh government had asked the I&B Ministry to get the release deferred in the state because “public anger” over the “script” and “distorted historical facts” in it could lead to an “adverse effect” on the law-and-order situation.Meanwhile, protests over the film, directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali, continued in Rajasthan, with a group temporarily blocking entry to the Kumbhalgarh Fort in Rajsamand district demanding a ban, a day after a similar, day-long protest at Chittorgarh Fort.

'NEW DELHI: Stepping up probe into the Panama Papers+ , the income tax department has slapped criminal charges under the new anti-black money Act and launched fresh assessment of stashed offshore income against over half-a-dozen Indian entities in the list, official sources said. They said the department has detected undisclosed assets and stashed funds located in foreign countries in case of seven individuals and entities named in the leaks and the taxman has begun investigations against them under the Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) and Imposition of Tax Act, 2015. Sources privy to the probe said the tax department has ordered fresh assessment and also re-assessment of the income of these entities and will soon launch criminal prosecution against all of them as the entities had allegedly not disclosed offshore properties to Indian tax and banking authorities in the past. These are the first set of cases of undisclosed foreign assets which are being probed under the new anti-black money Act, that has criminal sections for prosecution under the law. Under the new anti-black money law, cases of overseas illegal assets, which till recently were probed under the regular and civil Income Tax Act of 1961, attract a steep 120 per cent tax and penalty on undisclosed foreign assets and income besides carrying a jail term of up to 10 years. Prosecution of these seven entities under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) would also be initiated in the coming days, as the anti-black money Act of 2015 qualifies to be a predicate offence for money laundering investigations, they said. The sources refused to divulge the identities of the seven entities citing the overriding global tax information exchange secrecy clauses between various countries. The Central Board of Direct Taxes has recently said that investigations in the Panama Papers leak cases till now have resulted in the I-T department detecting undisclosed wealth of Rs 792 crore so far and the probe in these cases is on in \"full swing\". Over a year after the Washington-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) made the documents public, the CBDT said it has found 147 of the total 426 cases \"actionable\". The department also conducted searches in 35 cases and surveys in 11, the CBDT had said. \"The Income Tax Department conducted enquiries in all 426 cases, inter alia, through making 395 references to 28 foreign jurisdictions. \"Based on analysis of the information obtained and investigation conducted, the outcome so far indicates 147 actionable cases and 279 non-actionable cases (non-residents/ or no irregularities),\" it said in the first week of this month. The CBDT said the Panama Papers contained brief particulars of about 426 persons, prima facie, Indians or persons of Indian origin. The government had constituted a multi-agency group (MAG) of investigative agencies in April last year to probe these instances. The MAG has so far submitted seven reports to the government.

'Book: The Whole Shebang: Sticky Bits of Being a Woman\r\nAuthor: Lalita Iyer\r\nPublication: Bloomsbury India\r\nPages: 168 \r\nPrice: Rs 350The sub title of the book reads Sticky Bits of Being a Woman. Indeed, Lalita Iyer has not spared any of the sticky bits, and some more, in this anthology of essays written in a chatty, breezy style. Part memoir, part self help and all funny, it’s something that most women will relate to. Iyer’s book was born out of the columns that she wrote for a various publications and magazines. The book begins with Iyer sharing all the troubles she had to face to find the right underwear. With brutal honesty she talks about navigating thongs and how she wishes grandma underwear to be back in vogue. With similar poignancy sex, career, fashion, body image, motherhood and love are discussed. Financial independence has a whole chapter.Iyer resorts to personal experiences, comparing and contrasting them to comment on the society at large — and that is what lifts this book up from others in the genre. She talks about her childhood, growing up in Mumbai in a south Indian household; and her experiments with dating, men, various jobs and even her hair — which has transitioned from thick curls to a pixie cut now: liberal reminders of that one friend we all have had.The book has a generous dose of pop culture: Tinder, Facebook, Manolo Blahniks make appearences. References to kitchen ingredients, your wardrobe and even your bathroom are used to define relationships. While talking of men, Iyer writes, “Every man wants to be a conditioner, but whether they like it or not, quite a few men have to do the dirty work of a shampoo.”There is some philosophy as well. About love, the malady that has ailed one and all, she says, “Maybe love is one of those vestigial organs, like the appendix, or the male nipple, that evolution is teaching us to live without.”',real
'MANILA: Donald Trump shook hands today with a smiling Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, a man who boasts about personally killing people and who is waging a drug war that rights groups say involves mass murder. The US leader is in Manila with leaders of 18 other nations for two days of summits, the final leg of a headline- grabbing Asian tour dominated by the North Korean nuclear crisis. Allegations of Russian meddling in last year\'s US presidential elections have also hounded the second half of his 12-day trip, which took him from Japan to South Korea, China and Vietnam. Rights groups have called on Trump to end his Asian journey with a strong statement against Duterte\'s drugs war, which has seen police and suspected vigilantes kill thousands of people. But brief encounters between them in the lead-up to official talks scheduled for late this morning appeared to support Duterte\'s confidence that Trump was not concerned with the killings. Trump shook hands with Duterte, then the pair chatted for about 30 seconds as the Philippine leader smiled broadly, before the opening ceremony for the first summit this morning. Trump had his back to the cameras. The pair also sat next to each other at a pre-summit banquet yesterday, during which they smiled, chatted and clinked champagne glasses. Duterte, 72, sang a Filipino love song in front of his audience at the banquet, saying in a light-hearted fashion that he did so on the orders of the US president. \"I\'m sure he will not take it up,\" Duterte said yesterday when asked whether he expected Trump to raise the issue of alleged extra-judicial killings in the drugs war. Duterte won elections last year after promising to eradicate illegal drugs with an unprecedented campaign that would see up to 100,000 people killed. Since he took office, police have reported killing 3,967 people in the crackdown. Another 2,290 people have been murdered in drug-related crimes, while thousands of other deaths remain unsolved, according to government data. Many Filipinos back Duterte, believing he is taking necessary measures to fight crime, but rights groups warn he may be orchestrating a crime against humanity. Amnesty International accuses police of shooting dead defenceless people and paying assassins to murder addicts. When pressured over allegations of extra-judicial killings carried out by police, Duterte insists he has never told them to break the law. But rights groups say police are following Duterte\'s incitements to kill, including comments made last year when he said he would be \"happy to slaughter\" three million addicts. He has also repeatedly boasted about killing people himself, most recently on Thursday while in Vietnam for the Asia-Pacific economic summit. \"At the age of 16, I already killed someone. A real person, a rumble, a stabbing. I was just 16 years old. It was just over a look,\" Duterte said. Former US president Barack Obama was one of many prominent critics of Duterte\'s handling of the drugs war. The Philippine leader responded last year by calling Obama a \"son of a whore\". But Trump has appeared to be a fan of Duterte, telling him in a telephone call in April that he was doing a \"great job\". Duterte said yesterday that Trump had offered him further \"words of encouragement\" during a brief chat in Vietnam the previous day on the sidelines of another regional summit. Duterte is hosting the world leaders because the Philippines holds the rotating chair of the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) bloc. The events today and tomorrow in Manila are two separate ASEAN-hosted summits, which also include China, Japan, Russia, South Korea, India, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The rising threat of the Islamic State group across Southeast Asia, and further efforts to pressure North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un to abandon his nuclear ambitions, were top agenda items in Manila. \"Terrorism and violent extremism endanger the peace, stability and security of our region because these threats know no boundaries,\" Duterte said in an opening ceremony speech today.

'NEW DELHI: The President and the Vice-President continue to get less salaries as compared to the top bureaucrats and service chiefs since the laws are yet to be amended to rectify an anomaly with the implementation of the 7th Pay Commission\'s recommendations nearly two years ago. The proposal for enhancement of the salaries of the President, the Vice-President and the Governors was prepared by the Union Home Ministry and forwarded to the Cabinet Secretariat more than a year ago for the approval of the Union Cabinet, a home ministry official said. However, no decision has been taken on it yet, the official told PTI on condition of anonymity. At present, the President gets Rs 1.50 lakh per month, the Vice-President Rs 1.25 lakh and a Governor of a state Rs 1.10 lakh. After the implementation of the 7th Pay Commission\'s awards on January 1, 2016, the Cabinet Secretary, who is the top-most bureaucrat in the country, gets Rs 2.5 lakh per month and a Secretary in the Union government draws Rs 2.25 lakh per month. The President is also the supreme commander of all the three armed forces - the Indian Army, the Indian Air Force, and the Indian Navy. However, the President\'s current salary is less than the chiefs of the three armed forces, who draw salary equivalent to the cabinet secretary. No response was received for the text messages sent to the spokesperson of the government, asking the reason for the delay in getting the nod of the Union Cabinet to the home ministry\'s proposal. When the Union Cabinet gives its nod to the ministry\'s proposal, bills to this effect will be tabled in the Parliament for passage, the official said. According to the proposal, salary of the President may go up to Rs 5 lakh, the Vice-President\'s salary will increase to Rs. 3.5 lakh and a Governor\'s to Rs 3 lakh per month. Salaries of the President, Vice-President and Governors were last hiked in 2008 when the Parliament had approved a three-fold increase. Till 2008, the President\'s salary was Rs 50,000, the Vice-President\'s Rs 40,000 and a Governor\'s Rs 36,000 per month. In addition, proposals are also expected to be moved for raising the pensions of former Presidents, spouses of deceased Presidents, former Vice-Presidents, spouses of deceased Vice-Presidents and former Governors.

While Jammu and Kashmir police on Sunday refuted suggestions of IS influence on Kashmir militancy, there\'s no gainsaying the impact of Zakir Musa, appointed commander of the terrorist group Hizbul Mujahideen following the killing of Burhan Wani at the hands of security forces in 2016. Musa, after taking over, had threatened to behead Hurriyat separatists for calling Kashmir conflict a political one, describing it instead as a religious war to establish Islamic rule. In July 2017, the Global Islamic Media Front claimed Musa had been named the head of Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind, a newly created cell of al-Qaeda for Kashmir. IG Kashmir, Munir Khan, equivocated, \"We are in the process of investigations as to what is the quantum of the influence of ISIS on Kashmir militancy.\" He was responding to questions about the pro-IS slogans at Mugees\'s funeral. Mugees was believed to be a top commander of Al-Qaeda-linked Ansar Gazwat-ul-Hind led by Zakir Musa. However, Tehreek-ul-Mujahideen (TeM), a local militant outfit, claimed Mugees was its district commander in Pulwama. One police sub-inspector Inam Tak too was killed while a SPO was injured in the shoot-out at Zukura. Director general of police S P Vaid, who refuted claims of IS being behind the Zukura attack, said, \"It\'s yet to be verified. I don\'t think IS has any presence here.\" People attended the funeral in large numbers despite police restrictions; however, they dispersed peacefully later. The family kept Mugees\'s body at the home for the night. He was buried in the ancestral grave, eyewitnesses said.

'MANILA, Philippines: A day after being criticized by President Donald Trump, a former CIA director questioned whether Russian President Vladimir Putin was manipulating Trump with flattery during the president\'s lengthy trip to Asia. Trump\'s trip was meant to be centered on trade and North Korea, and on Monday, he will talk with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who has overseen a bloody drug war that has featured extrajudicial killings. But Trump remains dogged by things he has said, and not said, about Russia. He tried to have it both ways Sunday on the issue of Russian interference in last year\'s presidential race, saying he believes both the US intelligence agencies when they say Russia meddled and Putin\'s sincerity in claiming that his country did not. \"I believe that he feels that he and Russia did not meddle in the election,\'\' Trump said in Hanoi, Vietnam. \"As to whether I believe it, I\'m with our agencies,\'\' Trump said. \"As currently led by fine people, I believe very much in our intelligence agencies.\'\' But just a day earlier, he had lashed out at the former heads of the US intelligence agencies, dismissing them as \"political hacks\'\' and claiming there were plenty of reasons to be suspicious of their findings that Russia meddled to help Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton. Former CIA director John Brennan, appearing Sunday on CNN\'s \"State of the Union\'\' with former national intelligence director James Clapper, said Trump was deriding them in an attempt to \"delegitimize\'\' the intelligence community\'s assessment. \"I think Mr. Putin is very clever in terms of playing to Mr. Trump\'s interest in being flattered. And also I think Mr. Trump is, for whatever reason, either intimidated by Mr. Putin, afraid of what he could do or what might come out as a result of these investigations,\'\' Brennan said. Clapper called the threat from Russia \"manifest and obvious.\'\' \"To try to paint it in any other way is, I think, astounding and, in fact, poses a peril to this country,\'\' he said on CNN. Brennan said Trump\'s ambiguity on Russia\'s involvement was \"very, very worrisome from a national security standpoint.\'\' \"I think he\'s giving Putin a pass and I think it demonstrates to Putin that Donald Trump can be played by foreign leaders who are going to appeal to his ego and play upon his securities,\'\' Brennan said. Questions about whether Trump believes the assessment about Russian election-meddling have trailed him since January, when he said for the first time, shortly before taking office, that he accepted that Russia was behind the election-year hacking of Democrats that roiled the White House race. A special counsel\'s examination of potential collusion between Moscow and Trump campaign aides so far has led to indictments against Trump\'s former campaign chairman and another top aide for crimes unrelated to the campaign, and a guilty plea from a Trump foreign policy adviser for lying to the FBI. Multiple congressional committees are also investigating. Trump told reporters traveling with him to Hanoi on Saturday that Putin had again vehemently denied the allegations. The two spoke during an economic conference in Danang, Vietnam. Trump danced around questions about whether he believed Putin but stressed Putin\'s denials. \"Every time he sees me, he says: `I didn\'t do that.\' And I believe _ I really believe _ that when he tells me that, he means it,\'\' Trump said, arguing that it makes no sense for him to belabor the issue when Russia could help the US on North Korea, Syria and other issues. In Hanoi on Sunday, Trump also pointed to sanctions the US has imposed on Russia as punishment for election meddling. \"They were sanctioned at a very high level, and that took place very recently,\'\' he said. \"It\'s now time to get back to healing a world that is shattered and broken.\'\' Trump was originally slated to depart Manila for Washington on Monday. He added a day to the schedule amid criticism that he would have missed the final summit. In addition to meeting with Duterte, Trump is expected to attend the Association for Southeast Asian Nations conference on Monday to urge allies to pressure North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons program. And he is expected, in meetings with other leaders, to push his agenda for bilateral, rather than multinational, trade agreements.

'NEW DELHI: The Congress allegations of \"a scam\" in the Narendra Modi government\'s deal to purchase 36 Rafale fighter aircraft is being seen as a plot to counter the BJP government\'s attempts to revive the Bofors ghost and initiate a probe into the AgustaWestland helicopter deal. The \'defence scams\' were tapped in the past by political rivals to push many seemingly strong central governments to tight spots. If defence minister-turned-rebel VP Singh led Opposition attacks on the Bofors deal to cripple the Rajiv Gandhi regime, the Congress raked up \"the Tehelka expose\" to force resignations of then defence minister George Fernandes and then BJP president Bangaru Laxman, putting the Atal Bihari Vajpayee regime in a spot. Sources said Congress will intensify its Rafale campaign in Parliament, Gujarat elections and across the states and will eventually allege \"kickbacks\" and Parliamentary committee probe into the aircraft deal. Incidentally, BJP members in a Parliamentary sub-committee have been seeking a re-look at the Bofors deal, seen part of the Centre\'s plot to revive the issue that haunted Congress in the past. Congress leaders are also in touch with some \"like-minded Opposition parties\" to make the Rafale deal their joint plank against \"corruption\" and \"compromise of national interests\". Despite the defence minister rubbishing the Congress charge, the latter insists the ruling establishment has failed to answer three questions: First, whether the Modi government agreed to purchase the Rafale aircraft at a price higher than what UPA regime had negotiated. Second, did PM take CCS permission before announcing purchase in Paris? And, third, Why PM bypassed experienced HAL? By alleging the PM had \"unilaterally\" decided on the deal by \"bypassing\" the Cabinet committees by \"doing away\" technolog y-transfer clause, Congress is clearly targeting Modi himself. It is also questioning the professional credentials of the Indian company chosen to manufacture the aircraft, making the larger plots clear at a time both the government and Opposition are readying for the coming electoral battles.

'CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh has welcomed the proposed elevation of Rahul Gandhi as Congress president, describing it as a step in the right direction to revive the party\'s fortunes ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Amarinder said the party elections announced on Monday and Rahul\'s elevation were long overdue. \"It was time to pass on the baton of the party affairs into the able hands of Rahul, who was mature and competent enough to lead the Congress into the next parliamentary elections,\" he said. Responding to a question, Captain Amarinder said he was completely in favour of promoting youth, in whose hands lay the future of the party and the country. Pointing out that the Congress in Punjab had fielded the maximum number of youth in the last Assembly polls; the chief minister said it was in the national interest to infuse young blood into the polity. Captain Amarinder pointed out that he had always been in favour of Rahul taking over the party\'s reins in order to inject the much-needed dynamism into it. Rahul had all the qualifications needed to provide strong and visionary leadership to the Congress, he added.

'NEW DELHI: The Congress Working Committee (CWC) today announced that election for the post of president will be held December 16 with the counting of votes scheduled for December 19. News agency ANI incorrectly reported earlier that the CWC passed a resolution to make Rahul Gandhi party president.+ The party said that notification for the post of Congress president will be issued on December 1, while nominations will have to be filed on December 4. In case there is no candidate aside from Rahul , the Congress will announce his candidature on the last date of scrutiny, which is December 5. Rahul, currently party vice president, is expected to be the only candidate in the fray. These announcements were made after a crucial meeting of the Congress Working Committee chaired by party president Sonia Gandhi at her 10, Janpath, residence in the Capital. The party\'s organisational election must be completed before December 31. The Election Commission has given the party the last extension for completing the internal poll process by the end of this year.

'NEW DELHI: Congress set the ball rolling on Monday for a generational change in the party by announcing the election schedule for the post of party president, which is set to be occupied by Rahul Gandhi in the midst of the Gujarat campaign. The schedule, approved by the Congress Working Committee, fixed the date of nomination and scrutiny of candidature for December first week. If Rahul is the only aspirant to file nomination, he is likely to be declared elected on December 5. This would mean Rahul would go into the Gujarat first phase of voting on December 9 as Congress chief, a politically significant development. Rahul is spearheading the party campaign in a bid to unseat BJP in Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s home state and his elevation further frames the tough contest as a \"Modi vs Rahul\" face-off. Interestingly, the election schedule announced by AICC in-charge of organisational elections Mullapally Ramachandran does not appear influenced by the Gujarat results. The process is to start with notification on December 1 and nominations can be filed till December 4. The papers will be scrutinised on December 5 while the last date of withdrawal is December 11. Voting is to be held on December 16 and results declared on December 19, though they may well be out much before. Though Rahul\'s elevation has been both a fait accompli and subject of feverish speculation for around two years, the election of a new Congress president is a milestone in the life of the principal opposition party. Sonia has been helming the party since 1998, a record stint at the top, beating family and Congress mascots like Indira Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru. Rahul will be the fifth member of the clan to hold the reins of Congress. For long seen as a \"reluctant politician\" — a reason why the Congress had to seek extension of internal elections for two successive years —Rahul finally stepping up to the plate will mark a makeover amid a tussle between the party\'s \"old guard\" and \"Gen-Next\". But the Gandhi scion has come a long way from the time when his rise was viewed as curtains for experienced party leaders. Possibly at its nadir in terms of popularity and strength since the 2014 defeat, Congress\'s change of guard comes at a tricky time for Rahul given that his elevation will coincide with polls in Gujarat and Himachal. A good outcome in the Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat polls will provide a leg up for the leader while big defeats would further depress the party mood, especially when the ruling saffron camp and the opposition parties have begun to prepare for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The discussion at the CWC meeting touched upon the Gujarat challenge. Saying that Rahul and other leaders were working hard for a \"positive result\" in the state, Sonia said, \"Let us do our best to prove that people are not fooled and that they will make the right decision and defeat the present dispensation there.\" Rahul sounded positive on Gujarat and advised that the party keep its focus on the \"development\" plank and not allow BJP to change the discourse. He sought single-minded focus, like the \"machhli ki aankh\", a reference to Arjun in the Mahabharat.

'NEW DELHI: The elevation of Rahul Gandhi as Congress president is finally on the cards after several missed deadlines, with the Congress Working Committee expected to approve on Monday an election schedule that will culminate in a generational change by the first week of December. Sources said the leadership renewed its plans to convene a meeting of its apex decision-making body earlier this week and finalised it on Saturday. While the agenda of the meeting has not been formally revealed, insiders said the party has no bigger subject on its mind than completing the organisational elections. As per the party constitution, the CWC meeting is required to approve the schedule for the election of the party president, the final step of the ongoing internal polls. As it is unlikely that there will be a contender to challenge Rahul, his election will be complete even as the Gujarat election peaks. Rahul\'s taking charge will bring the curtain down on mother Sonia\'s 19-year stint as party chief and end a long apprenticeship that saw Rahul being named vice-president in January 2013. There has been a mounting insistence in the Congress that he end lingering uncertainty and speculation and grasp the responsibility that will make him the fifth Nehru-Gandhi to head the party. His elevation in early December will mean that he heads into the final phase of the politically crucial Gujarat elections as AICC chief. Though he is anyway spearheading the party campaign in Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s home state, the symbolic significance of being in charge of the organisation is expected to buoy the party on the ground. Read this story in Gujarati The election, seen as a \'Modi vs Rahul\' clash, also sets the stage for Rahul becoming the Congress\'s prime ministerial candidate for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Though Sonia will step down as party chief, she is not expected to withdraw from politics altogether with some sections in the Congress seeing her playing a role in negotiations and coordination with non-NDA parties. Rahul\'s rise will also settle the wearying speculation about when the generational shift in the Congress hierarchy will come about. While he is unlikely to sideline party seniors- though there is unease among the veterans over what the transition will mean for them- younger leaders associated with him are likely to gain prominence. Blog: Why Rahul Gandhi should be elevated as Congress President before Gujarat polls There has been considerable confusion about the timing of Rahul\'s elevation since the party\'s internal polls reached the final phase last month. While his being named the president appeared imminent some time back, his tight poll campaign schedule and lack of word on the CWC meeting led to talk that this may happen after the Gujarat polls. Interestingly, earlier this month Rahul was asked about his elevation by party managers at a meeting called to discuss nationwide protests against demonetisation and GST planned for the anniversary of note ban on November 8. On that day, he had cryptically responded that it would \"happen soon\" without specifying the timing. The lack of clarity led to Congress leaders refusing to talk definitively about the subject, after top office-bearers last month ventured to predict that it would happen soon after Diwali. The issue of Rahul replacing Sonia as the head of Congress gained momentum over last couple of months and was seen as a done deal after he said as much in an interaction at the University of California in September.

'The Railways will soon send a detailed report to the UNESCO World Heritage Centre on the damage done to the Darjeeling Himalayan Railways (DHR), popularly known as the toy train service, during the recent Gorkhaland agitation.Two stations of DHR — a world heritage site — were burnt and ransacked during the 104-day long agitation in the Hills. Other stations were also partially damaged. The report will contain information about all stations, tracks and personnel.UNESCO has already expressed concern over incidents of arson having affecting the DHR and had even written to the Centre.Built between 1879 and 1881, the DHR is a 2-feet narrow-gauge railway which runs between New Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling (87 km). India’s highest railway station in Ghum, is part of this network. The rail line has a total of six zig zags and five loops and its highest point is at 2,200 m (7,218 ft), in Darjeeling. A major tourist attraction, the DHR got its heritage tag from UNESCO in 1999.A UNESCO team, which was forced to return from Darjeeling as the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) led agitation started, will be revisiting Darjeeling shortly.“We have asked for a detailed report from DHR regarding the damages and present condition. The report will be sent to the UNESCO World Heritage Centre through the union cultural ministry,” said Subrata Nath, executive director heritage (Railway Board), speaking to The Indian Express from New Delhi.“I do not think the world heritage tag is in danger. But we will seek the help of UNESCO during the repair and restoration process. Funds will be allotted for that purpose,” he added.\r\nIn January this year, then Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu had signed an agreement to enable UNESCO to develop a Comprehensive Conservation Management Plan (CCMP) for the DHR and a framework for an effective management system.The strike in the Darjeeling Hills, called by the GJM for a separate state of Gorkhaland, had started on June 15.“The UNESCO team, who were there making the conservation plan, had to abandon it and return during the agitation. They are on their way back,” said Nath.On July 8, supporters of Gorkhaland had set fire to Sonada station. On July 13, Gayabari station was torched allegedly by GJM supporters. However, GJM has maintained that it was the work of “miscreants to defame the party”. Both stations were badly damaged.',real
'Light rain early on Saturday morning brought Delhi’s air quality to ‘poor’ — an improvement from the ‘very poor’ and ‘severe’ levels that the city witnessed last week. This is the first time since October 16 that ‘poor’ air quality was recorded in the city. According to officials at the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the Safdarjung observatory saw 1 mm of rain between 2 am and 4 am on Saturday. Data from the Delhi Pollution Control Committee station at Mandir Marg, which is closest to the observatory, shows that PM (particulate matter) 2.5 levels shot up to 249 µg/m3 at 3 am and came down to 172 µg/m3 at 4 am. Around 4 pm, the concentration was down to 105 µg/m3.Air quality is usually better in the afternoon as compared to the night as temperature and wind speed during the day are higher. The acceptable limit of PM 2.5 is 60 µg/m3. Over the past week, the Delhi Fire Services and the municipal corporations have tried to reduce the concentration of pollutants in the air by spraying water from a height to mimic rain. At ITO, the move did not have too much of an impact.According to data by the Central Pollution Control Board, while PM 2.5 was around 110 µg/m3 before sprinkling 70,000 litres of water, it came down to 106 at 4 pm. It was recorded at 129 µg/m3 at 5 pm, and shot up above 200 µg/m3 at 11 pm, showing almost negligible gains. According to IMD officials, natural rain is spread over a much larger area and has a longer-lasting effect. But Saturday’s rain was so light that the impact started to wane by night.',real
'Beginning this week, visitors to Raj Bhavan, the residence of the Maharashtra Governor in Malabar Hill, have been able to roam around its famed walking trail in a solar, battery-operated car. The Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation acquired a small vehicle after Governor Ch. Vidyasagar Rao decided that visitors should have the option of an additional mode of transport.“The Governor introduced solar-powered vehicles in Tamil Nadu when he was holding charge there. He decided to introduce them here as well,” says Umesh Kashikar, the Governor’s spokesperson. Earlier this week, the first batch of visitors was able to experience Raj Bhavan’s ecology seated in the 15-seater car.“Earlier, whenever we received old visitors who were not able to walk through the whole trail, we would take them around in our own battery operated car. But that one is very small and can only seat four people,” said Kashikar, adding that with the new car, elderly visitors are able to take in all the sights. The two-and-a-half-kilometre trail begins at the 150-foot tall tricolour and a lawn where the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru unveiled the map of Maharashtra in 1950. The car then makes its way past a narrow road with sloping hills on one side and the sea on another, as signs reminding drivers that the speed limit is 20 kilometres per hour flash by. Pointing to another sign, Kashikar says, “Nowhere else will you read a road sign that says ‘drive slowly and be careful of peacocks’.”The vehicle stops at a specially designed peacock enclosure called Mayur Vihar. “It is very hard to spot peacocks here unless you arrive early morning. They do not stay in the enclosure and move about,” says Kashikar. The car’s rectangular dimensions prevent it from moving forward on to the final stretch that opens into Raj Bhavan’s rear entrance. “The car can go ahead, but it won’t be able to turn back,” explains Kashikar. Instead, the vehicle takes visitors to the final stops on the trail, an elevated deck called the Sunrise Point that offers panoramic views.“We lay mats here for early morning visitors who want to practise yoga,” he says.',real
'BEIJING: China on Monday strongly objected to President Ram Nath Kovind\'s visit to Arunachal Pradesh, saying India should refrain from \"complicating\" the border dispute when bilateral relations are at a \"crucial moment\". President Kovind visited Arunachal+ Pradesh yesterday. \"The Chinese government never acknowledged the so-called Arunachal Pradesh and our position on the border issue is consistent and clear,\" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang told the media when asked about Kovind\'s visit to Arunachal Pradesh, which China claims as Southern Tibet. China routinely objects to any senior Indian officials\' visit to the area. India has dismissed Beijing\'s objections, maintaining that Arunachal Pradesh is an integral part of the country and Indian leaders are as much free to visit the state as they are to any other part of the country. Both countries are \"in the process of settling this issue through negotiation and consultation and seek to reach to a fair and reasonable solution acceptable to all\", Lu said. Pending final settlement all parties should work for peace and tranquillity, he said. \"China firmly opposes the Indian leader\'s relevant activities in the relevant region when China-India relations are at a crucial moment,\" he said. \"We hope India could work in the same direction and maintain general picture of bilateral ties and refrain from complicating border issue and work to create favourable conditions for border negotiations and for the sound and stable development of bilateral ties,\" he said. The Line of Actual Control (LAC) between India and China stretches to 3,488 kms. On November 6, China had raised objection to defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman\'s visit+ to the border areas of Arunachal Pradesh. Both sides held 19 round of talks by the Special Representatives to resolve the boundary dispute. The 20th round is expected to be held next month in New Delhi, though dates have not yet been announced.

'SEOUL: A rare 5.4-magnitude earthquake hit South Korea\'s southeast today, the second most powerful quake on record in a country that seldom experiences significant tremors. The quake, felt across much of the country including in the capital Seoul, struck at the shallow depth of nine kilometres (six miles) near the industrial city of Pohang at around 2:30 pm (0530 GMT), the Korea Meteorological Administration said. Seven people were injured, Seoul\'s public administration ministry said, but they warned that number could rise because the quake was shallow. The Korean peninsula rarely has to worry about significant quakes. But seismic activity is closely monitored because a spike in activity is often the first indication that North Korea has carried out a nuclear test. The port city of Pohang is home to the headquarters of Posco — the country\'s top, and the world\'s fourth largest, steelmaker. No immediate damage was reported in the firm\'s steel mills. Photos and video footage sent to local TV stations showed crumbled street walls, furniture violently shaking inside people\'s homes and people rushing out of buildings in panic. Shattered storefronts and goods tumbling off store shelves were seen in images posted on social media, as well as cars smashed by fallen bricks and cracks in the ground. Emergency centres nationwide were flooded with thousands of calls seeking information, while Kakao Talk — the South\'s top mobile messenger application — reported service disruption due to heavy traffic. South Korean President Moon Jae-In, on his way to Seoul after attending the ASEAN summit in Manila, is set to hold an emergency meeting upon arrival, his office said. Today\'s quake was followed by multiple aftershocks including a 4.3-magnitude tremor that hit about two hours later. It came a day ahead of the all-important college entrance exam during which the whole nation falls silent to help teenagers focus on the annual event, whose result could define their future in the competitive society. As many fear more quakes that may take place on the crucial day, Prime Minister Lee Nak-Yeon ordered officials to deploy \"all government resources possibly available\" to ensure that Thursday\'s test is held smoothly. Even Seoul\'s financial markets and many businesses open late on the day to clear traffic for test-takers, with airport landing and takeoffs suspended for 30 minutes during the main language listening test. Local nuclear reactors were operating without disruption, Yonhap news agency said, citing officials at Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power. The most powerful quake recorded in the South was a 5.8- magnitude tremor that hit the southeastern city of Gyeongju in September last year.

'Pinning the responsibility on consumer goods companies for reduction in prices following the recent cut in GST rates, finance secretary Hasmukh Adhia on Saturday said that the companies have to ensure an immediate cut in prices across the retail chain to avoid facing anti-profiteering action by the government.“The company, which is selling products with MRP, has to ensure that its entire chain of wholesalers, retailers are informed and has to ensure that after November 15, the retailer charges MRP after taking into consideration the reduction in tax rate from 28 per cent to 18 per cent. This is very important. That’s why I again want to appeal to FMCG companies that if they want to be safe from anti-profiteering action then they have to ensure that their whole retail chain is informed…” Adhia, who also holds the charge of revenue secretary, told Doordarshan News.On restaurants raising prices even after a reduction in tax rate to 5 per cent, Adhia said that if there are genuine cases of input cost going up, they are free to increase prices, if it is permitted by competition. He said that as per the earlier GST rates of 18 per cent and 12 per cent for AC and non-AC restaurants, respectively, along with input tax credits, restaurants were told to cut prices. Though some big restaurant chains did so, there were some complaints from consumers for facing the entire burden of taxation, he added.“The complaints against restaurants were that they imposed 18 per cent on menu price. This used to disturb consumers… some restaurants had to take huge credit for inputs because they have their commercial premises on lease but 90 per cent of restaurants were such who need not take much ITC because the items used are either in nil or 5 per cent tax slab… so, 5 per cent was decided without input tax credit. So that the blame of increase in price does not come on the government.After 5 per cent tax if any restaurant wants to increase their prices because their input cost has gone up, then they are free to do it if the competition permits. Because restaurant sector is mostly covered by competition. Keeping all this in mind we have decided this (5 per cent GST rate) and I think very few anti-profiteering action will be required on restaurants,” he said.The GST Council had last week announced a cut in the rates of over 200 items, as well as a cut in the GST rate for all restaurants, barring those in starred hotels, to 5 per cent. Rates of 178 items, mostly consumer items of daily use, were reduced from the highest tax slab of 28 per cent to 18 per cent. The new GST rates came into effect from Wednesday.Adhia said that even though the consumer affairs ministry has given time till December 31 for revision in MRP, the FMCG companies should ensure an immediate lowering of prices.“Yesterday (Friday), the consumer affairs ministry has allowed price revision till December but that does not mean that they do it any time till December. Price revision has to be done in one day. Even if it takes time to out revised label, the benefit to consumers has to be given immediately,” he said. Adhia added FMCG firms should advertise revised prices in newspapers.On concerns over small businesses coming under the lens of anti-profiteering authority, he said the authority will take action only against big organised sector companies. He added, “It might have happened that their cost has gone up genuinely by 2-3 per cent, but if there is a gap of 10 per cent in price, then the consumer should get to see the reduction. Don’t want any trouble for any industry but at the same time consumers should benefit.”',real
'Bundesliga top scorer Robert Lewandowski struck twice as champions Bayern Munich eased past Augsburg 3-0 on Saturday to make it eight wins in eight games in all competitions under coach Jupp Heynckes and open up a six-point lead at the top of the table.Lewandowski, sporting a new, peroxide-blond hairstyle, grabbed Bayern’s second goal not long after Arturo Vidal’s 31st-minute opener and added another early in the second half, to take his league tally to 13 goals.The Poland striker has now scored 18 times against Augsburg in 13 Bundesliga matches, more than against any other club. The Bavarians, who have not dropped a point since Heynckes took over from Carlo Ancelotti last month, are top on 29, six ahead of RB Leipzig who drew 2-2 at Bayer Leverkusen. It was also Heynckes’ 500th Bundesliga win as coach and player, extending his own record.Borussia Dortmund, Bundesliga leaders only a few weeks ago, are in complete free fall, having dropped to third on 20 after their 2-1 loss at VfB Stuttgart on Friday, their fourth league defeat in their last five matches.Augsburg were bold and matched Bayern for half an hour before Vidal turned and fired in from close range for the lead. The Chilean then sent Lewandowski through with a defence-splitting pass to double it.The Pole then volleyed in a perfect Joshua Kimmich cross four minutes after the restart to knock their opponents out in a perfect dress rehearsal for their Champions League match at Anderlecht next week.Leverkusen proved too hard to crack for Leipzig as they came from a goal down twice to earn a point, with Kevin Volland netting the final equaliser in the 74th minute. Leverkusen played most of the second half with 10 men after the dismissal of Benjamin Henrichs.VfL Wolfsburg notched their first win under coach Martin Schmidt following seven successive draws, beating Freiburg 3-1 to climb to 13th.',real
'HARARE: Soldiers deployed across the Zimbabwe capital Harare and seized the state broadcaster on Wednesday after 93-year-old President Robert Mugabe\'s ruling ZANU-PF party accused the head of the military of treason, prompting frenzied speculation of a coup. Just 24 hours after military chief General Constantino Chiwenga threatened to intervene to end a purge of his allies in Mugabe\'s ZANU-PF, a Reuters reporter saw armoured personnel carriers on main roads around the capital. Aggressive soldiers told passing cars to keep moving through the darkness. \"Don\'t try anything funny. Just go,\" one barked at Reuters on Harare Drive. Two hours later, soldiers overran the headquarters of the ZBC, Zimbabwe\'s state broadcaster and a principal Mugabe mouthpiece, and ordered staff to leave. Several ZBC workers were manhandled, two members of staff and a human rights activist said. Shortly afterwards, three explosions rocked the centre of the southern African nation\'s capital, Reuters witnesses said. Despite the troops stationed at locations across Harare, there was no word from the military as to the fate of Mugabe, Zimbabwe\'s leader of the last 37 years and the self-styled \'Grand Old Man\' of African politics. In contrast to his elevated status on the continent, Mugabe is reviled in the West as a despot whose disastrous handling of the economy and willingness to resort to violence to maintain power destroyed one of Africa\'s most promising states. In the only official word from the government, Isaac Moyo, Zimbabwe\'s ambassador to neighbouring South Africa, earlier dismissed talk of a coup, saying the government was \"intact\" and blaming social media for spreading false information. \"There\'s nothing really happening. They are just social media claims,\" Moyo told Reuters. The Southern African nation has been on edge since Monday when Chiwenga, Commander of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces, said he was prepared to \"step in\" to end a purge of supporters of sacked vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa. Only a few months ago, Mnangagwa, a former security chief nicknamed \"The Crocodile\", was favourite to succeed his life-long political patron but was ousted a week ago to pave the way for Mugabe\'s 52-year-old wife Grace to succeed him. \"Politics over the gun\" Chiwenga\'s unprecedented statement represented a major escalation of the struggle to succeed Mugabe, the only leader Zimbabwe has known since it gained independence from Britain in 1980. Mugabe chaired a weekly cabinet meeting in the capital on Tuesday, officials said, and afterwards ZANU-PF said it stood by the \"primacy of politics over the gun\" and accused Chiwenga of \"treasonable conduct ... meant to incite insurrection.\" The previous day, Chiwenga had made clear the army\'s refusal to accept the removal of Mnangagwa - like the generals a veteran of Zimbabwe\'s anti-colonial liberation war - and the presumed accession of Grace, once a secretary in the government typing pool. Local government minister Saviour Kasukuwere, a leading figure in her relatively youthful \'G40\' faction, refused to answer Reuters questions about the situation in Harare. \"I\'m in a meeting,\" he said, before hanging up shortly before midnight. Army, police and government spokesmen refused to answer numerous phone calls asking for comment. \"Defending our revolution\" Neither Mugabe nor Grace have responded in public to Chiwenga\'s remarks and state media did not publish his statement. The Herald newspaper posted some of the comments on its Twitter page but deleted them. The head of ZANU-PF\'s youth wing, which openly backs Grace, accused the army chief of subverting the constitution. \"Defending the revolution and our leader and president is an ideal we live for and if need be it is a principle we are prepared to die for,\" Youth League leader Kudzai Chipanga said at the party\'s headquarters in Harare. Grace Mugabe\'s rise has brought her into conflict with the independence-era war veterans, who enjoyed privileged status in Zimbabwe until the last two years when they spearheaded criticism of Mugabe\'s handling of the economy. In the last year, a chronic absence of dollars has led to long queues outside banks and an economic and financial collapse that many fear will rival the meltdown of 2007-2008, when inflation topped out at 500 billion percent. Imported goods are running out and economists say that, by some measures, inflation is now at 50 percent a month. According to a trove of intelligence documents reviewed by Reuters this year, Mnangagwa has been planning to revitalise the economy by bringing back thousands of white farmers kicked off their land nearly two decades ago and patching up relations with the likes of the World Bank and IMF. Whatever the outcome, analysts said the military would want to present their move as something other than a full-blown coup to avoid criticism from an Africa keen to leave behind the Cold War continental stereotype of generals being the final arbiters of political power. \"A military coup is the nuclear option,\" said Alex Magaisa, a UK-based Zimbabwean academic. \"A coup would be a very hard sell at home and in the international community. They will want to avoid that.\" Get latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.',real
'HARARE: Zimbabwe\'s army said on Wednesday it has President Robert Mugabe and his wife in custody and is securing government offices and patrolling the capital\'s streets following a night of unrest that included a military takeover of the state broadcaster. The night\'s action triggered speculation of a coup+ , but the military\'s supporters praised it as a \"bloodless correction.\" Armed soldiers in armored personnel carriers stationed themselves at key points in Harare, while Zimbabweans formed long lines at banks in order to draw the limited cash available, a routine chore in the country\'s ongoing financial crisis. People looked at their phones to read about the army takeover and others went to work or to shops. In an address to the nation after taking control of the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation, an army spokesman said early Wednesday the military is targeting \"criminals\" around Mugabe, and sought to reassure the country that order will be restored. It was not clear where Mugabe, 93, and his wife were Wednesday but it seems they are in the custody of the military. \"Their security is guaranteed,\" the army spokesman said. \"We wish to make it abundantly clear that this is not a military takeover,\" the army statement said. \"We are only targeting criminals around (Mugabe) who are committing crimes that are causing social and economic suffering in the country in order to bring them to justice.\" The spokesman added \"as soon as we have accomplished our mission, we expect that the situation will return to normalcy.\" The army spokesman called on churches to pray for the nation. He urged other security forces to \"cooperate for the good of our country,\" warning that \"any provocation will be met with an appropriate response.\" The statement called on troops to return to barracks immediately, with all leave canceled. Overnight, at least three explosions were heard in the capital, Harare, and military vehicles were seen in the streets. The military actions appear to put the army in control of the country. Army commander Constantino Chiwenga had threatened on Monday to \"step in\" to calm political tensions. Mugabe\'s ruling ZANU-PF party responded by accusing the general of \"treasonable conduct.\" But now Chiwenga appears to be in control. The army has been praised by the nation\'s war veterans for carrying out \"a bloodless correction of gross abuse of power.\" The military will return Zimbabwe to \"genuine democracy\" and make the country a \"modern model nation,\" said Chris Mutsvangwa, chairman of the war veterans\' association, told The Associated Press in Johannesburg. Mutsvangwa and the war veterans are staunch allies of Emmerson Mnangagwa, who was fired from his post of vice president by Mugabe last week. Mnangagwa fled Zimbabwe last week but said he would return to lead the country. The US Embassy closed to the public Wednesday and encouraged citizens to shelter in place, citing \"the ongoing political uncertainty through the night.\" The British Embassy issued a similar warning, citing \"reports of unusual military activity.\" For the first time, this southern African nation is seeing an open rift between the military and Mugabe, the world\'s oldest head of state who has ruled since independence from white minority rule in 1980. The military has been a key pillar of his power. Get latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.',real

'HARARE: Zimbabwe was set for more political turmoil today with protests planned as veterans of the independence war, activists and ruling party leaders called publicly for President Robert Mugabe to be forced from office. The marches will cap an unprecedented week in which generals seized power and put Mugabe under house arrest in a stunning turnaround for the president who has ruled since 1980. The 93-year-old autocrat did not resign in talks with the army chief on Thursday and sources suggested the veteran leader was \"buying time\" to negotiate an end to his 37 year reign. Mugabe appeared publicly for the first time at a pre- planned graduation ceremony in Harare on Friday, further stoking questions over the status of his discussions with General Constantino Chiwenga, who led the military power grab. Later in the day, eight of Mugabe\'s ruling party\'s 10 regional branches took to state television to call for him to go. Cornelius Mupereri, a spokesman for ZANU-PF\'s Midlands region, was one of several party barons to appear on ZBC\'s nightly news to read almost identical statements calling on Mugabe to quit. Chris Mutsvangwa, chairman of the independence war veterans\' association, said \"the game is up\" for Mugabe and announced street protests against the president. \"It\'s done, it\'s finished... The generals have done a fantastic job,\" he said at a press conference in Harare. \"We want to restore our pride and (Saturday) is the day... we can finish the job which the army started.\" The veterans\' association supports ousted vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa -- whose sacking sparked the army intervention on Tuesday. They are organising a gathering at a large sports field in a working class suburb on the outskirts of Harare. It was the location of Mugabe\'s first speech after returning from exile in Mozambique in 1979. Demonstrators had begun to arrive in the area by midnight local time. The US embassy in Harare warned its citizens to avoid another protest -- thought to be a pro-Mugabe counter- demonstration -- expected to take place in Robert Mugabe Square in the centre of the capital. Other demonstrations are expected elsewhere in the country today. Get latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.',real
'DHAKA: Myanmar soldiers \"systematically targeted\" Rohingya women for gang-rape during violence against the minority Muslim community which triggered an exodus to Bangladesh, an UN special envoy said today. Pramila Patten, a special representative of the UN Secretary-General on sexual violence in conflict, made the comments after visiting Bangladesh\'s southeastern district of Cox\'s Bazar where some 610,000 Rohingya have taken refuge in the last ten weeks. Many of these atrocities \"could be crimes against humanity\", she said. \"I heard horrific stories of rape and gang-rape, with many of the women and girls who died as a result of the rape,\" Patten told reporters in Dhaka. \"My observations point to a pattern of widespread atrocities, including sexual violence against Rohingya women and girls who have been systematically targeted on account of their ethnicity and religion.\" The sexual violence in Myanmar\'s northern state of Rakhine was \"commanded, orchestrated and perpetrated by the armed forces of Myanmar\", she said. \"The forms of sexual violence we consistently heard about from survivors include gang-rape by multiple soldiers, forced public nudity and humiliation and sexual slavery in military captivity.\" \"One survivor described being held in captivity by the Myanmar armed forces for 45 days, during which time she was repeatedly raped. Others still bore visible scars, bruises and bite marks attesting to their ordeal,\" Patten added. Deadly raids by Rohingya militants on Myanmar police posts on August 25 sparked ferocious reprisals against the community by the military in the mainly Buddhist nation. The special representative said others involved in the sexual violence include Myanmar border police and militias composed of Buddhists and other ethnic groups in Rakhine. Refugees are still streaming across the border from Rakhine into Bangladesh, where hundreds of thousands have settled in squalid camps. The UN now estimates the majority of the Rohingya once living in Rakhine -- previously estimated at around one million -- have fled a campaign of violence it has likened to ethnic cleansing. Patten said the sexual violence was a key reason behind the exodus and occurred in the context of \"collective persecution\" of the Rohingya. \"The widespread threat and use of sexual violence was clearly a driver and push factor for forced displacement on a massive scale and a calculated tool of terror aimed at the extermination and the removal of the Rohingya as a group,\" she said. For decades the Rohingya have faced persecution in Myanmar, where they are denied citizenship and denigrated as illegal \"Bengali\" immigrants.

'SHAH PORIR DWIP (Bangladesh: Nabi Hussain owes his life to a yellow plastic oil container. The 13-year-old Rohingya boy couldn\'t swim, and had never even seen the sea before fleeing his village in Myanmar. But he clung to the empty container and struggled across the water with it for about 2.5 miles, all the way to Bangladesh. Rohingya Muslims escaping the violence in their homeland of Myanmar are now so desperate that some are trying to swim to safety in neighboring Bangladesh. In just a week, more than three dozen boys and young men used cooking oil containers like life rafts to swim across the mouth of the Naf River and wash up ashore in Shah Porir Dwip, a fishing town and cattle trade spot. \"I was so scared of dying,\" said Nabi, a lanky boy in a striped polo shirt and checkered dhoti. \"I thought it was going to be my last day.\" In this Nov 4 photo, Nabi Hussain poses for a portrait with the yellow plastic drum he used as a flotation device while crossing the Naf river. (AP) Although Rohingya Muslims have lived in Myanmar for decades, the country\'s Buddhist majority still sees them as invaders from Bangladesh. The government denies them basic rights, and the United Nations has called them the most persecuted minority in the world. Just since August, after their homes were torched by Buddhist mobs and soldiers, more than 600,000 Rohingya have risked the trip to Bangladesh. \"We had a lot of suffering, so we thought drowning in the water was a better option,\" said Kamal Hussain, 18, who also swam to Bangladesh with an oil container. Nabi knows almost no one in this new country, and his parents back in Myanmar don\'t know that he is alive. He doesn\'t smile and rarely maintains eye contact. Nabi grew up in the mountains of Myanmar, the fourth of nine children of a farmer who grows paan, the betel leaf used as chewing tobacco. He never went to school. The trouble started two months ago when Rohingya insurgents attacked Myanmar security forces. The Myanmar military responded with a brutal crackdown, killing men, raping women and burning homes and property. The last Nabi saw of his village, all the homes were on fire. Nabi\'s family fled, heading toward the coast, passing dead bodies. But when they arrived at the coast with a flood of other Rohingya refugees, they had no money for a boat and a smuggler. Every day, there was less food. So after four days, Nabi told his parents he wanted to swim the delta to reach the thin line of land he could see in the distance — Shah Porir Dwip. His parents didn\'t want him to go. One of his older brothers had left for Bangladesh two months ago, and they had no idea what had happened to him. They knew the strong currents could carry Nabi into the ocean. Eventually, though, they agreed, on the condition that he not go alone. So on the afternoon of Nov. 3, Nabi joined a group of 23 other young men, and his family came to see him off. \"Please keep me in your prayers,\'\' he told his mother, while everyone around him wept. Nabi and the others strapped the cooking oil containers to their chests as floats, and stepped into the water just as the current started to shift toward Bangladesh. The men stayed in groups of three, tied together with ropes. Nabi was in the middle, because he was young and didn\'t know how to swim. Read this story in Marathi Nabi remembers swallowing water, in part because of the waves and in part to quench his thirst. The water was salty. His legs ached. But he never looked behind him. Just after sundown, the group reached Shah Porir Dwip, exhausted, hungry and dehydrated. Nabi is now alone, one of an estimated 40,000 unaccompanied Rohingya Muslim children living in Bangladesh. He looks down as he speaks, just a few feet from the water, and murmurs his biggest wish: \"I want my parents and peace.\'\' Late afternoon on the next day, authorities spotted a few dots in the middle of the water. It was another group of Rohingya swimming to Bangladesh with yellow plastic containers. They arrived at the same time as a pack of cattle — except that the cows came by boat.

'A leading figure among religious liberals says the candidacy of Republican Roy Moore for US Senate is a struggle for the “soul of the nation.”The remarks Saturday by the Rev. William J. Barber come a day after a letter signed by dozens of progressive pastors in Alabama said Moore _ dogged by recent allegations of inappropriate conduct toward teenage girls decades ago _ is unfit to serve.Barber, former head of the North Carolina NAACP, spoke at an anti-Moore rally at the Tabernacle Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, that drew more than 100 people. The event was in direct contrast to a news conference Thursday during which religious conservatives expressed their commitment to Moore, who describes himself as a conservative Christian who hews to family values.Signs carried by Moore opponents at Saturday’s rally decried his opposition to gay and transgender rights. Moore was also criticized for opposing federally backed health care, assistance for the needy and more.Barber and other speakers claimed Moore’s campaign is fueled by a perversion of Christianity linked with white supremacy, and Moore is trying to take those forces to the Senate.“What is happening now in Alabama matters for the soul of the nation,” said Barber, of Goldsboro, North Carolina, and the force behind the “Moral Monday” protest movement that calls for greater rights for gays and minorities.On Friday, more than 50 Alabama pastors signed a public letter stating Moore isn’t fit to serve in the US Senate. The letter continued to collect signatures Saturday.The letter says Moore demonstrated “extremist values” incompatible with traditional Christianity even before recent allegations of sexual misconduct involving young women.The pastors cite Moore’s opposition to the expansion of Medicaid, which provides health care for the poor. It also accuses him of denigrating people from other countries and faiths and cites his opposition to homosexuality.The letter was written by a group of pastors in Birmingham. It includes the signatures of ministers from mainstream and liberal denominations including Methodists, Presbyterians, Episcopalians, the United Church of Christ and some moderate Baptists.Moore still enjoys the support of conservative evangelical leaders, but he has ignored mounting calls from Washington Republicans concerned that if he stays in the race he may not only lose a seat they were sure to win but also may do significant damage to the party’s brand among women nationwide as they prepare for a difficult midterm election season.Since last week, Moore has been engulfed by accusations of sexual misconduct toward women in their teens when he was a deputy district attorney in his 30s. Several of his accusers have allowed their identities to be made public.One said Moore molested her when she was 14. Another said Moore assaulted her when she was a 16-year-old waitress after he offered to drive her home. Five others said Moore pursued romantic relationships with them when they were between the ages of 16 and 18.',real
'NEW DELHI: The CIC has ordered the Railway Board to provide information to an applicant who was denied data as the RTI request was deemed to have been made by a \"corporate body\". The Commission observed that the CPIO\'s plea was \"not maintainable\", citing previous decisions where it was held that if the RTI application is signed by an individual who is a citizen of India, \"then notwithstanding the capacity in which such application is filed, it shall be valid\". The order came on an RTI filed by Vinay Gupta, who had sought information from the ministry of railways in December 2016 on the details of losses incurred by the Railways from 2012-16 and the steps taken by the Railways to overcome such loss. The central public information officer (CPIO) had denied the information, claiming that \"corporate bodies and juristic persons cannot apply for information under the Act. It is accordingly ruled that if a person applies for information to a public authority as a representative of a corporate body, then he/she is not entitled to information under the Act.\" Gupta, the information commissioner Amitava Bhattacharyya observed in his order, had submitted his RTI application on a paper having the letter head of an NGO, National Human Rights Committee. Bhattacharyya said in his order, \"But this cannot be construed to deny him information under the RTI Act.\" The order by Bhattacharyya then goes on to direct the central public information officer to provide the relevant information within 15 days of the receipt of the order, as well as send a report containing the copy of the revised reply and the date of dispatch of the same to the appellant within seven days. Bhattacharyya also cites several earlier cases where the Commission had ruled that use of letter heads doesn\'t disqualify the applicant from seeking information under the RTI Act. \"In conclusion we direct that an application/appeal from an Association or a Partnership Firm or a Hindu undivided Family or from some other group of individuals constituted as a body or otherwise should be accepted and allowed,\" an order dated March 20, 2012 of the CIC had ruled.

'NEW DELHI: Concerned over safety of children in schools, particularly keeping in mind the recent murder of 7-year-old Pradhyumn Thakur at Ryan International School Bhondsi, the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) has written to prominent schools across the country including KVs, DPS, Doon and Scindia, offering professional security consultancy services on how to make the school environment safe for children. The central paramilitary force, mandated to provide security to critical installations including airports, national monuments and government buildings, has told the schools it can help create \"safe and secure\" environment for children, with a consultancy service fee of Rs 4 lakh for an average school. The schools approached in Delhi NCR include Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti, the Delhi Public School Society, the Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan, Springdales School Pusa Road, Salwan Education Trust, President of DAV College Managing Committee, Modern School Barakhamba, Tagore International, Ramjas Foundation, Sanskriti, Birla Vidya Niketan, Sardar Patel Vidyalaya, The Mothers International, Shri Ram School, Ahlcon International and Apeejay Education Society. Subsequently, CISF has offered its services to Ryan Group of Schools, Mumbai; Podar Education Group in Mumbai; Doon School and Aditya Birla Management Corporation in Dehradun; Scindia School Gwalior and Rishi Valley in Chittoor. CISF has provided in past security consultancy services to prestigious educational institutions like IITs, IIMs, NITs, Dhirubhai Ambani International School etc. CISF writing to schools comes in the wake of the brutal murder of Thakur at Ryan School, Gurugram on September 8, in which CBI has arrested a Class 11 student. \"It is felt that in the wake of the recent unfortunate incident in one of the reputed schools in the national capital region (NCR) in which a young student lost his life, there is now a need for revisiting the security infrastructure of our schools. You will agree that a healthy and secure environment is a right of every child and schools have a major role to play in the providing the same,\" the CISF letter addressed to school principals read. CISF Director General O P Singh said the force took the initiative as part of its responsibility towards society. \"We are the best-suited government agency for doing such expert security consultancies and in preparing safe environments. We need to ensure the safety of the school-going children. About 200 institutions of national repute are our satisfied clients under this umbrella,\" he said. The force has assured the schools that its professional but chargeable security solutions will be custom-made for them like it does for each of its clients. \"We firmly believe that out consultancy will assist in finalising the blue print for effective security and fire protection of your esteemed educational institutions,\" the CISF has told the schools. It said that its security audit report will \"cover aspects related to integrated security solutions, student and faculty protection and any specific requirement put forth by them.\" A senior officer of the force said after the first set of offer letters were dispatched a few days ago, three reputed schools from Delhi have already approached them with a positive word. The official said the CISF security consultancy, used by Infosys, Reliance, the Sebi (Securities and Exchange Board of India) and AIIMS among others, will cost one-fourth as what is charged by some private players in this domain. \"So, for an average school that we are talking about, an amount of about Rs 4-4.5 lakh would be incurred as the CISF consultancy fee. The private players charge as much as Rs 20 lakh for the same job,\" he said. He said once the client agrees for the consultancy, a team of CISF experts from its special unit visit the premises that is to be audited and hand over the final report from a time period ranging between 3-4 months. The report tells the client where to install CCTV cameras, where to deploy security staff, how to check access control, how to train their security staff and install emergency response gadgets. \"The effort is to make the security system professional and competent. The security consultancy is also added with the fire audit where anti-blaze and counter-fire measures are suggested,\" he said.

'BUENOS AIRES: Hopes of finding survivors from a missing Argentine submarine with 44 crew members aboard have been revived after the navy said it had detected what could be distress calls. There has been no contact with the ARA San Juan since early Wednesday, prompting Buenos Aires to launch an air and sea search with help from countries including Brazil, Britain, Chile, Uruguay and the United States. The search has, however, been complicated by stormy conditions, Argentine navy spokesman Enrique Balbi said on Saturday. However, the defense ministry said it had detected seven satellite-transmitted signals that may be an attempt by the submarine to resume contact. The signals were received at 10:52 am (1352 GMT) and 3:42 pm (1842 GMT) on various naval bases with the help from US satellite communication experts, but they did not lock in, thus preventing a full connection. \"Right now, we are working to pinpoint the exact location of what is emitting the signals,\" presuming that it could be the missing sub, the ministry said. Early Sunday, the US Southern Command said it was sending a second Navy P-8A Poseidon aircraft to join the search. The Florida-based plane and a crew of 21 are to reach Argentina later in the day. A NASA P-3 research aircraft is already participating in the search, Southern Command said. The California-based Undersea Rescue Command earlier said it was deploying two underwater crafts designed to rescue trapped submarine sailors at different depths, as well as a remotely-operated underwater robot known as an ROV. \"We will do what is necessary to find the submarine as soon as possible,\" Argentine President Mauricio Macri wrote on Twitter. All land communications bases along the coast were ordered to scan for any followup, as family members of the missing waited nervously in the coastal city of Mar del Plata. Claudio Rodriguez, whose brother Hernan is aboard the submarine, was hopeful, saying the satellite signals suggested the vessel was still afloat and would be found. \"They\'ve got to be afloat. Thank God,\" he said. \"That gives us hope, because we knew that if they were down below, they would be screwed,\" he told TN news from the western city of Mendoza. The navy has not ruled out any hypothesis, a spokesman said. The most likely scenario given is that a power short may have unexpectedly cut off the vessel\'s communications. The San Juan is a TR-1700 class diesel-electric submarine which had been returning from a routine mission to Ushuaia near the southernmost tip of South America, to its base at Mar del Plata, some 400 kilometers (250 miles) south of Buenos Aires. Among those on board is Argentina\'s first female submarine officer, 35-year-old weapons officer Eliana Krawczyk. It is one of three submarines in the Argentine fleet. Sixty-five meters (213 feet) long and seven meters (23 feet) wide, it was built by Germany\'s Thyssen Nordseewerke and launched in 1983. It underwent a re-fit between 2007 and 2014 to extend its usefulness by some 30 years. At the Vatican, Argentine-born Pope Francis said he offered \"his fervent prayer\" for the safety of the submarine sailors.

'GUWAHATI: A Supreme Court bench headed by Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra, Justice A M Khanwilkar and Justice D Y Chandrachud on Monday directed chief secretaries of all states to issue advisory to all the recognized schools asking them to spread awareness against \"blue whale\" and other life-threatening games. The order came in response to a writ petition filed by Supreme Court advocate Sneha Kalita seeking appropriate guidelines for regulation and monitoring of virtual digital online games including \'blue whale\', \'a silent house\', \'a sea of whales\', \'wake me up at 4:20am\' etc. \" The court directed+ that while issuing such advisory by the state governments, the guidelines for safe and effective use of the internet and digital technologies in schools and school busses issued by the Central Board of Secondary Education should be taken into account,\" Kalita told TOI.

'NEW DELHI: At a time when security in schools is a focus area, particularly after the recent murder of seven-year-old Pradhyumn Thakur at Ryan International School in Bhondsi, the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) has written to prominent schools across the country including Kendriya Vidyalayas, DPS, Doon and Scindia offering professional security consultancy on how to make the school environment safe for children . The paramilitary force, mandated to provide security to critical installations including airports, national monuments and government buildings, has told schools it can help create \"safe and secure\" environment for children. The force said it could provide consultancy services for just around Rs 4 lakh while some high profile schools spend Rs 20 lakh on private players for the same job. The CISF, however, will not provide its security to schools. Schools approached in the NCR include Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti, Delhi Public School Society, Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan, Springdales School Pusa Road, Salwan Education Trust, DAV College Managing Committee, Modern School Barakhamba, Tagore International, Ramjas Foundation, Sanskriti, Birla Vidya Niketan, Sardar Patel Vidyalaya, Mother\'s International, Shri Ram School, Ahlcon International and Apeejay Education Society. The CISF has also offered its services to Ryan Group of Schools, Mumbai; Podar Education Group in Mumbai; Doon School and Aditya Birla Managament Corporation in Dehradun; Scindia School Gwalior and Rishi Valley in Chitoor. Three reputed schools in Delhi have replied to the CISF and expressed desire to hire its services, said sources. \"It is felt that in the wake of the recent unfortunate incident in one of the reputed schools in the national capital region (NCR) in which a young student lost his life, there is now a need for revisiting the security infrastructure of our schools. You will agree that a healthy and secure environment is a right of every child and schools have a major role to play in the providing the same,\" the CISF letter addressed to school principals read. CISF director general O P Singh said the force took the initiative as part of its responsibility towards society. \"We are the best suited government agency for doing such expert security consultancies and in preparing safe environments. We need to ensure safety for school-going children,\" he said. The CISF has provided security consultancy to prestigious educational institutions like IITs, IIMs, NITs, Dhirubhai Ambani International School etc. Sources said CISF security consultancy, used by Infosys, Reliance, Securities and Exchange Board of India and AIIMS among others, will cost one-fourth of what is charged by some private players in this domain.

'Book- Hema Malini: Beyond the Dream Girl \r\nAuthor-Ram Kamal Mukherjee  \r\nPublisher- Harper Collins \r\nPages- 241\r\nPrice- Rs 599If you thought that Hema Malini: Beyond The Dream Girl, an authorised biography by Ram Kamal Mukherjee would, perhaps, answer all your questions about the various controversies that have mired the famed actor over decades, you will be sorely disappointed. It’s not a no-holds-barred book. It’s at best a well-written Wikipedia entry.It barely scratches the surface of the story of this Iyengar girl, who spent her initial years — 14 to be precise — in Delhi, and then, eventually, moved to Chennai (then Madras). The biography traverses the predictable path of recounting Hema’s childhood years, strict Tamilian upbringing under the watchful eyes of her mother Jaya Chakravarti and her rigorous Bharatnatyam training.The transition from a stage performer to her film debut opposite Raj Kapoor in Sapno Ka Saudagar is all chronicled, but what is missing is the human element. What did a 16-year-old girl, who was making her debut opposite the biggest name in the industry at the time, feel about how fast her life was changing? Did she struggle with her strong Tamil accent in what was a predominantly Hindi speaking industry? What we get instead is a gilded portrait of an actor and a highly accomplished performer, who never fumbles and is praised by all.The much talked-about scandal — her marriage to superstar Dharmendra, who was already married, is also kept under the carpet. While the love and affection the two share is brought out in the open, their courtship and wedding get no mention.If you pay attention closely, though, the book is good for filmi trivia. One gets to know that the famous comic scene from Sholay — where Amitabh Bachchan advertises Dharmendra’s viability as a groom to Basanti’s maternal aunt, is inspired from a real life incident. Javed Akhtar, who co-wrote the film with Salim Khan, wished to marry Honey Irani.Khan was dispatched to Irani’s family to win them over for Akhtar. Apparently, Khan kept singing praises of Akhtar and undercutting him at the same time. In the book, there’s also a mention of how Jeetendra was supposed to marry Hema, but, ultimately, married his long-time girlfriend Shobha, instead.',real
'TOKYO: Japan\'s parliament on Wednesday formally re-elected Shinzo Abe as prime minister after his party\'s crushing election victory, setting the 63-year-old on track to become the country\'s longest-serving premier. MPs voted by a huge majority to re-install Abe, after his conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) swept to a two-thirds \"super majority\" on October 22. During the campaign Abe had stressed the need for strong leadership to deal with what he called Japan\'s \"twin crises\", a belligerent and nuclear-armed North Korea and a shrinking birth rate. He has also vowed to start a debate on the controversial issue of making changes to Japan\'s US-imposed post-war constitution to bolster the role of the military in the formally pacifist country. In the 465-seat lower house, Abe won 312 votes from the conservative ruling bloc. In the 242-seat upper house, Abe won a majority vote of 151 votes, returning him to the top Japanese political post. \"Our chamber nominates Mr Shinzo Abe as the prime minister,\" lower house speaker Tadamori Oshima declared after the televised vote. A beaming Abe then moved around the chamber, shaking hands with supporters. Despite his overwhelming victory in the October polls, Abe\'s popularity ratings are relatively low and most observers attribute his election success to a weak and fractured opposition. The main opposition party, the Democratic Party (DP), effectively disbanded after Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike launched a new conservative group and vowed to do away with \"old school politics\". Several DP lawmakers defected to Koike\'s new \"Party of Hope\" and the more left-leaning MPs formed a new party, the Constitutional Democrats. In the end, Koike\'s support imploded, mainly because she failed to stand herself in the election -- confusing voters who did not know who would be premier if she won. The Party of Hope finished with a mere 50 seats while the Constitutional Democrats won 55. They were both dwarfed by Abe\'s conservative coalition, which secured 313 lower house seats and obtained the \"super majority\" required to change the constitution.

'Title: How To Travel Light\r\nAuthor: Shreevatsa Nevatia\r\nPublisher: Penguin Random House\r\nPages: 248\r\nPrice: Rs 399When a bouncer and a doctor barge into Shreevatsa Nevatia’s bedsit to take him away to rehab, he grabs a copy of Karl Ove Knausgaard’s Boyhood Island to take with him. At the rehab, he lends the copy to a fellow inmate who returns it the next day saying: “Honesty is boring, man.”Nevatia epigraphs his book with a Raymond Carver quote: “Write about what you know, and what do you know better than your own secrets?” Nevatia’s secret is his bipolar condition, and he writes of it with unflinching honesty, an honesty that is lacerating, entertaining even, but never boring. That the writing bores into you like an electric drill is a different matter altogether.‘The highs and the lows/ And the to’s and the fro’s/ They left me dizzy’, sang Pete Doherty in ‘I No Longer Hear the Music’. In How to Travel Light, Nevatia describes both the delusions of mania and the inevitable crash that follows in clear, unadorned prose. This is a beautifully structured, skilfully nuanced and flamboyantly written book. It’s the message in the bottle that’s washed up on the shore, after the turbulent waves have receded.Nevatia uses cinema, literature and Hindu mythology to come to terms with his condition. Shiva stands for anarchic lucidity. Vishnu brings order. Literature is as important as lithium in the Nevatian scheme of things.He examines an episode of childhood trauma when he is sexually abused, over a period of time, by a family member without sentimentality or judgement. He is uneasy with easy cause and effect scenarios. There is clarity in ambiguity.He describes doctors both good and bad, rehabs that are like ‘dictatorial kindagartens’, where social workers come to test the general knowledge of inmates (one test involves naming India’s state capitals) and therapists who think his problem will be solved by reading Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus. But the writer is on a level a few notches higher. As he’s dragged to a doctor for the umpteenth time, he enters the clinic raging: ‘So, what’s it going to be today? Freud, Lacan, Jung?’When having a manic episode, he becomes a smooth operator with women, enters Internet chat rooms with multiple fake identities and spends money like water, once buying two hundred pounds worth of books as a student in England. He leaves the choice of books to the assistant who happily introduces him to the Complete Stories of Flannery O’ Connor, among others.He leaves 56 posts in 24 hours on his Facebook wall, feels he’s being followed by intelligence agencies and when hospital bouncers come to get him, is convinced that they have been sent by Narendra Modi. He colour codes his books: “To mark something vital, I used my purple pen. If I came across prose I envied, I brought out my pink highlighter. Black was used in the margins of books, and green always meant ‘rework’.”Nevatia writes with tenderness about his relationship with his parents, the helpless cycle of anger, outburst, remorse and crippling guilt. As the book ends we find him in a better place, aided by friends, family, medication and therapy: “There was suddenly more joy in the mundane than there was in Kafka. I grew averse to drama. The turbulent events of my life were best related with a smirk. Almost 10 years after I had been diagnosed as bipolar, I was no longer a victim of my affliction.”',real
'Even as protests by farmers ebbed in most parts of the state, the confrontation between sugar millers and cane growers in Solapur showed no sign of abating, with the growers taking to the streets again to voice their demand. Solapur, the home district of state Minister for Cooperatives Subhash Deshmukh, has been witnessing violence with cane growers disrupting the movement of cane demanding Rs 2,700 as first installment payment.At the start of the crushing season 2017-18, there were reports of violence from several districts of the state, as cane growers locked horns with millers over the first installment payment. In the cane belt of Sangli and Kolhapur, the confrontation was resolved after millers agreed to pay Rs 200 over the fair and remunerative price (FRP) as the first installment. During the agitation over FRP earlier this week, two farmers were injured in Ahmednagar, when police fired on the agitators. While the protests have died out in most parts of the state, it continues in Solapur.Ravikant Tupkar, leader of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, said farmers are asking for Rs 2,700 as the first installment payment. Millers in the region have expressed their inability to pay the amount. Senior millers pointed to the low sugar recovery in the region, which made the payment non-feasible. A meeting between millers and protesting farmers called by the sugar commissioner on Friday failed to resolve the deadlock.',real
'NEW DELHI: Congress president Sonia Gandhi today tore into the Narendra Modi government for its \"arrogance\", for \"locking the temple of democracy\" and for \"destroying the future of the poor\", reported ANI. Her first two criticisms related to the delay in the Winter Session+ of Parliament. The Congress has said the Centre was using the upcoming state Assembly polls in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh as an excuse to avoid facing Parliament. \"The Modi government in its arrogance has cast a dark shadow on India\'s Parliamentary democracy by sabotaging the Winter Session on flimsy grounds. It\'s mistaken if it thinks by locking the temple of democracy, it\'ll escape constitutional accountability ahead of elections,\" said Sonia at a meeting of the Congress Working Committee she chaired at her residence today. When referring to the Centre \"destroying the future of the poor\", the Congress president was talking about demonetisation and the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). The Congress and other opposition parties have said that GST was shoddily and hastily rolled out. \"The Prime Minister had the audacity to have a midnight celebration in Parliament to launch an ill-prepared and flawed GST, but today he lacks the courage to face Parliament,\" said Sonia. She was referring to the grand ceremony on June 30 in Parliament\'s Central Hall for the launch of GST. The circular-shaped Central Hall had last hosted such a function when it marked 50 years of Independence in 1997. The decision to demonetise by scrapping high-value currency notes was ill-conceived, said Sonia, adding that it \"left millions of people suffering\". \"A year later, demonetization has done nothing but rub salt on the wounds of distressed farmers, small traders, housewives and daily workers. The fortunes of a handful are being built by destroying the future of the poor and the oppressed,\" said Sonia. The Congress president also said the Centre is \"forcefully\" trying to change the history of modern India by \"erasing contributions\" made by Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi. The Congress Working Committee meeting was called today to decide on the schedule of party elections. Party vice president Rahul Gandhi\'s elevation is now all set, with election for the post of president+ announced for December 16 and counting of votes scheduled for December 19. The party said that notification for the post of Congress president will be issued on December 1, while nominations will have to be filed on December 4. In case there is no candidate apart from Rahul Gandhi, the Congress will announce his candidature on the last date of scrutiny, which is December 5. Rahul Gandhi is expected to be the only candidate in the fray, sources said to PTI.

'MANILA, Philippines: Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte stopped construction work on a newly formed sandbar in the disputed South China Sea after China protested, the defense chief said on Wednesday, disclosing details of the territorial spat for the first time. The dispute over a string of sandbars called Sandy Cay emerged in August and prompted China and the Philippines to consider negotiating some sort of arrangement to prevent such incidents from spiraling out of control, Lorenzana said. The rift over the tiny sandbar, where Filipinos planned to erect fishermen\'s shelters, in the group near Philippine-occupied Thitu island in the Spratlys archipelago remains unresolved but both sides pledged not to occupy any new territory, he said. China\'s claims to most of the South China Sea overlap those of the Philippines and four other governments. Despite that, tensions have eased since Duterte took over as president last year and took steps to thaw once-frosty relations with Beijing. Duterte has courted Chinese trade and assistance and taken a nonconfrontational approach to their territorial disputes. He has refused to immediately take up with China a ruling by a UN-linked tribunal that invalidated Beijing\'s sprawling claims in the South China Sea, sparking criticism from nationalists and left-wing groups, which wanted him to demand immediate Chinese compliance with the landmark decision. \"We tried to put some structures in one of the sandbars near our island and the Chinese reacted,\" Lorenzana told a diplomatic and security forum in Manila, adding that Duterte later ordered, \"Let\'s pull out.\" Duterte made the decision after Foreign Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano advised him of an agreement involving China and the Philippines for a halt on new construction in the disputed waters, Lorenzana later told a news conference. \"We brought up people there to occupy, to put up structures for our fishermen,\" Lorenzana said. He said the Chinese \"complained that we are occupying a new feature.\" Philippine foreign affairs and military officials refused to divulge details of the dispute at Sandy Cay in August. A government security report seen by the AP in August said three Chinese navy ships, a Chinese coast guard ship and 10 Chinese fishing vessels took positions off Sandy Cay after spotting the Filipinos on the barren sandbar. The nearest sandbar in Sandy Cay is about 2.5 nautical miles (4.6 kilometers) from Philippine-occupied Thitu Island. On Aug. 15, a blue Chinese helicopter flew low off Thitu\'s southwest coast, the report said. The Chinese military presence off Sandy Cay sparked concerns in Manila. Philippine Supreme Court Senior Associate Justice Antonio Carpio, who has studied the disputes extensively, said then that the Chinese navy ships and other vessels encroached in the Philippine island\'s 12-nautical mile (22-kilometer) territorial waters. \"In short, Sandy Cay is a Philippine land territory that is being seized, to put it mildly, or being invaded, to put it frankly, by China,\" Carpio said. The long-unresolved disputes are among issues expected to get the spotlight at an annual summit of Southeast Asian nations and their Asian and Western counterparts in Manila next week. China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which includes four governments involved in the sea feud, agreed earlier this year on a framework for a long-proposed nonaggression pact in the disputed waters. The framework is to serve as a roadmap for negotiations on a so-called code of conduct in the often-volatile waterway. ASEAN, currently led by the Philippines, has come under criticism for failing to take more effective steps to rein in aggressive behavior in the disputed waters, including China\'s transformation of seven disputed reefs into islands with landfill. Many of the 10-nation bloc\'s members depend largely on China for trade, investment and aid. \"If ASEAN pursues an over-abundance of caution, it risks becoming only a bystander to the events within its own region,\" former Philippine Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario told the Manila forum Wednesday.

'SEOUL: North Korea may conduct additional missile tests this year to polish up its long-range missile technology and ramp up the threat against the United States, South Korea\'s spy agency said on Monday, adding that it was monitoring developments closely. North Korea is pursuing nuclear weapons and missile programmes in defiance of UN Security Council sanctions and has made no secret of its plans to develop a missile capable of hitting the US mainland. It has fired two missiles over Japan. The reclusive state appears to have carried out a recent missile engine test while brisk movements of vehicles were spotted near known missile facilities, Yi Wan-young, a member of South Korea\'s parliamentary intelligence committee which was briefed by Seoul\'s National Intelligence Service, said. No sign of an imminent nuclear test had been detected, Yi noted. The third tunnel at the Punggye-ri complex remained ready for another detonation \"at any time\", while construction had recently resumed at a fourth tunnel, making it out of use for the time being. \"The agency is closely following the developments because there is a possibility that North Korea could fire an array of ballistic missiles this year under the name of a satellite launch and peaceful development of space, but in fact to ratchet up its threats against the United States,\" the lawmakers told reporters after a closed-door briefing by the spy agency. North Korea defends its weapons programmes as a necessary defence against US plans to invade. The United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war, denies any such intention. Pyongyang is also carrying out a sweeping ideological scrutiny of the political unit of the military for the first time in 20 years, according to Kim Byung-kee, another lawmaker in the committee. The probe was led by the ruling Workers\' Party\'s Organisation and Guidance Department and orchestrated by Choe Ryong Hae, who once headed the General Political Bureau of the Korean People\'s Army himself until he was replaced by Hwang Pyong So in May 2014. As a result, Hwang and Kim Won Hong, who Seoul\'s unification ministry said was removed from office in mid-January as minister of the Stasi-like secret police called \"bowibu\", had been punished, the lawmaker said. He did not elaborate. Choe, who was subjected to political \"reeducation\" himself in the past, appears to be gaining more influence since he was promoted in October to the party\'s powerful Central Military Commission. The National Intelligence Service indicated that Choe now heads the Organisation and Guidance Department, a secretive body that oversees appointments within North Korea\'s leadership. \"Under Choe\'s command, the Organisation and Guidance Department is undertaking an inspection of the military politburo for the first time in 20 years, taking issue with their impure attitude toward the party leadership,\" the lawmaker, Kim, said. Separately on Monday, South Korea approved a request by a South Korean to attend an event in the North marking the anniversary of the death of his mother who formerly led the Chondoist Chongu Party, a minor North Korean political party. The son, identified only by his surname Choi, will be the first South Korean to visit the North since liberal President Moon Jae-in took office in May. He is scheduled to arrive in Pyongyang via China on Wednesday and return on Saturday, according to Seoul\'s unification ministry.

'MANILA: A draft of the statement to be issued after a Southeast Asian summit makes no mention of the exodus of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar\'s Rakhine state following a military crackdown that has been described by the United Nations as ethnic cleansing. One paragraph of the communique, seen by Reuters on Monday, mentions the importance of humanitarian relief provided for victims of natural disasters in Vietnam and a recent urban battle with Islamist militants in the Philippines, as well as \"affected communities\" in northern Rakhine state. The statement was drawn up by the Philippines, current chair of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) - which includes Myanmar - whose leaders met for a plenary session in Manila on Monday. The draft did not give any details of the situation in northern Rakhine state or use the term Rohingya for the persecuted Muslim minority, which Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi has asked foreign leaders not to use. The government in mostly-Buddhist Myanmar regards the Rohingya as illegal migrants from Bangladesh and does not recognize the term. Well over 600,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh to find shelter in refugee camps after military clearance operations were launched in response to attacks by Rohingya militants on security posts on Aug. 25. The plight of the Rohingya has brought outrage from around the world and there have been calls for democracy champion Suu Kyi to be stripped of the Nobel peace prize she won in 1991 because she has not condemned the Myanmar military\'s actions. In September, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the situation in Rakhine was best described as ethnic cleansing. Some members of ASEAN, particularly Muslim-majority Malaysia, have voiced concern. However, in keeping with ASEAN\'s principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of one another, the issue appears to have been put aside at the summit. Suu Kyi, who did not mention the crisis in a pre-summit speech after arriving in Manila on Sunday, criticized ASEAN\'s principle of non-interference in 1999 when she was fighting for democracy in a country then ruled by a military junta. \"This policy of non-interference is just an excuse for not helping,\" she wrote in an opinion column in the Thai daily the Nation at the time. \"In this day and age, you cannot avoid interference in the matters of other countries.\" Get latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.',real
'Nisar Ahmed, 15, a rickshaw puller’s son, rewrote the Under-16 national record in the 100 metres with a timing of 10.85 seconds at the 33rd National Junior Athletics Championships. UP’s Rahul Sharma (11.05) and Maharashtra’s Karan Hegiste (11.11s) settled for the silver and bronze medal respectively at the Acharya Nagarjuna University athletics ground in Vijaywada on Saturday.This is not the first time that the Delhi boy has run below 11 seconds. This season he has three sub-11 timings, with his best effort of 10.76s coming at the School Nationals in Bhopal just a fortnight ago. His timings in Vijaywada, however, will be officially ratified by Athletics Federation of India. Ahmed’s gold-medal winning sprint bettered the four-year old record (11.1s) held by AS Arun of Tamil Nadu.Ahmed’s breakout performance came at the Delhi State Athletics meet in September where on the final day he clocked 11 seconds to bag the 100m gold. The victory also drew attention to the plight of the youngster, who lived with his family at the Bada Bagh slum in Azadpur area.Ahmed, believes the Delhi event was the turning point in his life and has spurred him on to break the national record. “I really want to thank the people who came up to help me after that race. I have improved so much now that I can afford better diet and equipment. I want them to continue to support me and guide me in my journey to become an international athlete,” Ahmed said over the phone.Ahmed says his phone hasn’t stopped ringing since he broke the Under-16 record. The first person to call, as always, was his mother who keenly follows her son’s progress.“I have been talking to her everyday. She tells me that she is praying for me everyday. She was really delighted when I told her about my record,” he says.Ahmed’s mother Shafikunisha, a domestic help, has never witnessed her son race. But the son forwarded a whatsapp video of the record-breaking feat to his mother.Ahmed, who is one of the most promising junior-level athletes in the country at the moment, trains at the Chhatrasal stadium under coach Sunita Rai.At Ahmed’s home, all his medals are kept in a plastic bag and the gold he won on Saturday will go into the same bag.“This has to be the best victory of my life,” he says.After a news report in The Indian Express highlighted Ahmed’s plight in September when he won gold at the state meet, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal met him. “They (government) asked me what I needed in writing. Hopefully, they will give my father the autorickshaw soon”Amoj rewrites 400m record Another Delhi boy Amoj Jacob broke the 11-year-old 400 metre record in the Under-20 category with a timing of 46.59s.

'Sri Lankan author Anuk Arudpragasam‘s “The Story of a Brief Marriage” — a touching tale of a young man trapped on the frontlines between the Sri Lankan army and the Tamil Tigers — has bagged the $25,000 DSC Prize for South Asian Literature 2017. The announcement was made at the magnificent Bangla Academy here during the closing ceremony of the three-day-long Dhaka Literature Festival on Saturday.“Writers are not race car drivers. We are not in some kind of a race. We are all working in silence, we write because we believe there are things that cannot be communicated in speech. It feels a little insincere to celebrate this award because my novel is about something so tragic,” said dArudpragasam after receiving the award. He announced he would donate one-third of the prize money to the organisations that work in Northern Sri Lanka, to Rohingya Muslims and to Kashmiri organisations providing succour in the troubled state.Apart from “The Story of a Brief Marriage,” the other four novels in the shortlist were Aravind Adiga’s “Selection Day”; Anjali Joseph’s “The Living”; Karan Mahajan’s “The Association of Small Bombs”; and “In the Jungles of the Night” by Stephen Alter.Jury chair Ritu Menon described Arudpragasam’s work as a “remarkable novel”, saying it had “several exceptional qualities”.“Writers don’t respect national or territorial borders. Judging the DSC Prize submissions for 2017 was both challenging as well as one of immense pleasure. It was a process marked with remarkable consensus.

'Book: A Tale of Two Victoria Crosses\r\nAuthor: Lt Gen Baljit Singh \r\nPublication: Pentagon Press \r\nPages: 82\r\nPrice: Rs 415Decorated soldiers have a pride of place in regimental histories. Their actions in the face of the enemy are extolled in the war records of the unit which took part in that particular battle and the exploits of such soldiers are used to enthuse new entrants into the regimental fold. A Tale of Two Victoria Crosses is a slim but very informative volume by Lt Gen Baljit Singh (retd), formerly of the Regiment of Artillery, primarily about a young infantry lieutenant who lost his place in the annals of the Indian Army despite having been decorated with the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest British gallantry award. Lt Karamjeet Singh Judge won the VC posthumously in Burma (now Myanmar) in World War II, while serving with the 4th Battalion of the 15th Punjab Regiment.After Partition, this battalion was allotted to the Pakistan Army, where it was re-named — it is now the 12 Punjab. The author argues that there are strong leads to suggest that Karamjeet’s company from the erstwhile 4/15 Punjab was transferred to the Sikh Regiment of Indian Army, but this is not recorded in official history. So while the Indian battalions and regiments who took part in the World Wars keep the memories of their decorated soldiers alive, Lt Judge’s battlefield exploits seem to have been lost to history.“Much of the recorded regimental history pertaining to Karamjeet’s Company and the deeds of its individuals got wiped out in the process of the subdivision of the erstwhile monolithic Indian Army,” writes Lt Gen Singh, “and Karamjeet’s name remains confined almost entirely to the pages of VC history.” Lt Judge’s VC has been reduced to a mere statistic, whereas it should be cherished by both the Indian Punjab Regiment and the 12 Punjab of Pakistan Army, “because battlefield valour transcends boundaries of friend and foe.”The book is an emotional outpouring of the author, whose first commanding officer, Lt Col Ajit Singh Judge, was the elder brother of Karamjeet. He describes in detail the action in the Battle of Meiktila in which Lt Judge laid down his life and was awarded the VC, and even managed to track down the British tank commander who witnessed the action and wrote the citation for his decoration.An interesting aspect of Lt Gen Baljit Singh’s efforts is the manner in which he links a British officer, Lt John Symth of 15 Sikhs, with Lt Karamjeet Singh Judge. Lt Smyth won his VC in the Battle of Ypres in World War I and according to the author, the young Indian officer and his brother were both inspired to join the Indian Army when they saw a poster depicting Smyth in Jalandhar. “Chalo, aapaan vi ik-ik Victoria Cross lae ke aayiae Bhraah-ji,” (Come, let’s also win a Victoria Cross each, brother) Karamjeet is quoted as saying to his brother before signing up for the Army.Coincidentally, Smythe was a major general commanding an infantry division in Burma in the World War II, where the young lieutenant he had inspired was also serving, although in a different theatre. While Lt Judge ultimately won a VC inspired by Smythe, unfortunately, the latter’s military career ended in ignominy when he was divested of his command for an operational failure and reduced from his acting rank of major general to lieutenant colonel.',real
'It started off with the Valentine\'s Day announcement capping stent prices. Prime Minister Narendra Modi talked about it in his campaign speeches in Uttar Pradesh the next day. Advertisements with his pictures reiterating his resolve to cap stent prices appeared in national dailies and billboards across the country. Healthcare was finally being acknowledged as a possible vote-getter at the highest level. The year 2017 may well go down as the year regulation of private healthcare became the Big Issue in response to growing public anger with rising costs and unnecessary treatment for profit. West Bengal (Trinamool), Kerala (Left), Karnataka (Congress) and Maharashtra (BJP-Sena) have all moved to regulate private healthcare. Barely a fortnight after stent price capping, on February 22, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee held a televised meeting with heads of private hospitals in Kolkata where she lashed out at them for overcharging patients and shoddy service, the two most common complaints. The fact that Banerjee chose to hold the health portfolio herself shows she realised its significance early on. On March 3, the West Bengal Clinical Establishments (Registration, Regulation and transparency) Bill, 2017 was passed unanimously in the assembly, a recognition of the public mood. Banerjee thundered: \"Some hospitals are overcharging patients, making exaggerated bills. The greed is crossing all limits. When the limits of patience are broken, steps have to be taken.\" The Indian Medical Association (IMA) and local doctors associations bitterly criticised the new law. They petitioned the governor and high court to repeal the act. Neither was in a mood to oblige. The governor gave his assent and the bill became law on March 17. The high court dismissed the petition on August 21. This is a recurring pattern across states -- repeated and determined efforts by governments to enact a law to regulate the private sector in the face of stiff opposition from doctors\' associations. While doctors\' strikes and demonstrations forced governments to back off on previous occasions, there is now little or no public sympathy for doctors and private hospitals. Sensing this, governments too are unwilling to be cowed down by the pressure tactics of corporate hospitals and doctors\' associations. \"Anger against the medical profession and the private healthcare system has been building up since a decade. It is evident in the rising incidents of violence against doctors and hospitals. But in Karnataka, the medical fraternity has been putting relentless pressure on the government to restrict regulation. Hats off to the government for taking a tough stance,\" said Dr N Devadasan of the Institute of Public Health in Bangalore. The Karnataka Private Medical Establishments (Amendment) Bill 2017 to regulate the private sector was tabled in the assembly in June. The IMA and local hospital associations went to court against the bill. They launched an indefinite strike, but had to call it off after the high court asked them to hold talks with the government. \"The doctors expected a lot of anger against politicians, especially the government. But common people are congratulating the government,\" added Dr Devadasan. In Mumbai, a hospital hoarding saying \"No Commission only honest opinion\" kicked off a row about doctors taking commissions from hospitals and diagnostic labs for referring patients. Responding to the outrage, in September, the state government released the draft Prevention of Cut Practice in Health Care Services Bill, 2017, the first in India to formally recognise the menace of cut practice. The bill proposes up to five years of imprisonment for demanding or accepting commissions. The 40,000-member strong IMA in Maharashtra protested vehemently but the government is moving ahead. In Kerala, with the highest per capita expenditure on health in the country, the drafting of the Kerala Clinical Establishments (Registration & Regulation) Bill 2017 started last year. Several cases of negligence or callousness in private hospitals leading to deaths this year fuelled public anger. Hospitals refusing to reduce their treatment expenses despite stent prices falling added to it. The state government in August introduced a bill to regulate all hospitals and diagnostic centres. The bill was sent to the subject committee on health and not the select committee. \"The subject committee means public hearings and a quicker process. Choosing this is a recognition of public support for the bill,\" said Dr B Iqbal, neurosurgeon and former vice chancellor of the University of Kerala. \"Clearly, the costs and the malpractices in private healthcare have become impossible to defend. This is just a one-shot attempt to contain costs, a knee jerk political response to the vocal dissatisfaction of the middle class and the elite with high costs. However, it is mostly about tertiary care, to which the poor have little access anyway. In reality, instead of improving and expanding the public sector, this is shifting the debate to how to improve access to private facilities. Allocation for public health facilities remains the same, showing just how serious governments actually are about addressing people\'s lack of access to affordable healthcare,\" said Dr Amit Sengupta of the Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, a network of organisations working on healthcare issues.

'KUALA LUMPUR (MALAYSIA): A northern Malaysian state has been paralyzed by a severe storm that led to two deaths and some 2,000 people evacuated in the worst flooding in years. Chief minister Lim Guan Eng says Penang, a popular tourist destination and manufacturing hub, has been hit by torrential rains and strong winds since late Saturday. Floodwaters have risen to 12 feet (3.6 meters), submerging houses in parts of the island. Army personnel have been deployed to help in the rescue operation.

'If you are going through stressful circumstances, it is advisable that you reconsider your decisions once again. People usually tend to make risky and abnormal decisions under chronic stress, a new study has found.Making decisions in this type of situation, known as a cost-benefit conflict, is dramatically affected by chronic stress.The study, published in the journal Cell, states that impairments of a specific brain circuit underlie this abnormal decision making and could further restore normal behaviour by manipulating this circuit.If a method for tuning this circuit in humans were developed, it could help patients with disorders such as depression, addiction, and anxiety, which often feature poor decision-making, the researchers noted.“We found a microcircuit of neurons in the striatum that we could manipulate to reverse the effects of stress on this type of decision making,” said Ann Graybiel, Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, the US.The researchers believe that this circuit integrates information about the good and bad aspects of possible choices, helping the brain to produce a decision.The team conducted a mice study, whereby rodents were allowed to choose between highly concentrated chocolate milk, which they like, under the presence of a bright light, which they don’t, and an option with dimmer light but weaker chocolate milk.Before experiencing stress, normal rats and mice chose to run towards the dimmer light and weaker chocolate milk about half the time. As the researchers gradually increased the concentration of chocolate milk in the dimmer side, the animals began choosing that side more frequently.',real
'MAIDUGURI: Four suicide bombers detonated in Nigeria\'s Borno state capital and killed 14 people while wounding another 29, police said on Wednesday, in one of the largest such attacks in the city in years. The deafening blasts could be heard in the evening in Maiduguri, the home of the Boko Haram extremist insurgency. Police spokesman Victor Isukwu said the two male and two female bombers targeted crowded parts of Muna Gari suburb. The first explosion went off at a prayer ground, he said. Police said the four bombers also were killed. The 29 injured were rushed to local hospitals for treatment. While Nigeria\'s military has made progress in combating Boko Haram\'s deadly insurgency, the group continues to carry out suicide attacks in Maiduguri and elsewhere. The group often uses female or child bombers, some who had been abducted. The extremist group has defied the government\'s claim made late last year that Boko Haram had been \"crushed\" after being flushed out of its strongholds. The insurgents continue to threaten parts of vast northern Nigeria and neighboring countries. Millions have been displaced in the nearly decade-old insurgency and more than 20,000 killed. The displacement has created a vast humanitarian crisis as hunger remains widespread. Isukwu said police teams were at the scene of Wednesday\'s blasts to ensure it was safe. \"Normalcy has been restored to the community,\" he said.

'JAKARTA: Named as a suspect in a $170 million corruption case, the speaker of Indonesia\'s parliament was put under armed guard at a hospital by anti-graft investigators after he was involved in a car accident, his lawyer said on Friday. Officers from the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) first tried to arrest Setya Novanto, the chairman of Golkar, Indonesia\'s second-largest party and partner in the ruling coalition, at his house in Jakarta late on Wednesday. The swoop, watched by television cameras, failed to find Novanto, sparking speculation that he had gone into hiding. On Thursday evening, the saga took a bizarre twist after reports Novanto was involved in a car crash while on his way to turn himself in at KPK headquarters. Novanto\'s lawyer, Fredrich Yunadi, said his client was being interviewed at the time of the accident by a journalist driving the vehicle. \"(The driver) was looking back and looking to the side, so he wasn\'t concentrating on what was in front of him,\" he said. Novanto was now \"very ill\" with head and hand injuries, Yunadi said. \"He can\'t even get up yet. He can\'t talk yet, it\'s just his eyes - when he opens his eyes the ceiling swirls in circles.\" Armed KPK officers were now at the hospital, Yunadi said, adding that they had ignored his requests to leave. Indonesian newspapers on Friday splashed pictures across their front pages of the black sport utility vehicle that Novanto was said to have been travelling in. It was resting against an electricity pole, and appeared to have suffered only minor damage to the front fender. Novanto has previously denied wrongdoing, but has repeatedly missed summonses from the KPK for questioning in recent months, saying he was ill and needed to undergo heart surgery. The KPK is investigating state losses amounting to about $170 million linked to a national electronic identity card (E-KTP) scheme after allegations that sums ranging from $5,000 to $5.5 million - generated by marking up procurement costs- were divided up among politicians in parliament. Novanto was named a suspect in the case again last week after he had used a controversial legal manoeuvre, a pre-trial motion, to get earlier charges dropped last month. Febri Diansyah, a KPK spokesman, said on Thursday that Novanto\'s car crash happened shortly after it had asked the Indonesian police chief and Interpol to place him on a wanted list. The KPK, Febri told Inews TV, would liaise with doctors to see if Novanto was \"fit to stand trial\" and vowed to continue its investigations into the case. Yunadi has said a request for another pre-trial motion had already been filed on behalf of his client. President Joko Widodo has said that the legal process should be followed and has backed the KPK against efforts by some members of parliament to weaken the independent agency\'s powers. Vice President Jusuf Kalla, who is also a Golkar member, told reporters on Thursday that Novanto should be ready to face any legal process if called upon. Allegations of corruptions have dogged Novanto for years, but he has never been prosecuted. Indonesians widely perceive parliament as one of their country\'s most corrupt institutions, Transparency International says.

'Italian football federation (FIGC) president Carlo Tavecchio said he has not slept since Monday’s World Cup elimination which he blamed firmly on coach Gian Piero Ventura.Ventura was sacked on Wednesday, two days after a goalless draw at home to Sweden meant that Italy failed to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1958.Tavecchio, 74, is under pressure to follow suit but has so far stood his ground.“The debacle was technical, the coach made the wrong technical choices,” he said in a trailer for a programme which will be broadcast by the Mediaset network on Sunday.“We played the wrong way; Sweden’s players are nearly all over one metre 90 and we kept crossing the ball into the penalty area. We needed our small players, but they were on the bench.”In the interview, conducted in the back seat of a car, Tavecchio accepted that it was his decision to appoint Ventura.“The coach was chosen by me. I’m under stress, I haven’t slept for four days,” he said with tears welling in his eyes.After the match, Ventura apologised for the result but not for the effort shown by his players.Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri said that neither goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon nor defender Andrea Barzagli, who both announced their international retirements after Monday’s game, would play in Sunday’s Serie A match at Sampdoria.Buffon won 175 caps for Italy and next year’s World Cup in Russia would have been the sixth for the 39-year-old.“Buffon and Barzagli are fine, they are getting over the disappointment but they won’t play,” Allegri told reporters.“Life goes on but they need time to get over it. After 15 days with the national team, which has absorbed a great amount of physical and nervous energy, it’s only right that they rest.”Allegri, who has won three successive Serie A titles with Juventus, said he was not interested in the Italy job for now.',real
'Book: Fifty Things That Made The Modern Economy\r\nAuthor: Tim Harford\r\nPublication: Little, Brown\r\nPages: 352 \r\nPrice: Rs 599When the makers of our Constitution incorporated Article 48, providing for a ban on the slaughter of cows and their progeny as a non-binding “directive principle of state policy”, there were a few thousand tractors and probably no power threshers or combine harvesters in use in farms across India. Chemical fertiliser application, too, was hardly 40,000 tonnes a year in nutrient terms, while artificial insemination didn’t extend beyond trials at the Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Bareilly. And most rural homes used dried dung cake as cooking fuel.Cut to the present, where we have tractor sales of 550,000-600,000 and fertiliser nutrient consumption at 27-28 million tonnes annually, while the 70 million-plus artificial inseminations during 2016-17 could theoretically cover over half of the country’s adult female bovine population.All these add up to a huge technological disruption. But more important are its socio-economic and cultural consequences. The cow — as the source of draught power, fertiliser-cum-fuel and milk — was an integral part of a largely agriculture-based civilisation. But with the advent of tractors, chemical fertilisers, artificial insemination and LPG cylinders, the gau was reduced to a mere milk-producing machine. The tensions now on the ground, between practical farmers and people violently yearning for an irrecoverable past, are no less a by-product of technology disruption.Tractors, combines, artificial insemination and LPG cylinders don’t figure in Tim Harford’s Fifty Things that Made the Modern Economy, though the Haber-Bosch process – which, by enabling use of atmospheric nitrogen to make ammonia, paved the way for mineral fertilisers — does. Some of the things in his list — infant formula, TV dinners and the pill — were transformative, no doubt, but perhaps more for women in advanced than in third-world settings. You cannot ultimately divorce technology from the specific contexts in which it is introduced.That tendency to not look beyond the industrialised capitalist world for game-changing innovations — the now-largely-forgotten C.K. Rajkumar’s idea of selling shampoos in sachets was no less pioneering than Ikea’s Billy bookcase — shouldn’t, however, take away from the insightfulness of the latest offering from the author of The Undercover Economist. The good part about Fifty Things is its readability; not only can you begin from any chapter, Harford himself follows no chronological order while dealing with the inventions he believes have really made our world today possible. Thus, the chapter on the light bulb comes at the very end, whereas those on the iPhone and Google search feature in the middle and towards the beginning, respectively. Not adhering to a historical timeline, indeed, allows for viewing things for what they are: the plough’s design and power source may have changed, but what it does today isn’t much different from the time when humans first turned from hunter-gatherers into settled agriculturalists.The plough, barbed wire and light bulb were inventions whose utility was immediate and obvious. This wasn’t the case, though, with the shipping container and the barcode. The idea of moving cargo in corrugated steel boxes that fitted neatly onto flatbed trucks and using cranes to lock, lift and load these directly on ships — as opposed to physical handling of individual goods in general cargo vessels — was original and elegant. But for it to take off required truckers, shipping companies and ports to come together and agree first on the standards for container sizes. The barcode similarly became a reality only when grocery makers had affixed these machine-readable distinctive black and white stripes on their products. But they wouldn’t do it until the food retailers had installed enough scanners.The same goes for electricity. By the early 1880s, Thomas Alva Edison had already built generating stations. Yet, less than five per cent of mechanical drive power in American factories, even in 1900, was coming from electric motors. The reason: Most factories were still running on steam power. Simply replacing steam engines with electric motors didn’t make sense to owners. Electricity could help raise manufacturing efficiency, but it meant having to change everything, from the production process to factory layout architecture. That happened only towards the late 1910s: “The thing about a revolutionary technology”, as Harford notes, “is that it changes everything”. Electricity did precisely that.It follows, then, that no technology can succeed without the willingness of potential users to reorganise their existing systems and processes. The power of a technology becomes evident only with a critical mass of adopters — who start discovering new ideas and avenues for its exploitation — and also when it combines with other technologies. Skyscrapers, for instance, were a result of at least three inventions – the elevator, air-conditioning and reinforced concrete — coming together. The modern glassy high rises, to quote Harford, would be “uninhabitable” without the air-conditioner, “unbuildable” without steel or reinforced concrete, and “inaccessible” without the elevator.An equally relevant point about inventions, especially today’s, is that they aren’t always the work of just the individuals with whom they are associated. Steve Jobs was a genius, but many of the iPhone’s key technologies — the internet which makes a smartphone a smartphone, the fast Fourier transform algorithms that swiftly turn analogue signals into digital, the touch screen or even the Siri voice-activated personal assistant — were originally developed by others, including the US Department of Defence and the European Organisation for Nuclear Research.Nor are the big inventions necessarily things. Harford mentions limited liability companies, double-entry bookkeeping and intellectual property as man-made ideas that were, nevertheless, game-changing. To these, we could add, perhaps, even the goods and services tax (GST) — the idea of a single national commodities tax levied on a value-added principle, wherein compliance becomes self-policing.Finally, technology creates both winners and losers. In the pre-gramophone era, a singer had to be physically present at a place to be heard. But with sound reproduction technology, her voice could reach a global audience.',real

'BANGKOK: Thailand has revoked the passports of ousted premier Yingluck Shinawatra, who has yet to be seen in public since she slipped out of the country before the verdict in her negligence trial, officials said Tuesday. The former prime minister, whose elected government was toppled in a 2014 coup, has not been seen or heard from since she stunned the kingdom by failing to turn up for the Supreme Court verdict in late August. She was later sentenced to five years in prison in absentia for failing to stop graft in a government rice policy- a case lambasted by her supporters as part of a broader junta effort to drive the ex-premier\'s family out of politics. \"All of Yingluck\'s passports have been revoked now,\" foreign minister Don Pramudwinai told reporters Tuesday. Yingluck had four Thai passports, two personal and two diplomatic, according to authorities. Yingluck\'s elder brother Thaksin, who was ousted as prime minister in a 2006 coup, has been living in self-exile for years to avoid a graft conviction. He has a home in Dubai and junta chief Prayut Chan-O-Cha said in late September that Yingluck was also in the emirate. While her current whereabouts remain unconfirmed, there are widespread reports the former premier is seeking asylum in Britain. \"I don\'t know (where she is),\" Prayut told reporters Tuesday. \"What\'s important is that the country she\'s residing must confirm her location with us,\" he added. The move comes after the expiry of a deadline for Yingluck to appeal against the verdict, making her return to Thailand highly unlikely. Analysts believe the junta likely cut a backroom deal with the politician to whisk her out of the country- a charge the generals deny. The Shinawatras are wildly popular in Thailand\'s rural heartlands, where voters wooed by their welfare schemes have helped them dominate elections for the past decade. But they are loathed by Bangkok\'s traditional army-allied elite, who have branded them as corrupt opportunists and repeatedly cut down their governments with coups, court rulings and protests. The ruling junta recently vowed to hold elections in November 2018, though a tight ban on political activities remains in place. Elections will not restore the same level of democracy the kingdom enjoyed before the coup. Under the junta\'s new charter elected politicians will be straitjacketed by an appointed Upper House and requirements to stick to a 20-year master plan.

'Wondering whether a Chardonnay pairs well with fish, or a nice juicy steak would work nicely with a Cabernet Sauvignon? In a few years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) would address these dilemmas for you, playing its part as a virtual sommelier, according to Robert Joseph, a wine expert, wine producer and author of an upcoming book on the future of wines.UK-based Joseph, who has authored 25 books, including “The Complete Encyclopedia of Wine”, has keenly watched developments in India’s nascent wine industry and says that Kashmir, with its climate and abundance of water, could be ideal for developing vineyards.Over the next few decades, the wine ecosystem would undergo a sea change, right from the manner in which consumers buy wine to involvement of machines in the production process and AI coming to the aid of wine buyers and enthusiasts when it comes to choosing the right vino.“AI will revolutionise wine-buying. I am going to tell my digital assistant, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant or Siri that I want to buy a bottle of red wine and it will say to me, ‘Do you want to have the one you had last time?’ It knows you so well, what you like and what your friends like. And what AI doesn’t know today, it will learn, very fast,” Joseph told IANS on the sidelines of ‘Sula Selections: Globe in a Glass Roadshow 2017’ event here.And of course, technology will determine the growth of the industry, right from the vineyards to sales.“Self-drive cars mean we will not have to worry about drinking and driving, spurring consumption. Labour is a big problem in the US and Europe. It will be possible to automate a vineyard completely within 5 to10 years. Robots will do the whole thing. Already we are getting drones to do the flying over the vineyards, which can tell you which vines need water or treating,” said Joseph, who is a partner at le Grand Noir wines in France.“Machines will do a lot of the judging (wine tasting). They can judge between an OK wine and a not-so-Ok wine pretty effectively,” he said, adding that there would still be scope for human discernment.But wine critics, he said, would be more and more redundant with peer reviews replacing the formal art of wine criticism.“We are going to see different kinds of wines, like fruit-flavoured wines; you will see a lot more wine cocktails. You are going to see packaging changes. Bottles don’t need to be 75 centiliters big. That is the size, because it was the lung capacity of the French glass-blower 300 years ago. There’s no God who defined the size. We are going to see wines in single serves and big bottles,” he said.Joseph also marked out climate change as one of the key challenges for the wine industry, with alterations in weather patterns even possibly threatening the holy turf of wine-making — France and Italy.“It’s going to be very, very interesting and potentially going to be challenging. In established regions like Bordeaux, Burgundy and Loire, it is questionable whether they are going to be growing the same grapes. That’s a really big question and there is some experimentation going on, but not enough,” he said.Wines from the popular French regions, he said, are already tasting different. “Grapes are much riper than they used to be. But it’s just not about warming. That means there are going to be places which are going to be warmer, which are not warmer. English wines are starting to benefit already, maybe, Iceland, who knows? That’s a dramatic change. We will see more vineyards going into the hills in lots of places, which includes India,” he said.',real
'It takes some convincing to make Sabi Giri answer that phone. Several WhatsApp messages go unanswered. A scheduled meeting in Delhi is cancelled at the last minute and a Skype conversation is denied (“I don’t want to be seen like this”). One would have tempted to use the word difficult if it were not for the 25-year-old’s predicament: she is fighting a court battle to be reinstated in her job. On October 5, Sabi was discharged by the navy after she underwent a gender reassignment surgery.The Indian navy restricts the recruitment of women to certain departments. Sabi was serving in a position reserved for men, that of a naval sailor. In its response to Sabi’s petition, the Indian navy said that the existing rules of the navy do not allow Sabi’s “continued employment”. “The serving sailor … chose to undergo irreversible gender re-assignment on his own accord whilst on leave wilfully altering his gender status from the one he was recruited for at the time of his induction. He has therefore breached the Recruitment Regulations and eligibility criteria for his employment as a sailor in the Indian navy,” was the Press Information Bureau’s (Defence Wing) official response to the press. On October 31, the Delhi High Court asked the navy to consider giving Sabi a clerical post. Born into a middle-class family in Chapra, Bihar, young Manish was the only teenager in class without a love interest. “All my friends had girlfriends and boyfriends. I was the odd one out. My mother was very proud that her son had no bad habits,” says Sabi. He knew he was not like the other children. He told himself he was the studious sort and lived with it. “In college, I was bullied a bit. Boys of that age are quite ruthless. I had a hard time there,” she says. In 2010, Sabi joined the navy; she was 18. “It was a moment of great pride for my family. A boy in the sena elevates the family’s status in our part of the word,” says Sabi.After she completed her training, she was posted at INS Ganga in Mumbai in 2011. “That’s where life took a different turn,” says Sabi. “For the first time in my life, I felt emptiness. It was not so much unhappiness as much as this gnawing feeling of losing out,” says Sabi. Her need to seek out people from the queer community was a “way to fill in the loneliness.” “I didn’t even have the vocabulary to define my feelings. Now, I knew there were other people like me,” she said.In her second year in Mumbai, she decided to stay with her friends for about 20 days, without informing her officer in charge. “I wanted to be free for that time. You don’t know how it feels to rehearse each sentence before actually speaking it. I used to do it so that I didn’t sound too effeminate. It’s like being in a prison,” she says. As a punishment, Sabi alleges she was sent into “detention” for about three weeks. “I was not allowed to wear anything but my undergarments. I was locked into a cell and could only go out to relieve myself. Those 20-odd days broke me in many ways,” says Sabi.Eventually, Sabi was transferred to the Visakhapatnam base. By this time, she had a sound network of friends from the queer community. That was also the time she reached out to the navy doctors. “I told them about the difficulties I was having. I told them that I could no longer identify myself as a man. They referred me for counseling,” says Sabi.The counseling sessions would last about an hour where she says she would be advised to take these things “in her stride”, she says. Last year, a private psychiatrist and psychologist in Visakhapatnam diagnosed her with gender identity disorder. “I took a decision to go through a sex reassignment surgery,” says Sabi. The procedure was completed in Delhi last year. “I rushed back to Vizag because I had exhausted my leave,” says Sabi. The healing period of these procedures at times extend to months. “Within days of returning, I acquired a urinary tract infection. I was scared and I didn’t know who to confide in,” says Sabi.When the navy doctors got to know about her surgery, they allegedly transferred her to the psychiatric ward as soon her infection was cured. “For six months, I was kept in the psychiatric ward, with two men keeping watch 24X7,” she says. After she was released from the psychiatric ward in 2017, Sabi reported for work. But she was slapped with a showcause notice for her service record. “They highlighted my past leave of absence. But the thing is: I was duly punished for all that,” says Sabi.',real
'From styling with chic belts to wearing them in dhoti style, Shilpa Shetty has always been able to give a new meaning to a sari. And this time too, she did not disappoint us when she stepped out in a silk sari from the house of Urvashi Kaur.Pairing it with trousers and a shirt, the actor combined separates with six yards, calling it a ‘work sari’. Though we like the concept of comfort fashion, we think stylist Mohit Rai went a little overboard with colours. The multitude of stripes and mismatching colours were a little confusing and we think the plain grey trousers and gold pallu awkwardly stood out, without really blending in.For the accessories, Shetty chose a pair of silver hoops with tassels by Suhani Pittie and sandals from Aprajta Toor rounded off her look nicely.

'Theeran Adhigaram Ondru movie cast: Karthi, Rakul Preet Singh, Abhimanyu Singh, Bose Venkat\r\nTheeran Adhigaram Ondru movie director: H Vinoth\r\nTheeran Adhigaram Ondru movie rating: 3 starsWhen I met Director H Vinoth before Theeran Adhigaram Ondru’s release, he told me that the film would be a new experience if we forgive a few clichés. That is exactly how the movie turned out to be. A high-paced action flick, Theeran Adhigaram Ondru walks the talk in all aspects well aided by Ghibran’s music.The breakneck pace that the film maintains (for the most part) helps us battle the film’s major grouse, it’s running time. Deep into the second half, we can empathise with Karthi’s frustration; we are as annoyed as he is about not being able to nab the gang. But, the well-orchestrated action sequences keep you hooked. We barely see any walking on-screen; even the jeeps and buses ply in fast-forward. There is so much happening that you don’t feel the need to look away or have the space to do so.My conversation with Vinoth kept resurfacing as I watched Theeran Adhigaram Ondru; I was happy that he delivered what he promised. A story about an honest cop, there is a constant reminder about the imperfect mechanism they have to function within. However, there is minimal preaching. Rather, the disappointment is mired in sarcasm. The elements of a regular police story do make an appearance: the cop who always has an easy way out, lack of funds, the references to bribery etc. However, there is no disillusionment in Theeran’s case. He knows what he is up against. Why complain? Karthi delivers a neat performance as Theeran, pulling off the action sequences with elan.The cut to the flashback, or the actual story, is probably the weakest link in Theeran Adhigaram Ondru. A phone call from a younger officer about the most difficult case he had ever handled sets Theeran’s mind in motion, recalling the past. Instead of a cut there, if we could have seen Theeran walking down the memory lane after the phone call, the end would have felt more cohesive. And, going by the low standards set for heroines in commercial films, I was happy Rakul Preet Singh had a role to play, even if it is minor. Yet another take on the ‘loose ponnu’ who Tamil cinema knows very well, their romance doesn’t hinder the story much. But the tangible collective sigh that rose from the audience when the narrative cuts back to romance, gives me hope that this trend would change. Maybe soon, directors would not have to include a love story just for the sake of it.',real
'American novelist, essayist and critic Francine Prose, who is in Mumbai to attend the Tata Literature Live!, has never shied away from taking the nuanced, if difficult, position in a debate. In 2015, she was one of the writers who objected to PEN giving the Freedom of Expression Courage Award to Charlie Hebdo, the French satirical magazine which she said “drew crude caricatures” and “mocked at religion”. More recently, she had drawn flak for an article that takes on social media activism against “cultural appropriation”. In a phone interview to Indian Express , Prose spoke about the divisions that are driving Americans apart and what, in these circumstances, gives her hopeOne of your most well-known books, ‘Lovers at the Chameleon Club, Paris 1932’ fictionalises a certain period in history. How do you maintain the balance between fact and fiction in a novel?Of course, I had to do a lot of research. You have to do that even if you’re writing a novel, because you don’t want to have the sort of mistake that will throw the reader out of the novel. For example, having the Berlin Olympics happen in a different year than they did. So I wanted to get those things right. It is also one of the advantages of writing a novel that you are not constrained by certain things about history. I have no idea what the dinner before the Olympics opened was like, but I was able to imagine it. So much of the novel is also about whether different people’s version of history is accurate or not. So that was part of what I was thinking as well.In the novel, we hear from many people, including Picasso as well as Gabor Tsenyi, the fictional photographer modelled on Brassai, and Baroness Lily de Rossignol, based on Peggy Guggenheim. Why do we never hear directly from the central character, Lou Villars?Some of it was just practical. I couldn’t do it. I kept trying and it didn’t work. It just didn’t sound right. But also, one of the things I realised I was writing about was the mystery of evil. I wanted it to stay a mystery. It seemed to me to write from her point of view would necessarily diminish that mystery.Your bestselling book till date is ‘Reading like a Writer’. What prompted you to write it?Two things. One was that it became clear to me that students wanted to be writers without reading. I was once talking to graduate students in writing and they had never read Dostoevsky, and I said, how is this possible. But also, many of the chapters in that book were based on lectures I had given at various conferences so I just decided to put them together.You’ve written over 30 books so far, besides teaching and writing articles and essays. Are you a fast writer?I am now. Not fiction, really. I’m not a fast writer of fiction, but essays, especially since the election. I have been doing a lot of political journalism for the Guardian and I have been writing a lot for the New York Review of Books, and I have learnt to do those pieces fairly quickly, by necessity sometimes, because when the Guardian asks me to write, it’s about something that has just happened and they and I don’t have the luxury of my waiting two weeks to think through an idea. It’s the way things are happening now, so quickly, so I have to really respond really rapidly.In one of your articles, you called for a “general strike” against the new US government. That’s not happened, of course, but do you think there’s still resistance?I think that’s a very complicated question. The way things are, the way they have been normalised, people can’t be demonstrating on the streets every day of their lives. It’s just not possible. There’s tremendous resistance, but I think there’s also a feeling of hoping that the various investigations will turn up something and our government will finally do the right thing because of the idea that private citizens with placards on the streets will be listened to – I don’t think anyone really believes that anymore.What gives you hope for these times?I teach a literature class at Bard, and my students are so alert and so alive and so looking for some way to solve this incredible problem, the situation we are in. Honestly, the only times I feel hopeful are when I come out of class on Friday afternoons and I think that OK, it is possible that this generation will be able to deal with this.A recent study by the Pew Centre says that this is the most divided that the USA has been since the Civil War. Do you agree?It’s terrible. It’s really a terrible moment in our history. The fact that we have a government trying to increase this division rather than close it, is not helping, believe me. But there’s a terrible division. For example, when you publish an article or put something online, the comments page is just people raging at each other. No one seems to be looking for common ground or in a way. Every piece that I write for one of these papers, I manage to put in just some line saying that it’s not helpful to have this kind of anger across party lines, across cultural and social divides and no one seems to read that. They read the headline and then they start typing. There’s a lot of displacement going on. That is, people who have no idea anymore what to do about our government, and they take out their anger on soft targets.You’re not afraid to take the difficult position, like when you protested against the award for Charlie Hebdo. How do you feel now about the controversy?',real
'A meeting of the city corporation council on Saturday ended in scuffle between members of the ruling CPM and Opposition BJP. Mayor and CPM leader V K Prasanth was injured in the melee and hospitalised. The meeting was held to mark the present council’s two years in office.Trouble started with the BJP moving a resolution in the council questioning a ban on setting up high-mast lights at junctions with local area development funds of legislators. The BJP wanted the circular, banning the use of MP/MLA funds, to be withdrawn.The mayor pointed out that it was illegal on the part of the opposition to demand withdrawal of the circular, which temporarily banned construction of high-mast lights. When the mayor left his chamber after completing other proceedings in the council hall, BJP councillors reportedly manhandled him. He was pulled down allegedly by BJP councillors when he was going up the stairs.Prasanth was admitted to an intensive care unit of a medical college hospital.

'TOKYO: Non-smoking employees at one Japanese firm are getting six additional days\' holiday to compensate for the time their colleagues spend puffing away at work. Piala, a Tokyo-based online commerce consulting and marketing company, kicked off the programme in September after an employee complained about the time lost by smoking colleagues who frequently disappear to light up. \"Because our office is located on the 29th floor ... it takes at least 10 minutes for a smoker to go down to a common smoking room in the basement and come back,\" spokesman Hirotaka Matsushima told AFP. \"But at the same time, it\'s true that smoking room conversations are mostly about work ... they exchange ideas and consult each other,\" he said. \"So we decided it\'s better to give rewards (to non-smokers) than punish the smokers,\" added Matsushima. Since the start of the programme on September 1, four employees out of 42 smokers have kicked the habit. There are 120 people employed in total at the firm. \"If they successfully keep their promise over the year, they\'ll be given six extra days of paid leave,\" he said. Japan lags behind other developed nations in terms of smoke-free policies and the social pressure to quit is less intense. Unlike many western countries, smoking is permitted in certain sections of restaurants. Even so, most companies in Japan have banned smoking in the workplace and set up smoking rooms and tobacco use has been falling, in line with a broader global trend. According to health ministry data, some 28 percent of men smoke in Japan and nine percent of women.

'It’s an effort that attempts to bring closer to the residents of Chandigarh, the work, vision and genius of Swiss architect Pierre Jeanneret, who collaborated with his cousin, Le Corbusier, for about 20 years in realising the urban fabric of India’s first planned modern city. The first chief architect of the city, Jeanneret made Chandigarh his home and work place, carefully monitoring and supervising the city’s construction on a day-to-day basis.On Jeanneret’s 50th death anniversary (March 22, 1896 – December 4, 1967), the Chandigarh College of Architecture is organising a symposium ‘Pierre Jeanneret, The Foot Architect of Chandigarh’ (December 3 and 4) to commemorate his legacy, designing a series of events that will be open to the public.The philosophy of the symposium being to get the citizens of Chandigarh closer to the history of the city, the work of Jeanneret and also involve them in the preservation of the city and its unique architecture.“We want the people of Chandigarh to participate and be involved in the event, and that is why we have worked on ideas that will appeal to a larger audience, and at the same time, introduce them to the legacy and work of Jeanneret,” said Sangeeta Bagga Mehta, principal of the college.The symposium will begin with guided tours by students and faculty of CCA to the Capitol Complex, Pierre Jeanneret Museum; Old architect’s office (Le Corbusier Centre) and key buildings of the Panjab University. “As part of the tour, people can go up to the terraces of some of the buildings of PU and also the housing here, and photograph the spectacular views. The entire college, both students and faculty are involved in every aspect of the effort,” adds Mehta.Jeanneret was responsible for designing iconic buildings such as the Gandhi Bhawan and the University Library at Panjab University, MLA Hostels in Sector 3 and 4, Polytechnic for Men (now CCET) in Sector 26, the State Library, Town Hall and the General Post Office Building in Sector 17, the Architects’ Office (now Le Corbusier Centre) in Sector 19, the PGIMER in Sector 12.Jeanneret also designed furniture, both independently and with Charlotte Perriand, experimenting with minimalist design, green architecture and spaces that were energy efficient.The symposium will also include an exhibition of photographs of the buildings of PU designed by Jeanneret, as well as a showcase of drawings, maps, and archival material in collaboration with the Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal.The keynote lecture, ‘Remembering Pierre Jeanneret: Celebrating the Power of the Ordinary’ will be delivered by Professor Kiran Joshi, who has written a book on Jeanneret, with architects Jit Malhotra and SD Sharma, who worked with Jeanneret, being honoured on the occasion.The second day, December 4, will be dedicated to panel sessions by prominent academicians and practising architects .The detailed programme is attached. On December 4 will be a panel discussion on ‘Architectural Practices that carry forth the heritage of Pierre Jeanneret’, as academicians from across the country get together for a discourse on how to teach modern architecture and also conserve the heritage ensembles of Jeanneret.',real
'TOKYO: Japanese police have found nine bodies, including two with their heads severed and dumped in a cool box, in a flat in the Tokyo suburbs, media reported on Tuesday. Police confirmed to AFP they had arrested 27-year-old Takahiro Shiraishi, who lives in the apartment in Zama, south of Tokyo. According to public broadcaster NHK, Shiraishi told police: \"I killed them and did some work on the bodies in order to hide the evidence.\" Jiji Press said Shiraishi had told police that he chopped up the bodies in a bathroom and a saw was found in his room. The bodies were of eight women and one man, several media reported. A police spokesman could not immediately confirm these reports. According to Jiji Press, police found the two heads inside a cool box at the entrance of the apartment before making the grisly discovery of the other bodies. Police found the other bodies in a number of large boxes in the apartment, reports said. Authorities had been investigating the disappearance of a 23-year-old woman and discovered a connection between her and Shiraishi. This woman had earlier tweeted \"I\'m looking for someone to die with me,\" according to the Sankei Shimbun daily. Other media said Shiraishi and the woman had connected via a website featuring information about suicides. Television pictures showed a heavy police presence blocking off a nondescript white-tiled terraced apartment. CCTV captured Shiraishi and the 23-year-old woman walking together last Monday. She had been missing since September 21 and her older brother called in her disappearance to police on Tuesday, the Asahi Shimbun reported.

'NEW DELHI. Former Australian cricketer Tom Moody had a humorous reaction to being mistaken for ratings agency Moody\'s Investors Service.

'The Union Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment has decided to junk the recommendations of a parliamentary committee report which was the first ever government document to recognise the rights of transgender persons to partnerships and marriage, so that they were no longer criminalised under IPC Section 377, apart from offering other rights.The ministry is set to re-introduce its original version of The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, in the next session of Parliament. The Standing Committee on Social Justice and Empowerment, comprising 18 Lok Sabha members and headed by BJP MP Ramesh Bais, tabled its report on the floor of the House in July 2017. The report recommended specific provisions in the ministry’s version of the transgender Bill, to safeguard their rights, protect them against discrimination, and provide quotas in government colleges and jobs.On whether the recommendations of the panel would be included in a revised version of the Bill, Social Justice Minister Thawaar Chand Gehlot told The Sunday Express, “We will be forwarding our original Bill as it is. Our ministry feels that the Bill made by us is good and there is no need to change it.” Gehlot added that the ministry will try to place the Bill in the Winter Session of Parliament. “It depends on the Parliamentary Affairs Ministry whether to include it in their business. We will try that it comes before this session,” he said.The parliamentary panel report, hailed as progressive by many within the community, had faulted the government’s Bill for its failure to address several crucial issues. Noting that “Transgender persons remain at risk of criminalisation under Section 377”, it asked that the Bill must recognise their civil rights such as marriage, divorce, adoption, whether under personal or secular laws.While the August 2017 Supreme Court nine-judge bench Right to Privacy judgment had made strong observations on the need to decriminalise IPC Section 377 (which currently penalises sexual intercourse “against the order of nature”), the matter is still pending consideration before the apex court in a separate case.The panel’s recommendation was meant to accord legal recognition and protection from Section 377 to, if not all sexual minorities, at least transgender persons whose welfare comes under the Social Justice Ministry. In April 2016, DMK MP Tiruchi Siva’s Bill on transgender rights had become the first private member’s Bill to be passed by the House in 45 years. It was after the passage of his Bill in the Rajya Sabha that the government said that it would table its own version of the Bill, which it did in the Lower House in August 2016. Unlike the private member Bill, the ministry’s Bill had several omissions, including reservations in jobs and education (a Supreme Court directive).The parliamentary panel, set up to study the Bill, asked for reservations, strong provisions against discrimination, penalties on government officials who subject transgender persons to any kind of violence, skill training to wean them off begging, and separate public toilets for them.Going beyond rights and welfare, the panel report also addressed the issue of sexual identity. It asked for provisions that provide “penal action against abortions of intersex foetuses and forced surgical assignment of sex of intersex infants.” Most importantly, it redefined several terms in the Bill. To recognise alternative family structures such as adoptions of transgender children by the the Hijra or Aravani communities, it defined family in the Bill as “a group of people related by blood, marriage or by adoption of a transgender person”.The ministry’s proposed definition of transgender persons as ‘neither wholly male or female, a combination of female or male, neither female nor male” was criticised by the panel as “primitive and based on the underlying assumption of biological determinism” and hence, it said, it should simply be “one whose gender does not match with the gender assigned to that person at birth”.',real
'As per an ‘idf.org’ report, diabetes took the life of at least a million people in 2013. The number of diabetes cases in India skyrocketed to more than 65 million in 2013 and as a result, the overall cost of treatment increased as well. International Diabetes Federation, in a 2012 report, stated that the number of cases in India is going to cross the 100 million mark by 2030. From these reports, one thing is certain – diabetes is one of the biggest killers in India.Because it is a chronic disease, controlling diabetes requires a lot of money. In addition to hospitalization and treatment, the patient has to undergo regular tests and check-ups. This can easily put a dampener on the household budget of the patient. Studies in India have found out that if there is one patient in a low-income Indian household, around 20\% of the family income may be devoted to their care.Early diagnosis can still benefit a patient in some ways, but if someone has a long-standing undiagnosed diabetes, the cost of treatment drastically increases. According to an ‘idf’ report, “global health spending to treat diabetes and manage complications totaled at least $ 548 billion (US) in 2013.” People in countries like India have to pay more for the treatment owing to lack of medical services and limited access to health insurance. The same report suggests in 2013, the economic burden of diabetes could’ve been around Rs. 30,000 Crore! The numbers are staggeringly high, and to some extent, the patients themselves are responsible.A lot of people refrain from buying insurance early on in their life and feel the brunt of it at an older age. That is why it is crucial to have a separate emergency fund. At the very least, insurance gives you mental peace. Choosing the right insurance provider is of equal importance. An insurance plan that is solely centered around chronic diseases would benefit a diabetic more than a generic insurance plan.Activ Health by Aditya Birla Health Insurance is one plan that comes equipped with an inbuilt Chronic Management Program tailor-made keeping chronic diseases in focus. It is unique because the plan covers you from day one i.e. as soon as you have bought the plan, or are diagnosed with diabetes during the policy term. Specifically designed for people with chronic conditions like Diabetes, Asthma, High Blood Pressure and High Cholesterol, the program aims to help them on their journey to good health.',real
'TOKYO: With a round of golf, a custom cap and a hamburger of American beef, President Donald Trump\'s first trip to Asia began with a taste of home. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe welcomed Trump to Japan Sunday with an effusive display of friendship that, in the days ahead, will give way to high-stakes diplomacy. The two leaders, who have struck up an unlikely but easy rapport, shared a casual lunch and played nine holes at the Kasumigaseki Country Club, joined by professional golfer Hideki Matsuyama. The low-key agenda was a prelude to the formal talks, a press conference and state dinner planned in Tokyo on Monday. Abe will be looking for a united front against North Korea and reassurances that the US will stand by its treaty obligations to defend Japan if attacked. Eager to forge a bond with Tokyo\'s crucial ally, Abe was one of the first world leaders to court President-elect Trump. He was the first to call Trump after the election, and rushed to New York days later to meet the president-elect and present him with a pricey, gold Honma golf driver. The two men also met on the sidelines of an international summit in Italy this spring and Trump hosted Abe in Florida. White House officials said Trump has spoken with Abe by phone more than any world leader, aside from British Prime Minister Theresa May. That bond was clear on Sunday. \"The relationship is really extraordinary. We like each other and our countries like each other,\" Trump said Sunday night before dinner with Abe, who for this meal did show Trump traditional cuisine with a teppanyaki dinner. \"And I don\'t think we\'ve ever been closer to Japan than we are right now.\" Trump and Abe also exchanged glowing tweets about their golf. Trump dubbed Abe and Matsuyama \"wonderful people,\" while Abe called it a \"round of golf with a marvelous friend.\" Abe told reporters after the golf session that the two could talk frankly in a relaxed atmosphere while out on the course. He said they were able to \"carry out in depth discussion, at times touching on various difficult issues.\" A senior White House official, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity, said the pair had discussed trade and North Korea _ but didn\'t keep score. From the time Marine One landed on the Kasumigaseki Country Club\'s driving range, Abe rolled out little touches to make Trump feel welcome. He presented a hat that had a version of Trump\'s campaign theme, this time reading \"Donald and Shinzo: Make Alliance Even Greater.\" The two passed up the region\'s famed Kobe beef in favor of the American version, which is favored by Trump, a famed picky eater. When Trump hosted Abe in Palm Beach earlier this year, they played at one of Trump\'s Florida golf courses. For that outing, Trump brought along pro golfer Ernie Els, so this time Abe matched him by bringing along Matsuyama, whom Trump described on the plane ride to Asia as \"probably the greatest player in the history of Japan.\" Abe was behind the wheel of a golf cart as the two men were spotted moving from hole to hole, Trump in the passenger seat smiling and waving at those they passed. \"From the point of view of Abe administration, the personal chemistry that exists between the two leaders is seen as an asset,\" said Mireya Sollis, chair in Japan Studies for the Brookings Center for East Asia Policy Studies. She said that the Japanese believe it is already \"seeing it pay off,\" including when Trump agreed to meet with the families of Japanese citizens kidnapped by the North Korean regime, an important issue for Tokyo. Ever since Saudi Arabia delivered a lavish welcome on Trump\'s first international trip, leaders have tried to outdo themselves to impress the president, who has proven susceptible to flattery. Before the game, Trump delivered a speech in which he hailed Japan as a \"crucial ally\" and warned adversaries not to test America\'s resolve. \"Japan is a treasured partner and crucial ally of the United States and today we thank them for welcoming us and for decades of wonderful friendship between our two nations,\" Trump told American and Japanese service members at Yokota Air Base on the outskirts of Tokyo. Though Trump did not mention North Korea by name during the speech, the spectre of its weapons program will loom large throughout Trump\'s five-nation Asia trip. The president warned of the consequences of crossing what he called the \"most fearsome fighting force in the history of our world.\" \"Together with our allies, America\'s warriors are prepared to defend our nation using the full range of our unmatched capabilities. No one _ no dictator, no regime and no nation _ should underestimate, ever, American resolve,\" he told the troops. And while there is worry in the region about Trump\'s unpredictable response to the threat posed by Kim Jong Un, Trump made clear he did not intend to tone down his bellicose rhetoric _ including dubbing Kim Jong Un as \"Little Rocket Man\" _ even while in an Asian capital within reach of the North Korea dictator\'s missiles. \"There\'s been 25 years of total weakness, so we are taking a very much different approach,\" he said, speaking to reporters on Air Force One. Trump will also meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of an upcoming summit in Vietnam. The easy rapport with Japan could be strained if Trump takes an aggressive approach on trade or the two men disagree on how best to approach the threat looming in Pyongyang. During his campaign, Trump suggested Japan should acquire its own nuclear weapons to defend itself, hinted the US might not come to the nation\'s defense, and accused Japan of \"killing us\" on trade. He has dropped that antagonist language almost entirely since the election, but tensions remain. Scott Seaman, a director for Asia of the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultant organization, noted: \"everything is fine with Trump until you tell him no. So far, Abe hasn\'t told him no.\" Get latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.',real

'FUSSA, Japan: President Donald Trump praised Japan as a \"treasured partner\" and \"crucial ally\" Sunday, as he kicked off a grueling and consequential first trip to Asia. Trump landed at Yokota Air Base on the outskirts of Tokyo, where he was greeted by cheers from service members. Trump then donned a bomber jacket for a speech in which he touted American firepower and the U.S. alliance with Japan. \"Japan is a treasured partner and crucial ally of the United States and today we thank them for welcoming us and for decades of wonderful friendship between our two nations,\" he said, speaking in front of an American flag inside an airplane hangar. \"On behalf of the United States of America, I send the warmest wishes of the America people to the citizens of this remarkable country,\" he said. After the speech, Trump was set to head to a private golf course for an informal lunch and golf with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Trump was expected to exhort allies and rivals to step up efforts to counter the dangers posed by North Korea\'s nuclear threat. Before he landed, Trump used the first moments of his trip to denounce North Korea as \"a big problem\" that must \"be solved.\" \"There\'s been 25 years of total weakness, so we are taking a very much different approach\" in dealing with the renegade regime in Pyongyang,\" he said, speaking to reporters on Air Force One. Some regional analysts have speculated that Trump\'s presence in Asia may prompt North Korea to take provocative action, like a missile test. Trump, when asked about that possibility, said \"we\'ll soon find out.\" The 12-day, five-country trip, the longest Far East itinerary for a president in a generation, comes at a precarious moment for Trump. Just days ago, his former campaign chairman was indicted and another adviser pleaded guilty as part of an investigation into possible collusion between his 2016 campaign and Russian officials. It will pose a test for Trump\'s stamina _ but Trump assured reporters aboard Air Force that he was up for the task. \"It\'s grueling, they tell me, but fortunately that\'s historically not been a problem for me. One thing you people will say, that\'s not been a problem,\" he said. It also presents a crucial international test for a president looking to reassure Asian allies worried that his inward-looking \"America First\" agenda could cede power in the region to China. They also are rattled by his bellicose rhetoric about North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The North\'s growing missile arsenal threatens the capitals Trump will visit. \"The trip comes, I would argue, at a very inopportune time for the president. He is under growing domestic vulnerabilities that we all know about, hour to hour,\" said Jonathan Pollack, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. \"The conjunction of those issues leads to the palpable sense of unease about the potential crisis in Korea.\" Trump\'s spontaneous, and at time reckless, style flies in the face of the generations-old traditions and protocol that govern diplomatic exchanges in Asia. The grand receptions expected for him in Tokyo, Seoul, Beijing and beyond are sure to be lavish attempts to impress the president, who raved about the extravagances shown him on earlier visits to Saudi Arabia and France. The trip will also put Trump in face-to-face meetings with authoritarian leaders for whom he has expressed admiration. They include China\'s Xi Jinping, whom Trump has likened to \"a king,\" and the Philippines\' Rodrigo Duterte, who has sanctioned the extrajudicial killings of drug dealers. Trump is also expected to have a second private audience with Russian President Vladimir Putin, on the sidelines of a summit in Vietnam. He told reporters that the meeting is \"expected\" to happen and that he \"will want Putin\'s help\" in dealing with the North Korea nuclear crisis. Trump and Putin could cross paths twice during the president\'s lengthy Asia trip: at a summit in Vietnam and later in the Philippines. It was unclear where they would meet. Trump and Putin previously met along the sidelines of a summit in Europe this summer. The White House is signaling that Trump will push American economic interests in the region, but the North Korean threat is expected to dominate the trip. One of Trump\'s two major speeches will come before the National Assembly in Seoul. Fiery threats against the North could resonate differently than they do from the distance of Washington. Trump will forgo a trip to the Demilitarized Zone, the stark border between North and South Korea. All US presidents except one since Ronald Reagan have visited the DMZ in a sign of solidarity with Seoul. The White House contends that Trump\'s commitment to South Korea is already crystal clear, as evidenced by his war of words with Kim and his threats to deliver \"fire and fury\" to North Korea if it does not stop threatening American allies. The escalation of rhetoric, a departure from the conduct of past presidents, has undermined confidence in the US as a stabilizing presence in Asia. \"There\'s a danger if there is a lot of muscle flexing,\" said Mike Chinoy, a senior fellow at the US-China Institute at the University of Southern California. \"Trump has been going right up to the edge and I wouldn\'t rule out some sort of forceful North Korean reaction to Trump\'s presence in the region,\" he said. The White House said Trump would be undeterred. \"The president will use whatever language he wants to use, obviously. That\'s been of great reassurance to our allies, partners and others in the region who are literally under the gun of this regime,\" White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster said Thursday. \"I don\'t think the president really modulates his language, have you noticed?\" At each stop, Trump will urge his hosts to squeeze North Korea by stopping trading with the North and sending home North Korean citizens working abroad. That includes China, which competes with the U.S. for influence in the region and provides much of North Korea\'s economic lifeblood. The White House is banking on the close relationships Trump has established with some Asian leaders to help make his demands more palatable. Officials acknowledge that Trump does not yet have a feel for Moon Jae-in, South Korea\'s newly elected liberal president. But Trump has demonstrated cordial relations with Xi and has struck up a friendship with Abe. While Xi and Abe have recently tightened their control on power, Trump arrives weakened by low poll numbers, a stalled domestic agenda and the swirling Russia probe. But Trump told reporters that he and Xi, now believed to be China\'s strongest leader in decades, will go into their meetings on equal footing. \"Excuse me, so am I,\" he said, pointing to the stock market, which has been hitting record highs, and other economic indicators, as evidence of his own power. \"We are coming off some of the strongest numbers we have ever had and he knows that and he respects that and he\'s a friend of mine,\" Trump said. \"I think he is viewing us as very, very strong.\'\' Get latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.',real
'TOKYO: US President Donald Trump greeted Japanese Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko on Monday with a genteel handshake and nod, but no bow, avoiding the pitfall of US President Barack Obama who was criticized at home for his deep bow to the monarch. Trump, wearing a suit and tie and his wife, Melania, in a long, dark blue dress, were met at the palace entrance by the royal couple, who were both wearing suits. Trump smiled, shook hands and nodded at the 83-year-old emperor before greeting Michiko as well. The four entered the palace where they chatted through interpreters in footage aired live on television, but without sound as is customary. After the meeting, Trump shook hands again, and tapped the emperor\'s arm repeatedly with his left hand. \"Thank you for the great meeting\", he told Akihito. \"I\'m sure we will meet again\". Obama came under fire after meeting the emperor in Tokyo in 2009 for what his critics back home said was bowing too low to Akihito. Some U.S. commentators said the U.S. president should not lower his head before foreign monarchs. Akihito has spent much of his reign working to heal the wounds of World War II, which was waged across Asia in his father\'s name, Emperor Hirohito. Obama also faced criticism from a different quarter - etiquette experts - who noted he combined a bow with an handshake, which is not done in Japan traditionally, whether meeting the emperor or anyone else. Barack Obama greeted by Emperor Akihito at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo on November 14, 2009. (Reuters File Photo) Japanese guests are not supposed to touch the royal couple or shake hands, but foreign guests often do. Hillary Clinton shook hands and air-kissed the empress on both cheeks, then took her hand as they entered the palace when she met the royal pair as secretary of state in 2011, a month or so after the triple disasters of an earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown hit northeastern Japan in March of that year. Traditionalists say that Japan\'s Chrysanthemum throne dates back more than 2,000 years. Akihito was the first royal heir in the Japanese imperial family to marry a commoner -- a symbol of Japan\'s new modernity and confidence. Japan earlier this year enacted a law clearing the way for Akihito, to step down, clearing the way for the first abdication by a Japanese monarch in nearly two centuries and the accession of his son, Crown Prince Naruhito in late 2018 early 2019. Akihito\'s father, Emperor Hirohito, was considered divine until after Japan\'s defeat in World War Two. The current emperor is defined by the constitution as a symbol of the people, and has no political authority although he is widely respected.

'TOKYO: President Donald Trump appeared to strike a more conciliatory tone on North Korea as he got down to business today on an Asian tour that will be dominated by the nuclear crisis with Pyongyang. Trump began his marathon trip in belligerent form, warning yesterday that \"no dictator\" should underestimate US resolve, a clear swipe at North Korea and its young leader Kim Jong-Un. However he then appeared to open the door for talks with Pyongyang, saying in an interview broadcast on US TV that he would \"certainly be open\" to meeting Kim. \"I would sit down with anybody,\" he said. \"I don\'t think it\'s strength or weakness, I think sitting down with people is not a bad thing,\" he said on the \"Full Measure\" show. \"So I would certainly be open to doing that but we\'ll see where it goes, I think we\'re far too early.\" The president arrived in Asia with tensions over North Korea at fever pitch, as US bombers fly sorties over the Korean peninsula and concerns mount that Pyongyang might stage another nuclear or missile test. Hawkish Abe and Trump are closely allied on the North Korea issue, with the Japanese prime minister sticking firmly to the US line that \"all options\" are on the table to deal with the rogue state. \"The closeness of the relationship is unprecedented. And the degree to which US and Japanese strategies are aligned, both on the Korean Peninsula but also throughout the Indo- Pacific, is also unprecedented,\" a senior Trump administration official said yesterday. That closeness was demonstrated on the first day, when the two golfing buddies hit the course within hours of Trump touching down on Japanese soil. Both leaders later tweeted images of their nine-hole encounter, with Abe saying the \"relaxed\" nature of their game allowed them to have \"candid\" discussions on some \"difficult\" issues. However, that did not stop Trump lashing out at the trade relationship with Japan today, saying it had been \"winning\" for decades at the expense of the United States. \"We want fair and open trade but right now our trade with Japan is not fair and open,\" Trump told business leaders. \"The US has suffered massive trade deficits with Japan for many, many years. So we will have to negotiate and we will do this in a friendly way.\" Trump will today meet families of civilians kidnapped by North Korea to train their agents in Japanese culture and language — an emotional issue that still angers Tokyo. North Korea has admitted to kidnapping 13 Japanese civilians but Japan believes the regime took dozens more, including a 13-year-old girl abducted on her way home from school. \"You are going to see some focus on the often overlooked question of human rights conditions in NK,\" said the White House official. Trump stressed US military power and resolve while wearing a bomber jacket in front of service personnel when he landed in Japan, but speaking to reporters on the plane, he reserved some warm words for the North Korean people. \"I think they\'re great people. They\'re industrious. They\'re warm, much warmer than the world really knows or understands. They\'re great people. And I hope it all works out for everybody,\" he said. However, he described North Korea as \"a big problem for our country and for our world and we want to get it solved\". Trump also announced that he would hold talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin during his trip, as the global community scrambles for a solution to the North Korean crisis. \"We want Putin\'s help on North Korea,\" he said. After meeting the Emperor and Empress of Japan, Trump holds talks with the prime minister and will brief the media before a final banquet with his \"friend\" Abe. But Trump\'s Asian tour is set to become more testing as he flies to South Korea, then on to China. Trump has a cooler relationship with South Korean President Moon Jae-In, whose dovish approach to the crisis he has denounced as \"appeasement\". The president will address the parliament in Seoul but will not visit the Demilitarized Zone dividing the Korean peninsula — a visit derided in Washington as a bit of a \"cliche.\" From Seoul, Trump travels to Beijing to meet his counterpart Xi Jinping who has solidified his grip on power after being handed a second term. Trump\'s high-stakes visit to the region was overshadowed by what the president described as a \"horrific shooting\" in Texas, where a gunman killed at least 26 people and wounded 20 more during Sunday services. \"Our hearts are broken,\" he told business tycoons in Tokyo.

'MANILA: US President Donald Trump said on Monday he had a \"great relationship\" with his Philippine counterpart, Rodrigo Duterte, while a White House official said human rights got a brief mention when the two met on the sidelines of an Asian summit. Their meeting was one of the most anticipated of the summit of East and Southeast Asian leaders in Manila, with human rights groups pressing Trump to take a tough line on Duterte over his bloody war on drugs, in which thousands of people have been killed. \"We are your ally. We are an important ally,\" Duterte told Trump at the beginning of their talks, according to reporters allowed in to the meeting room. Trump replied: \"We\'ve had a great relationship. This has been very successful. And the ASEAN (Association of South East Asian Nations) conference has been handled beautifully by the president in the Philippines.\" When a reporter asked Trump if he would raise human rights at the meeting, Duterte said: \"Whoa, whoa. This is not a press statement. This is the bilateral meeting.\" A Philippines government spokesman later said human rights were not raised. However, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the topic was mentioned briefly. \"The conversation focused on ISIS (Islamic State), illegal drugs, and trade. Human rights briefly came up in the context of the Philippines\' fight against illegal drugs.\" Duterte, who has spoken highly of Trump, said last week he would tell the U.S. president to \"lay off\" if he were to raise accusations of rights violations. Duterte has been called the \"Trump of the East\" for his brash style and provocative language. Trump was criticised in May for praising Duterte during a phone call for the \"great job\" he was doing to counter illegal narcotics. More than 3,900 people have been killed in a war on drugs that Duterte declared when he took office last year. His government says the police act in self defence, but critics say executions are taking place with no accountability. The United States and the Philippines, a former U.S. colony, have been strategic allies since World War Two. But their relations have been strained by anti-U.S. outbursts from Duterte and his enthusiasm for better ties with Russia and China. However, Duterte clearly appears to be getting on better with Trump than with his predecessor Barack Obama. The two leaders seem to have warmed to each other after meeting for the first time on Saturday at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group\'s meeting in Vietnam. On Sunday, Duterte crooned hit Filipino love song \"Ikaw\" (You) at a gala dinner for summit leaders in Manila, saying it was on \"the orders\" of Trump. One of the song\'s verses, translated from Filipino, begins: \"You are the light in my world, a half of this heart of mine\". \"Ladies and gentlemen, I sang uninvited, upon the orders of the commander-in-chief of the United States,\" Duterte said later, according to the ABS-CBN news channel. Duterte\'s Communications Secretary Martin Andanar told reporters that the two leaders got on well, after a tense relationship between Duterte and Obama. \"The issue between President Duterte and former President Barack Obama is a thing of the past,\" Andanar said. \"They really hit it off.\" Get latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.',real
'MANILA: US President Donald Trump skipped the plenary session of a summit of East and Southeast Asian leaders in Manila on Tuesday because of scheduling delays, but he said his marathon trip to the region had been a success. Trump left for home from the Philippines after a lunch with the other leaders, as meetings were running about two hours behind schedule. He told reporters on Air Force One that he had delivered his prepared remarks during the lunch instead of the summit meeting. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson would attend the plenary session in his place, a senior White House official said. Trump said his trip had resulted in at least $300 billion, possibly triple that figure, of deals being agreed. He did not elaborate. \"We\'ve explained that the United States is open for trade but we want reciprocal, we want fair trade for the United States,\" he said. Trade and concern about possible protectionism under Trump\'s \"America First\" agenda have come up during his visit to the region, which included stops in Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam before concluding in the Philippines. Earlier in the day, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau raised the plight of Rohingya refugees and extra-judicial killings in the Philippines at the summit, sensitive human rights issues skirted by almost all the others. There was no pressure from Trump over the Philippines\' bloody war on drugs during a meeting on Monday with President Rodrigo Duterte on the sidelines of the summit. A joint statement after the meeting said the two sides \"underscored that human rights and the dignity of human life are essential, and agreed to continue mainstreaming the human rights agenda in their national programmes.\" However, Trudeau said that during his conversation with Duterte, he \"mentioned human rights, rule of law and specifically extra-judicial killings as being an issue that Canada is concerned with.\" \"The president was receptive to my comments and it was throughout a very cordial and positive exchange,\" Trudeau told a news conference. More than 3,900 pushers and users have been killed in the war on drugs that Duterte declared when he took office last year. His government says the police act in self-defence, but critics say executions are taking place with no accountability. Duterte cursed Trump\'s predecessor, Barack Obama, last year for raising concerns about the war on drugs and he subsequently declared that he was breaking with the United States, a close ally of the Philippines since World War Two. Trump, by contrast, said on Monday he had a \"great relationship\" with Duterte. ROHINGYA CRISIS Trudeau said he also met Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi and raised the plight of Rohingya refugees, although he did not mention the Muslim minority by name. \"This is a tremendous concern to Canada and to many, many countries around the world,\" he said. The government in mostly-Buddhist Myanmar regards the Rohingya as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and does not recognise the term. Over 600,000 Rohingya have fled to refugee camps in Bangladesh since military clearance operations were launched in response to attacks by Rohingya militants on Aug. 25. The plight of the Rohingya has brought outrage from around the world and there have been calls for democracy champion Suu Kyi to be stripped of the Nobel peace prize she won in 1991 because she has not condemned the military\'s actions. Some countries in the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), particularly Muslim-majority Malaysia, have voiced strong concern over the issue recently. However, in keeping with ASEAN\'s principle of non-interference in each others\' internal affairs, it appeared to have been put aside at the summit, which brought Southeast Asian nations together with the United States, Japan, China, India, Australia and Canada.

'HANOI: Typhoon Damrey slammed into Vietnam\'s south-central coast on Saturday, killing at least 15 people and leaving four others missing, officials said. In the worst-hit province of Khanh Hoa, 14 people were killed by collapsing houses or washed away by floods, the provincial disaster agency said in a statement. The typhoon destroyed 302 homes and blew roofs off of more than 25,000 others, while sinking 112 transport and fishing boats, the agency said. The typhoon also caused extensive damage to the province\'s rice fields and other crops. One person was killed and four others reported missing in the provinces of Binh Dinh and Phu Yen, disaster officials there said. Widespread blackouts were reported in the region and dozens of flights were canceled. More than 35,000 villagers in high-risk areas were evacuated to safe places before the arrival of the typhoon on Saturday morning, according to the Vietnam Disaster Management Authority. Schoolchildren in several provinces were ordered to stay home to ensure their safety. It was the second natural disaster to hit the Southeast Asian country in a month. Some 75 people were killed and 28 others were reported missing in several northern and central provinces by flooding triggered by a tropical storm last month.

'Uber is working on improving the accuracy of the blue or pin location dot in India where connectivity remains an issue. This is a bigger challenge in the Indian market due to the lack of systematic urban planning as a result of which people keep referring to landmarks instead of exact addresses.So the ride hailing company is looking at features that are inspired by the peculiar problems of India. For instance, it is introducing cached destinations features, which works offline to address Internet problems, Manik Gupta, Senior Director of Product, Marketplace and Maps told Indianexpress.com. “We are giving you a set of pickup points when you enter a destination. That is very helpful because it makes it easier for people to get to the ride, and limitations of blue dot accuracy doesn’t come in the way,” said Gupta.Notably, cached destinations (which will be rolled out in the next few weeks) work offline only while putting in destination in app, but users will need an active connection to book a ride. He added that the feature is essentially for intermittent networks or scenarios where Internet might not always be consistent.“If you look at the addressing system in India, it is very randomised, and because of that users have figured out that relying on the exact address is not a very important thing for them to go anywhere. So they search for a landmark, and this is how people navigate. That’s why we have introduced cached search so that we can show top points of interest that people are familiar with it,” he pointed out. Of course, cached destinations will be personalised to a user as well as city.Coming to the issue of Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA), which might not always be accurate, Manik says that this is a challenge that everybody in the industry faces. It isn’t just one thing that Uber takes into account while displaying the ETA on the app. Fundamentally, it depends on the route or distance, and traffic conditions based on that route.Uber’s big focus on India: Exploring offline bookings, Autohawk pilot project and more“So many things can go wrong here because the traffic can change and sometimes driver can miss a turn or the map data was not accurate for the route that we suggested. We are improving our models, trying to understand traffic better, and how we can generate better routes. It’s a lot of continuous improvements,” he added.Gupta admits that a lot of problems, including Internet connectivity, are not India-specific. So a majority of innovations that the company explores is from a global perspective. “Even in the US we have issues from time to time with service providers. A lot of work that we’re doing is global like improving the overall accuracy of the blue dot and show customised pick-up points,” he said.Reiterating his stance, Uber’s vice-president and head of product Daniel Graf said that some of the things that we see in India are similar in Brazil. However, the scenario is a little different in developed cities like London. “In India, occasionally I’m on a 3G network or even slower than that. In those conditions, to have the app working properly, you need to take special steps. Those are the conditions that we do not see in other places, like for example London,” Graf explained.Now Uber riders in India can book rides via company’s webpage m.uber.com, without the need for Uber app. This is a feature unique to India, he added. Uber’s head of engineering Apurva Dalal told Indianexpress.com that most rides in India happen via cash, and that it is still one of the most dominant methods. “Especially first time riders don’t want to set up their wallets, quickly pay by cash and see how it works. First time riders use cash a lot more,” he said.',real
'The UK has placed a temporary ban on a rare annotated copy of a book by William Shakespeare’s venerable rival Ben Jonson in an aim to keep it in the country.The rare copy of “The Silent Woman”, a comedy first performed in 1609, faces the risk of going overseas unless a buyer can be found in the next few months to match the recommended price of $63,000, reports Xinhua news agency.Jonson (1572-1637) is hailed as the most important writer of the English Renaissance after Shakespeare, having lived and worked in an age of great social change that produced some of the finest works of English literature.A spokesperson for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said the extraordinarily rare volume is the only known example of a document showing how a play by Jonson was prepared for performance.“This volume occupies a unique place among surviving materials because of the nature and range of its annotations, including stage directions, details of props, and textual corrections, which collectively do not fall into any category previously known to scholars of seventeenth-century theatre,” she said on Monday.“The volume is of outstanding interest to the study of English theatrical history.”',real
'MANILA: UN chief Antonio Guterres met Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi and urged her to take steps to ensure \"dignified\" return of hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees who have fled the country to Bangladesh following violence against them. Separately on the margins of the ASEAN summit here, the US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also met Suu Kyi and discussed the humanitarian crisis in the Rakhine state. In his meeting with Myanmar\'s State Counsellor, the UN Secretary General highlighted the need for allowing the return of displaced Muslims who have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh. The Rohingya issue also figured during a meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump last night. \"The Secretary-General and the State Counsellor discussed the situation in Rakhine State. The Secretary-General highlighted that strengthened efforts to ensure humanitarian access, safe, dignified, voluntary and sustained returns, as well as true reconciliation between communities, would be essential,\" the UN said in a statement. Over 6,00,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh from predominantly Buddhist Myanmar\'s Rakhine state since late August after large-scale violence. The crisis erupted after Rohingya rebels attacked police posts in Rakhine, triggering a military crackdown that saw hundreds of villages reduced to ashes and sparked a massive exodus. Top leaders of nearly 19 countries and officials of the UN and the European Union are here to attend the summits of powerful ASEAN and East Asia groupings. Rights groups have also slammed Nobel laureate Suu Kyi, a former democracy activist, for failing to speak up for the Rohingya or condemn festering anti-Muslim sentiment in the country following the humanitarian crisis. Guterres also mentioned about the issue at an ASEAN-UN meeting. \"It is a worrying escalation in a protracted tragedy and a potential source of instability in the region,\" he said. According to Philippine Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque, the Rohinya issue figured during ASEAN Plenary. \"Myanmar specifically said one, they are in process of attending to Kofi Annan report. Two, they welcome humanitarian assistance. And that the process of repatriation of (Rohingya) would conclude after signing of a Memorandum of Understanding with Bangladesh,\" Roque told a press conference. The report by former UN chief Kofi Annan recommended a series of measures including citizenship verification and ensuring rights and equality of the refugees to defuse the crisis.

'The top officer at US Strategic Command said on Sunday an order from President Donald Trump or any of his successors to launch nuclear weapons can be refused if that order is determined to be illegal. Air Force General John Hyten, commander of Strategic Command, told a panel at the Halifax International Security Forum today that he and Trump have had conversations about such a scenario and that he would tell Trump he couldn’t carry out an illegal strike.“If it’s illegal, guess what’s going to happen. I’m going to say, ‘Mr President, that’s illegal.’ And guess what he’s going to do? He’s going to say, ‘What would be legal?\'” Hyten said.“And we’ll come up with options with a mix of capabilities to respond to whatever the situation is, and that’s the way it works.”In the event that Trump decided to launch a nuclear attack, Hyten would provide him with strike options that are legal.The command would control nuclear forces in a war.The comments come as the threat of nuclear attack from North Korea remains a serious concern and Trump’s critics question his temperament.Trump’s taunting tweets aimed at Pyongyang have sparked concerns primarily among congressional Democrats that he may be inciting a war with North Korea.During testimony before the Foreign Relations Committee earlier this month, retired General Robert Kehler who served as the head of Strategic Command from January 2011 to November 2013, also said the US armed forces are obligated to follow legal orders, not illegal ones.Hyten said he’s talked it over with Trump.“I think some people think we’re stupid. We’re not stupid people. We think about these things a lot. When you have this responsibility how do you not think about it?,’ he said.He said he would not obey an illegal order.“You could go to jail for the rest of your life,” he said.',real
'Over the last one week, teams from Pune Newsline visited two colleges in the city — Fergusson College and the Brihan Maharashtra College of Commerce (BMCC) — to find out the students’ views on wearing helmets. At both the colleges, a majority of the students admitted to not wearing helmets.However, most students at the College of Engineering in Pune (COEP) said they were in favour of wearing one. Many of them were seen riding around the campus wearing a helmet; however, pillion riders were still without them.Sayali Salunke, a final year student of Computer Science, said she doesn’t go anywhere without her helmet. “My father won’t let me ride if I don’t wear a helmet… I also think it is safe,” she said.Sneha B, a student of Engineering in Production and Industrial Management, had different views. “I used to wear a helmet. But now I don’t. It is uncomfortable and heavy. It also causes trouble when there is too much air and dust. The dust particles on the visor block the vision,” she said.Tanmay Khare, a final year student of Mechanical Engineering from COEP, said, “I wear my helmet everyday because I feel safer. An additional benefit of the helmet is that it is less stressful to the eyes. The visor keeps the smoke and pollution away from the face.”His classmate, Atharv Naik, also wears one on a daily basis but avoids it on shorter rides. He added that most residents don’t abide by traffic rules, as cops hardly catch the defaulters.Salil Tawde said, “The traffic in Pune is horrible and nobody follows the rules. Traffic police… hardly catch violators. So, it is important that people understand the importance of wearing helmets and abide by the rules.”Mrudul Dighe, a student of Electronics and Telecommunication, said it was important to wear a helmet but it could be avoided on shorter rides. An incident, he said, has made him more cautious. “A friend of mine had an accident, and sustained severe injuries as he was not wearing a helmet,” Dhige said.Ramesh Kadam, a student of M Tech in Computer Engineering, has been consistent in following all the traffic rules. He said he was particular about always wearing a helmet, as “nobody in Pune drives safely”.Rohit Kulkarni, who works in the media department of the COEP, said helmets should be worn by everyone but people should choose wisely. “A helmet should fit you and be comfortable. However, it is difficult for girls to find a helmet specifically designed for them. Most of the shops provide unisex models, which are not always feasible.”Dashmeet Ajmani, a third-year student of Computer Engineering, said she had had some bad experiences with the first helmet she had bought. But she was careful while purchasing the second one. “My first helmet was very uncomfortable. It didn’t fit. I couldn’t even sneeze, or wear my spectacles. My current helmet is an open design. I think it’s a unisex model…” she said.Most of the students said they wear a helmet as their parents have forbidden them to ride without one. Yuvraj Chavan, who is pursuing M Tech from COEP, said, “I don’t go out without a helmet, as my family insists that I wear it.”Bhagvayshri Bhirud, meanwhile, said she rides without a helmet but thinks it is important to wear one. A third-year M Tech student, Bhirud lives near the college campus. “I don’t travel much. I hardly cover 3-4 kms on my scooty. So, I don’t need a helmet. Another issue is that helmets are too heavy to be carried around. Most of the two-wheelers have space to store helmets, but my scooty has no such slot. However, I think traffic in Pune is not safe, so everyone should mandatorily wear helmets unless they have a genuine issue,” she addedSatyajeet, a first-year student of Metallurgy Department, said, “I drive both a two-wheeler and a four-wheeler. I notice how rash some two-wheeler riders are. So, I wear a helmet because it is the only way one can ensure safety.”',real
'WASHINGTON: US bombers overflew the Korean peninsula as part of an exercise with Japanese and South Korean warplanes, the US Air Force said, days before President Donald Trump arrives in the region for a trip set to be dominated by the nuclear-armed North. Tensions are high over Pyongyang\'s ballistic missile and atomic programmes, which in recent months have seen it test ICBMs and carry out its sixth nuclear blast. Trump\'s visit will throw a spotlight on the issue, after the US President and North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un traded insults and threats of war. Flights by supersonic B-1B Lancer bombers in the area always infuriate North Korea, which condemned the drill as \"blackmail\" early Friday. Two B-1B aircraft took off from Andersen Air Force Base in Guam, and were joined west of Japan by Japan Air Self- Defense Force fighters, the US Pacific Air Force said in a statement. \"The Lancers then transited overland to Korea to integrate with Republic of Korea fighters in the Yellow Sea,\" the statement read, adding that the aircraft later returned \"to their respective home stations.\" The exercise was part of the \"continuous bomber presence\" mission in the Pacific and \"was not in response to any current event,\" the statement said. The operation follows an October 10 \"show of force\" in which two Lancers staged the first night-time joint aviation exercises with Japan and South Korea. North Korea in July launched two intercontinental ballistic missiles apparently capable of reaching the US mainland — described by Kim as a gift to \"American bastards\". It followed up with two missiles that passed over Japan, and its sixth nuclear test, by far its most powerful yet. Trump has warned of \"fire and fury\" in response to Pyongyang\'s threats, and derisively dubbed Kim \"Rocket Man\", who responded by calling him a \"dotard\". This week the North\'s KCNA news agency described the US president as \"incurably mentally deranged\". Trump will on Friday set off for his Asian tour, which will include Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. But his message risks being undermined if the North stages some kind of provocation, such as a missile test. It could be preparing for another launch, Seoul\'s spy agency reportedly said Thursday. \"Active movements of vehicles have been detected at a missile research facility in Pyongyang,\" the National Intelligence Service told a closed-door parliamentary audit, according to the Yonhap news agency. The North habitually condemns B1-B flights as rehearsals for an attack, and KCNA said Friday: \"The reality clearly shows that the gangster-like US imperialists are the very one who is aggravating the situation of the Korean peninsula and seeking to ignite a nuclear war.\" Any military strike in Korea could see retaliation and rapid escalation, and much of Seoul — a city of 10 million people — is within range of the North\'s artillery. The South\'s President Moon Jae-In has insisted that no military action on the peninsula can be taken without Seoul\'s approval. In an interview with Yonhap, Trump\'s National Security Advisor H R McMaster said diplomacy was Washington\'s \"main effort now\".

'SEOUL: South Korea and the United States agreed on Friday to keep working for a peaceful end to the North Korean nuclear crisis, but a US envoy said it was difficult to gauge the reclusive North\'s intentions as there has been \"no signal\". North Korea is under heavy international pressure to end its nuclear and missile programmes, pursued in defiance of UN Security Council resolutions, but has vowed never to give up its nuclear arsenal which it says it needs to counter perceived US aggression. Lee Do-hoon, South Korea\'s special representative for Korean peace and security affairs, and his US counterpart, Joseph Yun, met on the southern resort island of Jeju, following a summit between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and U.S. President Donald Trump in Seoul last week. \"There is no doubt that both of the presidents want to find a peaceful way in regard to North Korea\'s nuclear issue,\" Yun told reporters, according to Yonhap news agency. \"So we discussed them and we agreed the pressure campaign has to be a central element.\" Trump has said the time for talk is over but he took a softer tone on his trip to Seoul. North Korea\'s last missile test was on Sept. 15 but Lee and Yun did not seem to put much emphasis on the lull, Yonhap said, as they were unable to gauge its intentions. \"I hope that they will stop forever. But we had no communication from them so I don\'t know whether to interpret it positively or not. We have no signal from them,\" Yun said. Lee drew significance from the fact that China, the North\'s lone major ally, had sent a special envoy to Pyongyang, saying that South Korea was closely watching what would come out of the visit. The envoy arrived on Friday. Trump has traded insults and threats with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as North Korea races towards its much publicised goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the United States. The United States stations 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war. It denies North Korea\'s persistent accusation that it is planning to invade.

'THREE MONTHS after the Varnika Kundu stalking case shook Chandigarh, the transport department has proposed that women drivers may install cameras on their dashboards, which will help capture the entire front view from their vehicle.Director, State Transport Authority, Amit Talwar maintains dash cameras “are really helpful because they provide evidence” for the driver in various circumstances.He said that an advisory would be issued for general awareness in this regard. An official of the engineering wing present in the meeting of the Road Safety Council where the discussion took place, said, “In fact, the members did find such dash cams useful but they were of the view that these cannot be made mandatory for everybody but an advisory can be issued and people, especially women, should be encouraged to install such cameras. After the IAS officer’s daughter case, these cameras can be helpful in providing evidence to the police in such cases. It will capture the front view of the complete journey.”The matter came up for discussion when the STA proposed that dash cameras be installed in CTU buses, and participants agreed that these devices would not only help in providing evidence in case the CTU bus is involved in an accident, but would also record the reckless driving and any other unpleasant situation. “The videotapes can be provided to the court,” said another officer.Lt Col Jagwant Singh Bath (retired), a member of the Road Safety Council who was present in the meeting said, “In fact, such cameras are very much being used in Russia because the traffic conditions there are as worse as ours. The primary advantage of these cameras goes to the drivers as they can prove themselves with the help of recording. If [Varnika Kundu]’s car had this dash camera, the videotapes would have immediately shown what the men did.”Though most of Varnika’s ordeal consisted of the men chasing her car in their vehicle, Bath asserted that the mere presence of a camera would also act as a deterrent to such criminal conduct. He added that members decided not to make it mandatory but create more and more awareness by traffic police to install these.',real

'SYDNEY: A powerful magnitude 7 undersea earthquake struck east of New Caledonia\'s Loyalty Islands in the South Pacific on Monday, sending small tsunamis towards New Caledonia and neighbouring Vanuatu, where authorities ordered evacuations. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) in Hawaii issued a tsunami warning for coastlines within 300 kms (186 mile) of the epicentre, but later said the danger had largely passed. Monday\'s quake, initially reported as magnitude 7.3, struck at a shallow depth of 10 km (six miles) about 82 kms (51 miles) east of New Caledonia. It was the second major tremor in the same area in just over 12 hours and the third in the past month. \"We are a little bit scared, we have had an earthquake last night and today it was quite a big one,\" said Wayan Rigault, communications manager at Hotel Nengone Village on the island of Mare, which is the closest landmass to the epicentre. Rigault said there was no immediate damage, but guests were on alert for a formal evacuation warning. Small tsunamis were detected and waves may have reached up to one metre (three feet) above the high tide level in parts of New Caledonia and smaller in Vanuatu, the PTWC said. \"Minor sea level fluctuations...may continue over the next few hours,\" a statement from the agency said. Vanuatu\'s National Disaster Management Office advised people in southern provinces to evacuate coastal areas for higher ground.. New Caledonia\'s civil security agency made no plans to evacuate coastal places immediately.

'MUMBAI: Maharashtra Water Conservation Minister Ram Shinde has landed himself in a controversy after a video clip in which he is purportedly seen urinating by roadside surfaced on social media on Sunday. The incident occurred at a stretch on the Solapur-Barshi road when the minister was travelling in his car. When contacted, Shinde told PTI that he urinated in the open as he was feeling ill after spending nearly a month touring the state for the government\'s flagship Jalyukta Shivar scheme. \"I have been travelling continuously from the last one month taking review of the Jalyukta Shivar scheme. Continuous travelling in high temperatures and dust made me ill. I was suffering from fever today and when I couldn\'t find a toilet while travelling, I had to relieve myself in the open,\" Shinde said. However, the opposition NCP said the minister not finding a toilet on a highway shows that Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s Swacch Bharat Abhiyan has failed. \"It is now proved that the government has been looting people in the name of Swacch Bharat cess on petrol and diesel,\" NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said. \"How can the Prime Minister expect people to follow discipline when his own ministers are a bunch of undisciplined people? If the minister did not find a toilet on a highway, it means the government has all along been looting people in the name of Swacch Bharat cess on fuel. The minister has proved that the whole scheme is nothing but a big failure,\" Malik said.

'WITH POLLING DAY done and dusted after an extensive campaign, Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh is in a buoyant mood. “I may look relaxed but I am neither idle nor out of the job. It’s time to gain some energy as the counting of the votes will happen on December 18. I will be back in action soon with renewed energy. I am forming the next government, which is going to be a surprise to all of BJP’s top strategists. The BJP doesn’t even know that some seats they are certain of winning are coming to the Congress tally”, the 83-year old Congress veteran told a group of supporters from Shimla (Rural), from where his son Vikramaditya Singh contested this time.When an enthusiastic young supporter suggested, “Raja Sahib, our next MLA (candidate Vikramaditya Singh) should get a Cabinet berth, he retorted with a smile. “Ah, no such recommendation please. First-timers can’t be made ministers. But I am certainly looking for a bride for him and will ensure that he gets married first before giving him responsibility in the government, such as the job of a Parliamentary Secretary,” he said.The CM added, “What’s encouraging is that I will be beating the anti-incumbency factor. People talk about BJP and Congress swapping power every five years. But this time, our vote share is going to improve and number of seats will also increase. We will have comfortable numbers, maybe 40 or more. My doors are also open for Independents. A few are already in touch with me.”One of the two factors that he views as favourable to him is public endorsement to development. “So much work has been done on roads, bridges, water supply schemes, health infrastructure, many new institutions and 58 new colleges opened…” he recalled.Secondly, he says, the BJP’s “negative campaign demeaning Himachal Pradesh” and claiming that no development took place did not work for them. Their “personalised campaign targeted him on alleged corruption, he pointed out. He claimed that the BJP pumping crores of money in the campaign, and sending an array of Cabinet ministers , whose only agenda was to “spew venom” against him had generated a sympathy factor in his favour.Virbhadra said his campaign was positive and they (BJP star campaigners) failed to distract from his focus to push his development agenda.“What hurt Himachalis most was Prime Minister Narendra Modi using intemperate language against me. If I have been elected to the CM’s post six times, don’t people know my clean image, my commitment to the state and hard work? They are also aware that the cases against me are fabricated. These are aimed at finishing me off politically because the BJP sees me as the biggest hurdle in getting power,” said Chief Minister.He said former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was a “real statesman” and never resorted to unfounded criticism of any chief minister of governments of other parties.“Modiji needs to take some lessons on how Vajpayee used to conduct himself and campaign.”',real

'The father of the victim in the Ryan school murder has demanded that the juvenile accused in the case be tried as an adult. Post the Nirbhaya case, the amended Juvenile Justice Act allows juveniles above 16yrs to be tried as adults. A lowdown of laws across the world What is the minimum age of criminal responsibility? In common law, criminal liability is tested by actus reus (guilty act) and mens rea (guilty mind). This means that a criminal act alone doesn\'t warrant criminal liability. The prosecution is required to prove that the person committing the crime was mentally sound to realise the act was wrong. There is no global standard of minimum age where a child can be deemed to be mature enough to recognise consequences of a crime, but most countries have a minimum age of criminal responsibility (CR) below which it is presumed a child is incapable of committing a crime and cannot be punished. Can people above the CR age be tried as adults? And what is \'criminal majority\'? People just above the CR age can\'t be tried as adults. Many countries have a much higher age of \'criminal majority\' — typically age 18. If a person between the age of criminal responsibility and criminal majority commits a crime he/she is protected by the country\'s juvenile justice system and typically isn\'t required to serve sentences alongside adults. In India, the Juvenile Justice Act of 2000 that took reformative approach towards juveniles under the age 18 was replaced by the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act 2015. The new act allows children aged 16 to 18 years to be tried as adults for heinous offences. In the US, many states allow juveniles to be tried as adult if they have committed heinous crimes. In 2001, 14-year-old Lionel Tate was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole for murdering a 6-year-old girl in 1999. Tate was only 12 at the time of the crime and became the youngest person in the US to get such a severe sentence. Has there been a steady increase in crimes by juveniles? According to National Crime Records Bureau, the rate of crimes committed by juveniles and the total number of cases against them declined in 2015 compared to 2014. Compared to 2005, the crime rate has increased. However, juvenile crime as a proportion of all crimes has remained at about 1\%.

'Last Updated Jul 26, 2017 4:23 AM EDTWELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Three wild rabbits managed to escape rising floodwaters in New Zealand by clambering aboard a flock of sheep and surfing to safety on their woolly backs.Ferg Horne, 64, says he\'s been farming since he left school at age 15 and has never seen anything quite like it.He was trudging through pelting rain to rescue a neighbor\'s 40 sheep from the floodwaters on Saturday at their South Island farm near Dunedin when he spotted some dark shapes from a distance.He was puzzled because he knew his neighbor, who was away in Russia attending a nephew\'s wedding, didn\'t have any black-faced sheep. As he got closer, he thought it might be debris from the storm, which had drenched the area and forced Horne to evacuate his home.Then he saw the bedraggled rabbits hitching a ride - two on one sheep and a third on another sheep.\"I couldn\'t believe it for a start,\" he said.Nobody else would believe him either without proof, he thought, so he got out his phone to take a photo, an image he figured his grandchildren would enjoy. In fact, he inadvertently shot a short video.\"It\'s a Samsung or a smartphone or whatever you call it. I swear at it every day,\" he said. \"I\'m absolutely useless with technology.\"Nevertheless, Horne managed to capture the moment. He said the sheep were huddled together on a high spot on the farm, standing in about 3 inches of water.He said the rabbits looked like they\'d gotten wet but seemed quite comfortable and relaxed atop their mounts.Rabbits are considered a pest to farmers in New Zealand, and Horne said that typically when he sees one, he shoots it.\"But they\'d showed so much initiative, I thought they deserved to live, those rabbits,\" he said.Horne herded the sheep to a patch of dry ground on the farm about 164 feet away. The sheep didn\'t like it.\"As they jumped through the water, the rabbits had a jolly good try at staying on,\" Horne said.He said the rabbits appeared to cling onto the wool with their paws. As they approached the higher ground, the rabbits fell off but managed to climb a hedge to safety.Horne returned later that afternoon. The floodwaters were receding, the sheep were all safe and the rabbits were long gone.Horne said his home had also remained dry.He then sent his video to his son, who sent images to the local newspaper and posted them on Facebook, as Horne doesn\'t have his own page.\"From then on it\'s just gone crazy,\" he said.',real

'Beloved book and animated cartoon character Winnie the Pooh is being censored in China, according to BBC News.The Chinese name for Winnie the Pooh (Little Bear Winnie) is being blocked on Chinese social media sites because bloggers have been comparing the plump bear to China\'s President Xi Jinping, the BBC reports. Animated GIFs of the character were deleted from the app WeChat, and those who comment on the site Weibo with \"Little Bear Winnie\" get an error message.One internet meme that went viral was an encounter between Xi and Japan\'s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during an awkward handshake. Social media users combined the image of the two politicians with that of Eeyore and Winnie the Pooh.Another moment that was memorialized by social media users was from 2015, when Xi popped out of the top of a limousine. A meme was born when an image was found of Pooh in his very own car.A photo showing a meeting between Xi and President Obama provided another popular meme in 2013. This time, a picture showed Winnie the Pooh and his smiling friend Tigger, walking side by side.The BBC reports that the ban mainly applies to comments on Weibo, a Facebook-like social network used by 340 million people a month, which makes it more popular than Twitter, according to the BBC.The crackdown on Winnie the Pooh and ridicule of China\'s leaders is strategically timed, the BBC says. There\'s an important Communist Party conference scheduled, with several top government jobs up for grabs.Chinese officials reportedly can block certain phrases to shut down discussions that run against the Communist Party.Recently, authorities were able to virtually remove any existence of China\'s top dissident Liu Xiaobo, the BBC reports. Liu won the Nobel Peace Prize, and died last week in custody. He was a professor, a writer and a human rights activist known for his participation in the infamous Tiananmen Square protests. CBS News\' Pamela Falk says he was an inspiration to a generation of young Chinese students and pro-democracy activists around the world.',real
'Last Updated Jun 28, 2017 6:46 PM EDTBEVERLY, Mass. -- Kayla Doig was unpacking her groceries on Monday when a fox bounded out of her neighbor\'s yard, bit her leg and latched on, reports CBS Boston.Doig -- still holding groceries -- told the station she began throwing boxes of waffles and K-cups at the animal.On Facebook, she wrote that the fox \"continued to bite me multiple times on my leg, and next thing I remember is being face-down on my front yard while my dad tried to fight it off.\"Doig says she was left with two bite marks on her left leg.After a trip to the hospital for anti-rabies shots and a prescribed plan for continued treatment over the next 10 days, Doig said she\'s doing fine.She assured her Facebook friends, \"Currently, I am okay, just in pain. Thankfully I have some waffles and coffee!\"Doig\'s father scared the fox away.\"I heard Kayla starting to say, \'No, no, no. Get away,\"\' Bruce Doig said. \"When you see somebody, especially your child, being attacked like that, it\'s painful.\"Police in Beverly, a city some 24 miles northeast of Boston, said she was the second person in town to be bitten by a fox.Doig says she was attacked about five hours after the first incident, which happened just a block away.\"It\'s really crazy. I was not expecting something like that to happen, especially outside my own house.\"Doig added that a fox was hit and killed by a truck on Tuesday.Hoping it\'s the same fox that bit Doig, officials are having it tested for rabies.',real

'MURFREESBORO, Ark. -- An Oklahoma woman made a sparkly discovery when she visited the Crater of Diamonds State Park in Arkansas last weekend, CBS affiliate WHNT in Huntsville, Arkansas, reports.Victoria Brodski, 25, of Tulsa, was searching for diamonds with her family for 10 minutes when she found a shiny rock that she originally thought was a piece of glass. She put the rock in her pocket and went to the Diamond Discovery Center a few hours later where officials said she had discovered a 2.65-carat diamond.Officials said the diamond is now the second largest found in the park this year. In March, a teenager discovered a 7.44-carat diamond of his own.Brodski named the brown diamond Michelangelo, after the character from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. While searching the park, her family agreed to yell out the names of the \"heroes in a half shell\" as code words for finding diamonds.\"When I learned that I had found a diamond, I called my mom and said, \'Michelangelo,\'\" she said in a statement.Brodski now plans to sell the diamond and split the profit with her family.',real
'BALTIMORE -- A woman who police dubbed the \"Hamburglar\" has turned herself in, CBS Baltimore reports.Tips came flooding in after police posted a video of 27-year-old Jessica Cross breaking into a drive-thru window at a McDonald\'s restaurant in Columbia.Cross was taken into custody Thursday morning. She\'s being charged with burglary and theft.Police say Cross allegedly stole $1,400 in cash, a purse, food items and Happy Meal toys from the restaurant.Surveillance video shows a white Hyundai Sonata pulling into the McDonald\'s drive-thru.

'PITTSBURGH -- A western Pennsylvania woman who was charged with fatally stabbing her physician father told police she was motivated by the movie \"The Mummy Returns.\"Authorities say Christina Nicassio, 27, stabbed her 69-year-old father, Anthony, sometime before 3 a.m. Saturday at his home in Plum, Pa. Upon their arrival, paramedics located Anthony suffering from a stab wound to his chest. He was pronounced dead at the scene.A preliminary investigation revealed the victim and his wife were trying to take Nicassio to a hospital because she was distraught over a recent relationship breakup, but instead, she stabbed her father who was an internist at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC).In a statement, the hospital said: \"We are deeply saddened by the death of Dr. Nicassio who was a dedicated and skilled physician who devoted his life to compassionate care of his patients.\"According to CBS Pittsburgh, Nicassio had recently broken up with her boyfriend. Her parents called police to say she was suicidal and had a knife when the incident unfolded.During an interview with detectives, Nicassio said she \"got played by Hollywood.\" When asked for clarification, she said \"in a movie, someone who can\'t love someone else, they stab their father\" -- saying that\'s what she took from the \"Mummy\" film.Nicassio was booked on homicide charges at the Allegheny County Jail. It remains unclear when she will make her first court appearance.',real

'We all ask our friends for favors. Usually, it\'s things like rides to the airport or help moving someplace new. I asked my friends to come to my place and eat crickets with me.\"I told everyone at work today I\'m eating crickets tonight,\" my friend Hannah says to me, while I dole out critters into small plastic cups, one flavored cricket per cup.Some nights you just know are going to be weird.When my friends Amelia and Adam arrive, we all sit around my dining room table to eat bugs, with two vital ground rules: No Jiminy Cricket jokes. And don\'t look the crickets in the eyes.At first, silence -- occasionally punctuated by the barely audible crunch of bugs meeting teeth. But quickly, we\'re erupting in nervous laughter. The taste test moves on from single crickets to bugs straight from the pouch, a few at a time. The whole-roasted crickets -- which come in flavors like Totally Taco, spicy hot, sea salt and vinegar -- are small, brown and give off a vaguely malty smell and taste that seeps through every seasoning. We crunch, chew, swallow and feel around our teeth for bug parts that get left behind.I try not to spend too much time looking into the pouches. It\'s a massacre in there.All of us eat more crickets than I expect, reaching into the pouches for another helping and getting cricket dust all over our fingers. We establish that the bigger the cricket, the bigger the crunch, and that perhaps you\'ve got to eat a few crickets at a time to really get a sense of the flavor.Adam thinks the crickets disintegrate too quickly. Amelia finds the texture too ashy. Hannah\'s winning tasting note reads: \"Wings!\"The big question: Would they do it again?\"I don\'t think I\'m ever going to do Netflix and crickets,\" Amelia says.Adam thinks he could opt for the protein boost during a workout -- these crickets have about 11 grams of protein in a 28-gram bag, compared with about 7 grams from 28 grams of ground beef. Hannah says they could work in a trail mix.As an alternative to (or maybe a reprieve from) whole-roasted crickets, I bust out maple cashew granola and chocolate chip cookies made with cricket powder. All of us like the fact we can\'t taste much cricket at all.I\'ll eat anything with taco seasoning on it. Even so, I\'m a little surprised to return to the Totally Taco pouch and absentmindedly pull out another cricket as if it\'s a potato chip.But as serious as the discussion sometimes gets over flavors we\'d like to try and whether every cricket wore the same amount of seasoning as its dead compatriot, none of us could get away from the realization that we\'d just eaten bugs.\"If we all wake up tomorrow and have super powers -- or wings...,\" Hannah says, her voice trailing off. \"I can\'t go to my cousin\'s wedding with wings, guys.\"Eating insects is nothing new. If anything, I was re-introducing my friends to something humans have been doing for millennia. Pliny the Elder wrote that Roman aristocrats loved to eat beetle larvae reared on flour and wine. Aristotle wrote that cicada larvae taste best \"before the husk is broken. At first the males are better to eat,\" but females improve when they\'re \"full of white eggs.\" You can even find bug-eating references in Leviticus.Today, cultures across Africa, Asia and Latin American embrace creepy crawly cuisine. In fact, the United Nations estimates at least 2 billion people include bugs in their diets, and there are about 1,900 species including beetles, palm weevil larvae, locusts, ants and grasshoppers just waiting to end up on your plate.If anything, we\'re the weirdos.We might have to get used to the idea. The UN expects the global population to grow by 2 billion people in the next 30 years, reaching 9.8 billion by 2050 -- likely doubling the world\'s demand for meat. That\'s where munching a bunch of beetles, crickets, grasshoppers, mealworms and other bugs comes in. Insects grow faster and require fewer resources than livestock do, while emitting fewer greenhouse gasses.And yes, there are health benefits. While every bug offers something different nutritionally, studies show crickets and mealworms can compete with or even outdo meats like beef and chicken in certain respects, depending on species and what they\'re fed. The average insect is around half protein by dry weight, according to Precision Nutrition.That ratio could become even more lopsided, says Jeffrey Swada, director of food science at Michigan State University. That\'s because crickets are efficient about using what they eat, and there\'s research being done on what you can feed crickets to make them even more nutrient-rich.This is mostly old news for the pro-bug crowd.\"One of the main reasons to eat bugs is that there isn\'t any reason not to,\" says Daniella Martin, author of \"Edible: An Adventure into the World of Eating Insects and the Last Great Hope to Save the Planet.\" \"We are constantly looking for more sustainable options and we are constantly looking to diversify the sources of our nutrition. If that is our ultimate goal, there\'s no reason not to include insects.\"Also, she likes the taste.The first time Mohammed Ashour ate a cricket, he was on live TV.Ashour and a team of fellow McGill University classmates were in the running for the Hult Prize, a global competition for university students focusing on generating ideas for social good. And they were working on a business plan to address that year\'s theme of food insecurity (or in plain English, unreliable access to nutritious food).They wanted to create a sustainable protein source. Put more simply, they wanted to farm crickets for US consumption and fattier palm weevil larvae (also called coconut grubs) for people in Ghana.During the competition, a local TV station invited Ashour to its morning show and asked him to bring along some crickets to eat. The reporter looked at him and asked, \"Will you try one with me?\" It was a moment of truth.\"I wasn\'t ready for that. I needed my own ritual. I needed to spend some time to think and meditate and get myself over things,\" Ashour tells me.But it was live TV, so he grabbed a cricket mounted on a wedge of white chocolate and bit down, knowing that no matter what, he had to look like he enjoyed it.To his surprise, he did -- even without the chocolate.Ashour\'s team won the Hult Prize and its $1 million purse with their vision of using data, robotics and automation to build a cricket farm. They\'re now the Aspire Food Group, based in Austin, Texas. But don\'t expect to find bucolic fields and non-hipster flannel at Aspire\'s farm. It\'s actually a 25,000-square-foot building designed for cricket-raising, in a business park that\'s about a 10-minute drive from downtown.\"Looking from the outside, you\'d never imagine this was a cricket farm,\" says Ashour. With high ceilings, polished concrete floors and a viewing area behind glass that looks into the farm itself, this isn\'t Old MacDonald\'s turf. It looks more like a regular office building with bins stacked on vertical racks.Each bin can hold about 10,000 to 15,000 crickets at a time. Since crickets take about a month to become big enough to harvest, Aspire produces roughly 22 million every month.Those crickets will then get cleaned, slow roasted (sans legs and antennae) and either ground up into powder or seasoned and packaged under the brand name Aketta, ready for consumption.After moving to Austin in 2014, Ashour and his teammates spent a year or so learning everything they could about the biology of raising crickets. In 2016, they developed a process to cheaply and efficiently raise them, cutting down on manual labor. Humans originally fed the crickets, for example -- dumping extra feed into the bins at the end of the day to get them through the night. Now, automated robots on wheels handle chowtime.Aspire also uses sensors to collect more than 30 million data points relating to habitat, like temperature and humidity.\"That\'s where a lot of data science and a lot of deep learning and machine learning stuff starts to happen,\" Ashour tells me.Chief technology officer Michael Hall says all that data gets fed into an algorithm that figures out optimal factors for things like time and temperature, so Aspire can develop best practices for cricket growing. The big idea is specificity -- like finding the ideal habitat conditions for a cricket at 3 p.m. on day 7 of its life.\"Twenty years ago, if you were trying to measure the temperature and humidity a thousand places in a room, someone would look at you like you\'re crazy,\" Hall says of Aspire\'s sensor-happy setup.It\'s a lot of uncharted territory, despite the fact that cricket farming and cricket snacks are starting to jump in popularity (sorry). There\'s even an organization of cricket industry \"stakeholders,\" called the North American Coalition for Insect Agriculture. Yet as Ashour points out, there\'s not a lot of institutional knowledge about automated cricket farming to fall back on. Much of the technology Aspire uses is proprietary, and it even uses 3D printing to make parts it can\'t find in stores.Believe it or not, there are trendier places to eat crickets than my apartment.The Odd Duck restaurant in Austin -- which is near a spa, at least two yoga studios and a juice bar -- regularly serves Aspire\'s Aketta crickets. Chef Mark Buley describes it as a small-plates restaurant -- think Spanish tapas-style portions colliding with American food and a light infestation of crickets on the dinner menu. Yelp gives it four and a half stars and three dollar signs.\"[Crickets are] totally an inoffensive texture. It\'s light and crispy versus that crunchy gooey that everyone was expecting,\" Buley says, telling me how Odd Duck often fries its crickets and tosses them with an in-house blend of spices called Nacho Spice.So far, no one\'s run out the door after getting served chilled melon, smoked green tomato, red onion and cricket togarashi (a peppery Japanese condiment).But Odd Duck isn\'t such an odd duck for serving bugs.There\'s also Don Bugito, a \"prehistoric snackeria\" in the San Francisco Bay Area that sells pouches of crickets and toasted mealworms cooked in the pre-Columbian tradition. Saison, a French-American restaurant in San Francisco, gets science-y about its crickets. At Saison\'s requests, Aspire will feed a batch of crickets lemongrass so the critters assume their own lemongrass flavor. Poquitos in Seattle offers chapulines: toasted grasshoppers with chile-lime salt seasoning. And $4 will buy you a 4-ounce cup of toasted grasshoppers at Seattle Mariners\' Safeco Field.All of this speaks to the idea that bugs aren\'t just good for you or the planet. They\'re actually tasty.\"We\'ve fallen victim to this really popular idea that eating crickets is all about hiding the flavor,\" says Andrew Zimmern, host of the Travel Channel\'s \"Bizarre Foods,\" who just really appreciates a nice, wok-tossed bumble bee.Zimmern tells me about the joys of sauteed, buttered beetles and coconut grubs marinated in sour orange juice -- but says he isn\'t surprised that most of us think bugs are gross. We haven\'t eaten them prepared with any care or skill.\"A freeze-dried, 2-year-old cricket, seasoned with cheese dust, sold in a novelty pack at a tchotchke store is not going to get anyone excited about eating crickets,\" he says.Ashour says he realizes he can\'t win customers by beating them over the head with a moral argument. But Aspire is hoping folks will eventually be able to draw a distinction between the bug on their wall and the bug in their lunchbox -- and that using a name like Aketta could provide the type of disassociation people get from the word \"pork\" instead of pig.It\'s hard to understate how important that is. On the drive home from shooting a video for this story, where I\'d crammed a giant handful of crickets into my mouth like popcorn, I couldn\'t stop thinking about all those black-eyed dead bugs around my teeth -- or the sensation of wiping cricket dust off my chin.It broke me a little.But my friend Hannah had a different take. Now that she\'s tried crickets, she\'s pretty sure she\'d buy them if she saw them in a store.\"I\'m really glad, intellectually, that I ate crickets,\" she told me. \"I can now tell people I\'ve eaten crickets and they were taco-flavored, and I would do it again.\"Bug appetite.This article originally appeared on CNET.',real
'KUALA LUMPUR: When Zakir Naik+ emerged from a prominent Malaysian mosque last month fans swarmed about him, seeking selfies with the Indian Muslim televangelist whose hardline views have sparked a criminal investigation back in his home country. Accompanied by a bodyguard, Naik was making a rare public appearance at the Putra Mosque in Malaysia\'s administrative capital, where the prime minister and his cabinet members often worship. Zakir Naik+ , who has been banned in the UK, has been given permanent residency in Malaysia, and embraced by top government officials. Critics see Naik\'s presence in Malaysia as another sign of top-level support for hardline Islam in a country with substantial minorities of Christians, Hindus and Buddhists, and which has long projected a moderate Islamic image. Support for a more politicised Islam has grown in recent years under Prime Minister Najib Razak, especially after he lost the popular vote in the 2013 general election - the ruling coalition\'s worst-ever electoral performance. Since then, his ruling party has been trying to appease an increasingly conservative ethnic Malay-Muslim base and religion has become a battleground ahead of elections the prime minister has to call by mid-2018. Naik, a 52-year-old medical doctor, has aroused controversy with his puritan brand of Islam - recommending the death penalty for homosexuals and those who abandon Islam as their faith, according to media reports. A Youtube video shows Naik saying that if Osama bin Laden \"is terrorizing America the terrorist, the biggest terrorist, I am with him\". Last week, India\'s counter-terrorism agency NIA prepared charges against Naik, saying he has been \"promoting enmity and hatred between different religious groups in India through public speeches and lectures.\" Bangladesh suspended Peace TV channel, which features Naik\'s preachings, after some media reports claimed bombers of a Dhaka cafe that killed 22 people last year were admirers of him. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack. The Malaysian government accommodates Naik because \"he remains a reasonably popular character amongst Malays, who gloss over his more controversial aspects,\" said Rashaad Ali, an analyst with S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS) in Singapore. \"If the government were to kick him out of the country, it causes them to lose religious credibility in the eyes of the public.\" Facebook photos At his appearance at the Putra mosque last month, a female Reuters reporter asked about the investigation in India. Naik would only say: \"Sorry, it is not right for me to speak with ladies in public.\" Naik did not respond to subsequent requests for comment from Reuters. Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi told parliament on Tuesday that Naik, who obtained permanent residency five years ago, was not being given \"preferential treatment\". \"Over the time spent in this country, he has not broken any laws or regulations. As such, there is no reason from a legal standpoint to detain or arrest him,\" Zahid said. The government has not received any official request from India \"related to terrorism allegations involving him\", he added. Zahid and the prime minister have both posted photos on Facebook of their meetings with Naik last year in Malaysia. A group of Malaysian activists has filed suit in the High Court to deport Naik, saying he is a threat to public peace in the multi-racial society - about 40 percent of Malaysia\'s population is non-Muslim. The group said it was unaware Naik had been going to the Putrajaya mosque - or where he might be in Malaysia. Officials at the Putra Mosque said Naik has been attending Friday prayers there for about a month. He has also been spotted in other mosques, hospitals and restaurants in the administrative capital in recent months, according to witnesses that Reuters spoke to. Naik has in the past denied India\'s allegations. In an interview with a Kuwaiti television channel in May, he said he was being targeted by the Hindu nationalist government of Narendra Modi because of his popularity. Malaysia\'s opposition Islamic Party (PAS), which has defended Naik in the past, last week urged the government to disregard any potential Indian extradition request, saying the allegations aim \"to block his influence and efforts to spread religious awareness among the international community.\" Nine sultans Islamic groups have stoked controversy for trying to impose their ethos in a multi-cultural country. Malaysian authorities cancelled a planned beer festival last month, citing security concerns, and for some years now international pop stars who wish to make appearances in Malaysia face restrictions over clothing and dancing. Islam is the official religion in Malaysia. The laws, however, are secular, though the country does have sharia courts for civil cases for Muslims. Malaysia\'s nine sultans, who take turns as the mostly ceremonial monarch and are the official guardians of Islam in Malaysia, last month called for unity and religious harmony after what they described as \"excessive actions\" in the name of Islam. One of them harshly condemned a Muslim-only launderette. \"We are seeing this gravitation towards fundamentalism and a conservative idea of Islam because the current government doesn\'t want to be seen as secular anymore,\" said Ahmad Farouk Musa, founder of a moderate Islam think-tank, Islamic Renaissance Front (IRF). To ensure Malay support, the government thinks it has \"to have Islamic credentials just like PAS,\" Farouk told Reuters. said. \"Islam sells.\" In September, Turkish writer Mustafa Akyol was detained for giving \"an unauthorised speech\" in the Malaysian capital, in which he argued that governments shouldn\'t police religion or morality. Zahid, also the home minister, said Akyol\'s book \"Islam Without Extremes: A Muslim Case for Liberty\" has been banned as it \"contravened norms of the society in Malaysia\". Farouk, who organised the speech, said he now faces charges for abetting Akyol.

'HARARE: A lot has happened in the past few days in Zimbabwe, where the world\'s oldest head of state tries to remain in power even under military house arrest. Thousands of giddy Zimbabweans are in the streets to demand his departure, tired of a collapsing economy that once was one of Africa\'s strongest. Here\'s a quick guide to the key events and players: MUGABE The 93-year-old President Robert Mugabe has been under house arrest since Tuesday, when the military moved in. That decision was sparked by Mugabe\'s firing of his longtime deputy, leading to fears that the president was positioning his unpopular wife, Grace, to succeed him. Mugabe is said to be asking for more time amid negotiations on his departure. The military has been taking pains to refer to him as president and allowed him to make a public appearance Friday at a graduation ceremony, where he received polite applause. THE PEOPLE Several thousand people are in the streets of the capital, Harare, to demand Mugabe\'s exit as Zimbabweans giddily explore the rare freedom of expression amid the political limbo. Saturday\'s demonstration was approved by the military and has participation from across the political spectrum, from Mugabe\'s once-staunch loyalists among the liberation war veterans to opposition activists long-used to police crackdowns. THE MILITARY Zimbabwe\'s army commander on Monday threatened to \"step in\" after Mugabe fired Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa, and the next day he did. In an extraordinary image later in the week, state-run media published photos of Gen. Constantino Chiwenga shaking hands with a smiling Mugabe at the State House as negotiations with regional leaders continued. The military is trying not to project the image of a coup, which could bring regional sanctions and further harm the country\'s standing with international investors. THE NEXT LEADERS? Mnangagwa fled the country shortly after his firing by Mugabe and his whereabouts are unknown. He is expected to lead any new government, and his supporters say he will make a public appearance once arrangements for Mugabe\'s exit are complete. High-profile opposition leaders such as Morgan Tsvangiari, who shared power with Mugabe between 2009 and 2013 before losing disputed elections, are expected to play a role in a new government, but they have said they have not been contacted by those taking part in the Mugabe negotiations. THE FIRST LADY Grace Mugabe has been out of the picture, literally, since the military stepped in. Once ever-present at her husband\'s side at public events, she has not been seen in days. The quick-tempered first lady, deeply unpopular among Zimbabweans for her lavish spending and for multiple allegations against her for assault, did not accompany the president at Friday\'s graduation ceremony. And she was not pictured in the photographs of the State House negotiations. Despite rumors that she has fled the country, she is thought to remain under house arrest.

'HARARE: Robert Mugabe agreed on Sunday to resign as Zimbabwe\'s president hours after the ruling ZANU-PF party fired him as its leader following 37 years in charge, a source familiar with the negotiations said. ZANU-PF had given the 93-year-old less than 24 hours to quit as head of state or face impeachment, an attempt to secure a peaceful end to his tenure after a de facto coup. The source said the Zimbabwe military was working on a resignation statement by Mugabe, without giving details. Zimbabwe\'s state broadcaster ZBC said Mugabe would address the nation shortly. Earlier on Sunday, the official Herald newspaper showed pictures of him meeting top generals at his State House offices. Mugabe, the only leader the southern African nation has known since independence from Britain in 1980, was replaced by Emmerson Mnangagwa, the deputy he sacked this month in a move that triggered the mid-week intervention by the army. In scenes unthinkable just a week ago, the announcement drew cheers from the 200 delegates packed into ZANU-PF\'s Harare headquarters to seal the fate of Mugabe, whose support has crumbled in the four days since the army seized power. Mugabe was given until noon (1000 GMT) on Monday to resign or face impeachment, an ignominious end to the career of the \"Grand Old Man\" of African politics who was once feted across the continent as an anti-colonial liberation hero. Even in the West, he was renowned in his early years as the \"Thinking Man\'s Guerrilla\", an ironic nickname for a man who would later proudly declare he held a \"degree in violence\". As the economy crumbled and political opposition to his rule grew in the late 1990s, Mugabe seized thousands of white-owned farms, detained opponents and unleashed security forces to crush dissent. When the vote was announced, war veterans leader Chris Mutsvangwa, who has spearheaded an 18-month campaign to remove a man he openly described as a \"dictator\", embraced colleagues and shouted: \"The President is gone. Long live the new President.\" Mugabe\'s 52-year-old wife Grace, who had harboured ambitions of succeeding her husband, was also expelled from ZANU-PF, along with at least three cabinet ministers who had formed the backbone of her \"G40\" political faction. Speaking before the meeting, Mutsvangwa said Mugabe, who has so far resisted calls to quit, was running out of time to negotiate his departure and should leave the country while he could. \"He\'s trying to bargain for a dignified exit,\" he said. If Mugabe refused to go, \"we will bring back the crowds and they will do their business,\" Mutsvangwa told reporters. Mnangagwa, a former state security chief known as \"The Crocodile,\" is expected to head an interim post-Mugabe unity government that will focus on rebuilding ties with the outside world and stabilising an economy in freefall. The next presidential election is due in 2018. On Saturday, hundreds of thousands of people flooded the streets of Harare, singing, dancing and hugging soldiers in an outpouring of elation at Mugabe\'s expected overthrow. His stunning downfall is likely to send shockwaves across Africa, where a number of entrenched strongmen, from Uganda\'s Yoweri Museveni to Democratic Republic of Congo\'s Joseph Kabila, are facing mounting pressure to step down. \"Ready to die\" On Saturday, men, women and children ran alongside the armoured cars and troops who stepped in to target what the army called \"criminals\" in Mugabe\'s inner circle. Meanwhile, the man himself remained under house arrest in his lavish \"Blue Roof\" compound, watching the support from his party, security services and people evaporate. Speaking from a secret location in South Africa, his nephew, Patrick Zhuwao, told Reuters Mugabe and his wife were \"ready to die for what is correct\" rather than step down in order to legitimise what he described as a coup. Zhuwao, who was also sanctioned by ZANU-PF, did not answer his phone on Sunday. However, Mugabe\'s son Chatunga railed against those who had pushed out his father. \"You can\'t fire a Revolutionary leader!\" he wrote on this Facebook page. \"ZANU-PF is nothing without President Mugabe.\" \"Second liberation\" On Harare\'s streets, few seemed to care about the legal niceties as they heralded a \"second liberation\" and spoke of their dreams for political and economic change after two decades of deepening repression and hardship. More than 3 million Zimbabweans - around 20 percent of the population - have emigrated to neighbouring South Africa in search of a better life. The huge crowds in Harare have given a quasi-democratic veneer to the army\'s intervention, backing its assertion that it is merely effecting a constitutional transfer of power, rather than a plain coup, which would risk a diplomatic backlash. Despite the euphoria, some Mugabe opponents are uneasy about the prominent role played by the military, and fear Zimbabwe might be swapping one army-backed autocrat for another, rather than allowing the people to choose their next leader. \"The real danger of the current situation is that having got their new preferred candidate into State House, the military will want to keep him or her there, no matter what the electorate wills,\" former education minister David Coltart said. The United States, a longtime Mugabe critic, said it was looking forward to a new era in Zimbabwe, while President Ian Khama of neighbouring Botswana said Mugabe had no diplomatic support in the region and should resign at once. Besides changing its leadership, ZANU-PF said it wanted to change the constitution to reduce the power of the president, a possible sign of its desire to move towards a more pluralistic and inclusive political system. However, Mnangagwa\'s history as state security chief during the so-called Gukurahundi crackdown, when an estimated 20,000 people were killed by the North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade in Matabeleland in the early 1980s, suggested that quick, sweeping change was unlikely. \"The deep state that engineered this change of leadership will remain, thwarting any real democratic reform,\" said Miles Tendi, a Zimbabwean academic at Oxford University.

'HARARE: Zimbabwe\'s ruling party on Monday ordered impeachment proceedings to begin against President Robert Mugabe and expressed confidence that he could be voted out within two days, while the world\'s oldest head of state ignored the party\'s midday deadline to resign and instead summoned ministers to a cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning. The ruling ZANU-PF party\'s deputy secretary for legal affairs Paul Mangwana said lawmakers would move a motion for impeachment on Tuesday and set up a parliamentary committee, and on Wednesday the committee would report back to all lawmakers and \"we vote him out.\" The main charge against the 93-year-old Mugabe is \"allowing his wife to usurp government powers\" and that \"he is too old and cannot even walk without help,\" Mangwana told reporters. He said the ruling party needs the backing of the MDC opposition group to have enough votes in parliament but \"we have talked to them and they are supporting us.\" Zimbabweans were stunned by Mugabe\'s defiance during a national address on Sunday night in which the increasingly isolated president, put under military house arrest last week, had been expected to step down. A notice by Mugabe\'s chief secretary announced on Tuesday morning\'s cabinet meeting at State House and said all ministers \"should attend.\" However, a tweet by one minister, Jonathan Moyo, indicated that several had left the country. The military appears to favour a voluntary resignation for Mugabe, one of Africa\'s last remaining liberation leaders, to maintain a veneer of legality in the political transition and avoid accusations of a coup. Mugabe, in turn, is likely using whatever leverage he has left to try to preserve his legacy or even protect himself and his family from possible prosecution. Amid the political confusion, the government on Monday urged Cabinet ministers to pursue business as usual. Meanwhile, opposition activists and the influential liberation war veterans association announced more demonstrations to pressure Mugabe to go. \"Your time is up,\" veterans association leader Chris Mutsvangwa said at a press conference. He suggested that the military was still beholden to Mugabe and compelled to protect him because he is officially their \"commander in chief\". The war veterans\' association will go to court to argue that Mugabe is \"derelict of his executive duty\", he said. Mugabe was stripped of his party leadership on Sunday by the ruling party\'s central committee but said in his speech he would preside over a party congress next month. That congress is expected to ratify his firing as party chief, the expulsion of the unpopular first lady and the naming of Mugabe\'s recently fired deputy, Emmerson Mnangagwa, to succeed him. The firing of Mnangagwa and the positioning of first lady Grace Mugabe to succeed her husband as president led the military to step in last week. Mugabe has discussed his possible exit on two occasions with military commanders. At the University of Zimbabwe, students protested and refused to sit for exams, demanding that Mugabe step down. The spokesman for the Zimbabwe National Students Union, Zivai Mhetu, said they want all universities shut down until he does. The once-formidable Mugabe is now virtually powerless, largely confined to his private home by the military. Yet he sought to project authority in his speech on Sunday, which he delivered after shaking hands with security force commanders. The army commander himself leaned over a couple of times to help the president find his place on the page he was reading. \"I, as the president of Zimbabwe, as their commander in chief, do acknowledge the issues they have drawn my attention to, and do believe that these were raised in the spirit of honesty and out of deep and patriotic concern for the stability of our nation and for the welfare of our people,\" Mugabe said.

'HARARE: Zimbabwe\'s President Robert Mugabe appeared in public on Friday for the first time since the army took charge, as the ruling party made plans to force him to step down after more than three decades in power. The president, who is 93, opened a graduation ceremony at Zimbabwe Open University in Harare. He wore blue and yellow academic robes and a mortar board hat and appeared to fall asleep in his chair as his eyes closed and his head lolled. Mugabe led the country\'s liberation struggle and has dominated its politics since independence in 1980 but this week\'s army takeover signals the collapse of his authority despite his insistence he remains in charge. A senior member of the ZANU-PF ruling party said it wanted him gone. \"If he becomes stubborn, we will arrange for him to be fired on Sunday,\" the source said. \"When that is done, it\'s impeachment on Tuesday.\" In contrast, the military said in a statement on national television it was \"engaging\" with Mugabe. It referred to him as commander-in-chief and said it would announce an outcome as soon as possible. The ruling ZANU-PF party has called for a mass meeting in the capital on Saturday to show its support for the War Veterans group in their bid to remove Mugabe. The army appears to want him to go quietly and allow a transition to Emmerson Mnangagwa, whose sacking last week as vice-president triggered the takeover. A goal of the generals is to prevent Mugabe handing power to his wife, Grace, who appeared on the cusp of power after Mnangagwa was pushed out. Zimbabwe\'s official newspaper, the Herald, ran photographs late on Thursday showing Mugabe grinning and shaking hands with military chief General Constantino Chiwenga, who seized power this week. The images stunned Zimbabweans who said it meant Mugabe was managing to hold out against Chiwenga\'s coup. Some political sources said he was trying to delay his departure until elections scheduled for next year. The ZANU-PF source said that was not the case. Anxious to avoid a protracted stalemate, party leaders were drawing up plans to dismiss Mugabe at the weekend if he refused to quit, the source said. \"There is no going back,\" the source said. The army is camped on his doorstep. Grace Mugabe is under house arrest and her key political allies are in military custody. The police, once a bastion of support, have showed no signs of resistance.

'HARARE: Zimbabwe\'s military appeared to be in control of the country on Wednesday as generals denied staging a coup but used state television to vow to target \"criminals\" close to President Robert Mugabe. Mugabe\'s decades-long grip on power was dramatically weakened as military vehicles blocked roads outside the parliament in Harare+ and senior soldiers delivered a late-night television address to the nation. \"We wish to assure the nation that his excellency the president... and his family are safe and sound and their security is guaranteed,\" Major General Sibusiso Moyo said, slowly reading out a statement. \"We are only targeting criminals around him who are committing crimes... As soon as we have accomplished our mission we expect that the situation will return to normalcy.\" Moyo said \"this is not a military takeover of government\". But the generals\' actions posed as a major challenge to the ageing Mugabe, 93, who has ruled Zimbabwe since independence from Britain in 1980. Tensions between the veteran leader and the military, which has long helped prop up his authoritarian rule, have erupted in public in recent days. The ruling ZANU-PF party on Tuesday accused army chief General Constantino Chiwenga of \"treasonable conduct\" after he criticised Mugabe for sacking vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa. Mnangagwa\'s dismissal left Mugabe\'s wife Grace, 52, in prime position to succeed her husband as the next president -- a succession strongly opposed by senior ranks in the military. As the situation deteriorated overnight, prolonged gunfire was heard near Mugabe\'s private residence. The US embassy warned its citizens in the country to \"shelter in place\" due to \"ongoing political uncertainty\". Armoured vehicles in the capital alarmed residents as Chiwenga had warned of possible military intervention. The army\'s spokesman was not available to comment. \"The government\'s silence on the military deployments seem to confirm that President Mugabe has lost control of the situation,\" Robert Besseling, of the London-based EXX Africa risk consultancy, said. \"Any coup would be likely to involve the imposition of a curfew. \"The main indicator of a broader outbreak of violence would be the reaction of the Presidential Guard, which remains loyal to President Mugabe.\" Mugabe is the world\'s oldest head of state, but his poor health has fuelled a bitter succession battle as potential replacements jockey for position. In speeches this year, Mugabe has often slurred his words, mumbled and paused for long periods. His lengthy rule has been marked by brutal repression of dissent, mass emigration, vote-rigging and economic collapse since land reforms in 2000. The main opposition MDC party called for civilian rule to be protected. \"No one wants to see a coup... If the army takes over that will be undesirable. It will bring democracy to a halt,\" shadow defence minister Gift Chimanikire, told AFP on Tuesday. Speculation has been rife in Harare that Mugabe could seek to remove Chiwenga, who is seen as an ally of ousted Mnangagwa. Mnangagwa, 75, was widely viewed as Mugabe\'s most loyal lieutenant, having worked alongside him for decades. Earlier this year the country was gripped by a bizarre spat between Grace and Mnangagwa that included an alleged ice-cream poisoning incident that laid bare the pair\'s rivalry. Grace Mugabe -- 41 years younger than her husband -- has become increasingly active in public life in what many say was a process to help her eventually take the top job. She was granted diplomatic immunity in South Africa in August after she allegedly assaulted a model at an expensive Johannesburg hotel where the couple\'s two sons were staying. As the economy collapsed, Zimbabwe was engulfed by hyperinflation and was forced to abandon its own currency in 2009 in favour of the US dollar. The country, which has an unemployment rate of over 90 percent, is due to hold elections next year with Mugabe pledging to stand for office again.

'HARARE: Zimbabwe is under the control of the military, two days after its army chief warned President Robert Mugabe against purging the ruling party\'s senior ranks. Analysts say it appears to be the climax of a power struggle between liberation-era figures loyal to ousted vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa and forces faithful to First Lady Grace Mugabe, who is seen as vying to succeed her 93-year-old husband. Here is what we know: Armoured personnel carriers and troops were deployed onto roads leading towards Harare on Tuesday, a day after army chief General Constantino Chiwenga warned the military may intervene after Mugabe fired Mnangagwa last week. Mnangagwa was popular with security forces but had repeatedly clashed with Grace, 52, a political novice who is believed to have alarmed many senior army commanders with her open posturing and ambition. It became clear after nightfall that the manoeuvres were not routine when the armoured vehicles took up positions outside key sites of power in the capital. Shortly afterwards, a senior army officer, flanked by an air force commander, made a late night address on the ZBC state broadcaster after having apparently taken over the station\'s output. They denied staging a coup, saying they were targeting \"criminals\" close to the president. Initial reports suggest key Grace ally and leader of the ruling ZANU-PF party youth league Kudzai Chipanga is among those detained. During the late-night broadcast, the two uniformed commanders insisted that Mugabe was not under arrest. \"We wish to assure the nation that his excellency the president... and his family are safe and sound and their security is guaranteed,\" Major General Sibusiso Moyo said, reading out a prepared statement. \"We are only targeting criminals around him... this is not a military takeover of government.\" The First Family have not been seen since the start of the unrest and prolonged gunfire was heard near Mugabe\'s private residence in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Read also: Indians in Zimbabwe safe after unrest: Embassy Situation in Harare is calm. Embassy staff, Indian Community, both PIO & Expat are safe. No reason for concern and worry. — India in Zimbabwe (@IndiainZimbabwe) 1510736883000 The South African government said on Wednesday that President Jacob Zuma had spoken to Mugabe who confirmed that he was \"confined to his home\" -- but otherwise fine. President of regional heavyweight South Africa Jacob Zuma issued a statement calling for Zimbabwe to avoid \"unconstitutional changes of government\" and \"urged the Zimbabwean Defence Force to ensure... the maintenance of peace and security\". Pretoria also announced it was sending its defence and intelligence ministers to Zimbabwe on behalf of the southern African regional bloc to meet army chiefs and Mugabe. The European Union called on \"all the relevant players to move from confrontation to dialogue.\" The United States said its embassy would be closed to the public on Wednesday and called on its citizens in the country to \"shelter in place\". Britain issued a special travel alert to call on its citizens to \"avoid political activity\", warning \"the authorities have sometimes used force to suppress demonstrations\". The army\'s dramatic seizure of power from the ailing liberation leader turned autocrat has stunned the nation and plunged it into uncertainty. Mnangagwa has reportedly left South Africa by plane. If so, it could be that he may return to Zimbabwe to try to broker a resolution. However South Africa\'s warning- together with its dispatch of envoys- could complicate any efforts to hand power to an unelected civilian caretaker government. An extraordinary meeting of the ruling ZANU-PF party intended to smooth party divisions was scheduled for next month but this has now been thrown into doubt.

'HARARE: Zimbabwean military officers read an address live on state TV in the early hours of Wednesday, saying they were not launching a coup but were \"targeting criminals around\" President Robert Mugabe. \"It is not a military takeover of government,\" said one general reading a statement. \"We wish to assure the nation that his excellency the president... and his family are safe and sound and their security is guaranteed. \"We are only targeting criminals around him who are committing crimes... As soon as we have accomplished our mission we expect that the situation will return to normalcy.\" Armoured vehicles were seen on the streets near the capital Harare on Tuesday as questions mounted over whether Mugabe, who has ruled since independence from Britain in 1980, was still holding onto power. Tensions between the 93-year-old leader and the military have intensified in recent days. Prolonged gunfire erupted near Mugabe\'s private residence in the suburb of Borrowdale early Wednesday, a witness told AFP. No further details were available. The shooting came after Mugabe\'s ZANU-PF party on Tuesday accused army chief General Constantino Chiwenga of \"treasonable conduct\". The public dispute has presented a major test for Mugabe, who is in increasingly frail health. Chiwenga had demanded that Mugabe stop purges of senior party figures, including vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa, who was dismissed last week.

'HARARE: Zimbabwe was on a knife\'s edge on Thursday after the military seized power+ in what it dubbed a targeted operation against \"criminals\" in the entourage of President Robert Mugabe, who has ruled the southern African nation for almost four decades. It was not clear whether the apparent military coup+ would bring a formal end to the 93-year-old Mugabe\'s rule. The main goal of the generals appeared to be preventing Mugabe\'s wife Grace, 41 years his junior, from succeeding him. Local media reported South Africa\'s defence and state security ministers, dispatched by President Jacob Zuma as regional envoys, arrived in Zimbabwe\'s capital, Harare, on Wednesday night and were expected to meet both Mugabe and the military. Their ultimate goal was not clear. Zuma earlier called for \"calm and restraint\" and asked the defence forces \"to ensure that peace and stability are not undermined in Zimbabwe,\" South Africa\'s neighbour, which has lurched from crisis to crisis over the past two decades. The South African presidency said Mugabe had told Zuma over the phone that he was confined to his home but was otherwise fine and the military said it was keeping him and his family safe. Mugabe, still seen by many Africans as a liberation hero, is reviled in the West as a despot whose disastrous handling of the economy and willingness to resort to violence to maintain power destroyed one of Africa\'s most promising states. He plunged Zimbabwe into a fresh political crisis last week by firing his vice president and presumed successor, Emmerson Mnangagwa, 75 - known as the \"crocodile\" - for showing \"traits of disloyalty\". The generals believed that move was aimed at clearing a path for Grace Mugabe to take over and said on Monday they were prepared to \"step in\" if purges of their allies did not end. Tanks blocked roads after dark and soldiers with automatic weapons kept up their patrols, but the situation appeared calm. Whatever the final outcome, the events could signal a once-in-a-generation change for the former British colony, a regional breadbasket reduced to destitution by economic policies Mugabe\'s critics have long blamed on him.

'HARARE: Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe\'s fate hung in the balance on Friday as he apparently resisted efforts to step down in the wake of an audacious seizure of power by the army, until this week a key pillar of his 37-year-rule. The unfolding drama in the capital Harare was thrown into confusion when a smiling Mugabe was pictured shaking hands with Zimbabwe\'s military chief, the man behind the coup, raising questions about whether or not the end of an era was nigh. Mugabe unexpectedly drove on Thursday from his lavish \"Blue Roof\" compound, where he had been confined, to State House, where official media pictured him meeting military boss Constantino Chiwenga and South African mediators. The official Herald newspaper carried no reports of the meeting\'s outcome, leaving Zimbabwe\'s 13 million people in the dark about the situation. The army may want Mugabe, who has ruled Zimbabwe since independence from Britain in 1980, to go quietly and allow a smooth and bloodless transition to Emmerson Mnangagwa, the vice president Mugabe sacked last week, triggering the crisis. The main goal of the generals is to prevent Mugabe from handing power to his wife Grace, 41 years his junior, who has built a following among the ruling party\'s youth wing and appeared on the cusp of power after Mnangagwa was pushed out. Mugabe, who at 93 has appeared increasingly frail in public, is insisting he remains Zimbabwe\'s only legitimate ruler and is refusing to quit. But pressure was mounting on the former guerrilla to accept offers of a graceful exit, sources said. Zimbabwe\'s former head of intelligence, Dumiso Dabengwa, was to hold a news conference in Johannesburg at 1200 GMT. A South African government source said he expected Dabengwa, a close ally of the ousted Mnangagwa, to discuss the events in Zimbabwe. \"It seems there is some sort of agreement,\" the source said. The army\'s takeover signaled the collapse in less than 36 hours of the security, intelligence and patronage networks that sustained Mugabe through almost four decades in power and built him into the \"Grand Old Man\" of African politics. Mugabe is still seen by many Africans as a liberation hero. But he is reviled in the West as a despot whose disastrous handling of the economy and willingness to resort to violence to maintain power pauperised one of Africa\'s most promising states. Once a regional bread-basket, Zimbabwe saw its economy collapse in the wake of the seizure of white-owned farms in the early 2000s, followed by runaway money-printing that catapulted inflation to 500 billion percent in 2008.

'HARARE, Zimbabwe: Giddy with joy and finally free to speak out, vast throngs of demonstrators turned Zimbabwe\'s capital into a carnival ground on Saturday in a peaceful outpouring of disdain for President Robert Mugabe and calls for him to quit immediately. Still clinging to his now-powerless post, the longtime leader was scheduled on Sunday to discuss his expected exit with the military command that put him under house arrest. People in Harare clambered onto tanks and other military vehicles moving slowly through the crowds, danced around soldiers walking in city streets and surged in the thousands toward the building where Mugabe held official functions, a symbol of the rule of the 93-year-old man who took power after independence from white minority rule in 1980. There, in a situation that could have become tense, the protesters instead showed deference to the small number of soldiers blocking their way and eventually dispersed. It was a historic day when the old Zimbabwe, a once-promising African nation with a disintegrating economy and a mood of fear about the consequences of challenging Mugabe, became something new, with a population united, at least temporarily, in its fervor for change and a joyful openness that would have seemed fanciful even a few days ago. The euphoria, however, will eventually subside, and much depends on the behind-the-scenes maneuvering to get Mugabe to officially resign, jumpstart a new leadership that could seek to be inclusive and reduce perceptions that the military staged a coup against Mugabe. The president was to meet military commanders on Sunday in a second round of talks, state broadcaster ZBC reported. \"The common enemy is Robert Mugabe. That\'s for starters,\" said 37-year-old Talent Mudzamiri, an opposition supporter who was born soon after Zimbabwe\'s independence. He had a warning for whoever takes over Zimbabwe: \"If the next leader does the same, we are going to come out again.\" Many Zimbabweans believe the most likely candidate will be Emmerson Mnangagwa, a former vice president with close military ties whose dismissal by Mugabe triggered the intervention of the armed forces, which sent troops and tanks into the streets this week, effectively taking over the country. The increasing presidential ambitions of Mugabe\'s wife Grace, a polarizing figure who denounced Mnangagwa amid a factional battle within the ruling ZANU-PF party, alarmed those who feared a dynastic succession. \"Leadership is not sexually transmitted,\" read a poster at the Harare rallies. Other signs denounced \"Gucci Grace,\" a reference to the first lady\'s record of high-end shopping expeditions outside Zimbabwe, which suffered hyperinflation in the past and is currently struggling with a cash shortage and massive unemployment. The discussions over Mugabe\'s fate come ahead of a key ruling party congress next month, as well as scheduled elections next year. The president, who is believed to be staying at his private home in Harare, a well-guarded compound known as the Blue Roof, is reported to have asked for more time in office. He has been deserted by most of his allies, with others arrested. The ruling party has turned on him, asking for a Central Committee meeting this weekend to recall both him and his wife, who heads the women\'s league of the party. Impeachment is also a possibility when Parliament resumes Tuesday. Even as concerns remained about who next would be in charge and what freedoms might be available if the military lingers in power — or if Mugabe\'s recently fired deputy leads a new government — people reveled Saturday in the rare chance to express themselves freely. In Harare, people ran through intersections, raising their arms in triumph. Young men shouted, laughed and embraced. Others danced on top of moving buses. One man stripped to his underwear and danced on a car roof. Some marchers had posters with an image of the military commander who swept in to take control, with the slogan: \"Go, go, our general!!!\" Demonstrators handed flags to soldiers, who accepted and waved. \"It\'s like Christmas,\" said one marcher, Fred Mubay, who said Zimbabweans have been suffering for a long time. Veterans of the long war against white minority rule, once close allies of Mugabe, took part in the demonstration, along with opposition activists who long have faced police crackdowns by the Mugabe government. Thousands gathered for speeches at the Zimbabwe Grounds, where Zimbabweans assembled to cheer Mugabe\'s return from exile in 1980 after the liberation war. Elizabeth Sithole, 60, said her husband died in 2004, she lives with her children in a 2-room apartment and her business selling vegetables has collapsed. On Saturday, though, she had a big smile while standing near soldiers in downtown Harare. \"I\'m very happy,\" she said.
